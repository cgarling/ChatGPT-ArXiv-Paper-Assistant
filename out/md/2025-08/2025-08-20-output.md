## 1. [SPARCS -- combining radiation hydrodynamics with non-equilibrium metal chemistry in the SWIFT astrophysical code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13277) <a id="link1"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13277

**Authors:** Tsang Keung Chan, Alexander J. Richings, Tom Theuns, Yuankang Liu, Matthieu Schaller, Mladen Ivkovic

**Abstract:** We present SPARCS, which combines the moment-based radiative transfer method SPH-M1RT with the non-equilibrium metal chemistry solver CHIMES in the modern highly-parallel astrophysical code SWIFT. SPARCS enables on-the-fly radiation hydrodynamics simulations, with multi-frequency ultraviolet radiative transfer coupled with all ionisation states of 11 major elements, in the presence of dust, cosmic ray ionization and heating, and self-gravity. Direct radiation pressure on gas and dust is also accounted for. We validate SPARCS against analytic solutions and standard photo-ionization codes such as CLOUDY in idealized tests. As an example application, we simulate an ionization front propagating through an inhomogeneous interstellar medium with solar metallicity. We produce mock optical emission line observations with the level population calculation code HyLight and the diagnostic radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that non-equilibrium effects and inhomogeneities can boost the low ion fractions by up to an order of magnitude. Possible applications of SPARCS include studying the dynamical impact of radiation on gas in star-forming regions, and in the interstellar and circumgalactic medium, as well as interpreting line diagnostics in such environments, and galactic or AGN outflows.

**Comment:** SPARCS is a new radiation hydrodynamics code combining radiative transfer and non-equilibrium metal chemistry, enabling simulations of radiation's impact on gas in star-forming regions, the ISM, and the circumgalactic medium. This matches the 'Numerical Galaxy Simulations' criterion, especially as it enables new physics (multi-frequency UV RT, non-equilibrium chemistry) and is applicable to ISM/CGM studies and outflows.

## 2. [A Catalog of M&M Eclipsing Binaries with TESS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13941) <a id="link2"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13941

**Authors:** Dominic Oddo, Diana Dragomir, Brian P. Powell, Veselin B. Kostov, Te Han

**Abstract:** We present a catalog of 1292 low-mass (M&M) short-period eclipsing binaries observed by the TESS mission. Eclipsing binaries are useful for many aspects of stellar astrophysics, including calibrating stellar models. Catalogs of eclipsing binary properties provide context for population-level inferences. In this work, we present our selection criteria for our catalog, along with steps taken to characterize both the orbital and physical properties of our EBs. We further detail crucial steps in vetting our catalog to ensure that the stars in our catalog have a high likelihood of being true M&Ms. We compare distributions of orbital and physical properties to other relevant datasets. Our sample consists primarily of binaries with short-period, circular orbits and often manifest as high-mass ratio "twin" M&Ms. We find that M&Ms do not exhibit an overdensity of contact binaries, which is different from previous results for solar-type binaries. Further, we find a tidal circularization period of approximately 2.7 days, which is significantly shorter compared to the literature value of 7 days. Finally, we explore the prospects for additional companions to our M&Ms. Future avenues include spectroscopic follow-up of bright M&Ms to better-characterize low-mass stellar properties and a deeper assessment of the presence of tertiary companions.

**Comment:** Presents a catalog of low-mass eclipsing binaries from TESS, which can be used to calibrate stellar models. This directly matches the 'Stellar Models' criterion, as eclipsing binaries are crucial for testing and calibrating stellar evolutionary tracks.

## 3. [The Hidden Role of Anisotropies in Shaping Structure Formation in Cosmological N-Body Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13765) <a id="link3"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13765

**Authors:** Francesco Sylos Labini

**Abstract:** Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically generated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a correlated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the Zel'dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point statistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces subtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These anisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through directional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances. Analyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with varying resolutions, initial redshifts, and box sizes, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but are amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that persist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our findings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts -- emerging from the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice -- not genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model. These results underscore the importance of critically reassessing how initial conditions are constructed, particularly when probing the large-scale, quasi-linear regime of structure formation.

**Comment:** Examines numerical artifacts in cosmological N-body simulations, specifically the impact of anisotropies from initial conditions on structure formation. This is relevant to the 'Numerical Galaxy Simulations' criterion, as it addresses the reliability and construction of galaxy simulations, which is important for interpreting results in near-field cosmology and related fields.

## 4. [Development of Turbulence in Post-shock Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13291) <a id="link4"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13291

**Authors:** Michael M. Foley, Philip Mocz, Blakesley Burkhart, Lars Hernquist, Alyssa Goodman

**Abstract:** Supersonic isothermal turbulence is ubiquitous in the interstellar medium. This work presents high-resolution AREPO hydrodynamical simulations of isolated shocks moving through supersonic turbulence to study the development and evolution of turbulence in the pre- and post-shock regions. We find that shocks can amplify turbulent energy in the post-shock region while inducing a preferential orientation for the vorticity. This results in the creation of anisotropic turbulence in the post-shock region. Turbulent energy and dissipation are also strongly enhanced near the shock front. By applying typical scalings from the cold neutral medium to simulations, we find that shocks moving into turbulence on the scale of superbubbles can generate compressive flows on the order of $10^{3} M_{\odot}$/Myr. Our results also show good agreement with related studies on turbulent fluctuations generated by shocks in pure fluid mechanics.

**Comment:** High-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of shocks in supersonic turbulence in the ISM are presented. While the work is relevant to ISM physics and turbulence, it does not directly address galaxy-scale simulations, star formation driven outflows, or dwarf galaxy properties. The focus is on fluid mechanics and turbulence development.

## 5. [MeerKAT-derived HI kinematics and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation in the X-ray luminous cluster Abell 3408](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13312) <a id="link5"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13312

**Authors:** Xola Ndaliso, Tariq Blecher, Roger Deane, Ed Elson

**Abstract:** Significant advances in observational capabilities are continuously transforming our understanding of the dense environment of galaxy clusters and its impact on individual galaxies. Discerning between intrinsic and externally-induced properties of galaxies, including their gas kinematics, is a key diagnostic in the field of galaxy evolution. In this work, we present MeerKAT HI spectral line observations of the redshift z $\sim$ 0.042 galaxy cluster Abell 3408. A total of 64 galaxies are detected in HI in this X-ray-luminous galaxy cluster (L$_{X}$ $\sim$ 3 $\times$ 10$^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$). We model the HI morphology and gas kinematics of the individual galaxies, using a semi-automated pipeline based on CANNUBI and pyBBarolo. The pipeline was developed and tested as part of this study. Of the 64 galaxies detected in the cluster, we successfully modelled 16, while the remaining galaxies exhibit disturbed HI morphologies, insufficient angular or velocity resolution. We combine the galaxies with converged kinematic fits with 67 field galaxies from the MeerKAT spectral line survey early science data ($\langle$z$\rangle$ = 0.0435) to produce a measurement of the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (bTFr) that encompasses a broader range of environment and provides a useful comparison. We find a slope ($\alpha$ = 3.66$^{+0.32}_{-0.28}$) for this relation, which is consistent with that found from the MIGHTEE bTFr derived from the same definition. Interestingly, HI detections of the Abell 3408 galaxy cluster galaxies are seen to extend the bTFr of the MIGHTEE sample, both in mass and velocity, despite their cluster environment.

**Comment:** This paper presents HI kinematics and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation for galaxies in a cluster environment, using MeerKAT observations. While it discusses galaxy evolution and gas kinematics, the focus is on cluster galaxies and the Tully-Fisher relation, not on dwarf satellites, resolved star formation histories, or quenching in dwarfs.

## 6. [Narrowing the discovery space of the cosmological 21-cm signal using multi-wavelength constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13761) <a id="link6"></a>

**Authors:** Jiten Dhandha, Anastasia Fialkov, Thomas Gessey-Jones, Harry T. J. Bevins, Sandro Tacchella, Simon Pochinda, Eloy de Lera Acedo, Saurabh Singh, Rennan Barkana

**Abstract:** The cosmic 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the early Universe, owing to its sensitivity to the thermal state of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) and properties of the first luminous sources. In this work, we constrain the 21-cm signal and infer IGM properties by leveraging multi-wavelength synergies. This builds on our earlier study, where we developed the synergy between high-redshift UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), cosmic X-ray and radio backgrounds (CXB and CRB), 21-cm global signal non-detection from SARAS~3, and 21-cm power spectrum upper limits from HERA, to constrain the astrophysical properties of Population II galaxies. Through a combination of CXB and HERA data, we find the IGM kinetic temperature to be $T_\text{K}(z=15)\lesssim 7.7~\text{K}$, $2.5~\text{K} \lesssim T_\text{K}(z=10) \lesssim 66~\text{K}$, and $20~\text{K}\lesssim T_\text{K}(z=6) \lesssim 2078~\text{K}$ at 95\% credible interval (C.I.). Similarly, CRB and HERA data place an upper limit on the radio emission efficiency of galaxies, giving $T_\text{rad}(z=15) \lesssim 47~\text{K}$, $T_\text{rad}(z=10)\lesssim 51~\text{K}$, and $T_\text{rad}(z=6)\lesssim 101~\text{K}$. These constraints, strengthened by the inclusion of UVLFs from HST and JWST, allow us to place the first \textit{lower bound} on the cosmic 21-cm signal. We infer an absorption trough of depth ${-201~\text{mK}\lesssim T_\text{21,min} \lesssim -68~\text{mK}}$ at $z_\text{min}\approx10-16$, and a power spectrum of $8.7~\text{mK}^2 < \Delta_{21}^2(z=15) < 197~\text{mK}^2$ at $k=0.35~h\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. Our results provide promising predictions for upcoming 21-cm experiments, and highlight the power of multi-wavelength synergies in constraining the early Universe.

**Comment:** Focuses on the cosmological 21-cm signal and multi-wavelength constraints on the early universe, including UV luminosity functions and properties of Population II galaxies. While it deals with galaxy formation and evolution, it does not specifically address near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or dwarf galaxies. The relevance is borderline as it may inform galaxy formation models but is not directly focused on the core topics.

## 7. [Cosmology from a joint analysis of second and third order shear statistics with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 3 data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14019) <a id="link7"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.14019

**Authors:** Sunao Sugiyama, Rafael C. H. Gomes, Bhuvnesh Jain

**Abstract:** We present a joint cosmological analysis of the two-point correlation function and the aperture-mass skewness measured from the Year 3 data of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-Y3). The aperture-mass skewness is a compressed representation of three-point shear information, designed to capture non-Gaussian features while keeping the data vector computationally tractable. We find that including the aperture-mass skewness improves the $S_8$-$\Omega_m$ figure of merit by 80% compared to the 2PCF-only case, primarily due to the breaking of degeneracies. Our joint analysis yields a constraint of $S_8=0.736\pm0.020$, which is slightly lower than the two-point-only result and increases the tension with Planck 2018 to 3.2$\sigma$ in the $S_8$-$\Omega_m$ plane. The two- and three-point statistics are found to be internally consistent across redshift bins and angular scales, and we detect no significant intrinsic alignment signal. We also explore extensions to the $w$CDM model and find no evidence for deviations from a cosmological constant. This work demonstrates the feasibility and scientific value of incorporating third-order shear statistics into weak lensing cosmology and provides a practical pathway for similar analyses in future Stage-IV surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman.

**Comment:** Joint cosmological analysis using weak lensing statistics from Subaru HSC. While it is cosmology-focused, it does not address near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or dwarf galaxies. The relevance is borderline as weak lensing can inform galaxy formation models but is not directly focused on the core topics.

## 8. [From ANN to BNN: Inferring Reionization Parameters using Uncertainty-aware Emulators of 21-cm Summaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13261) <a id="link8"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13261

**Authors:** Yashrajsinh Mahida, Sanjay Kumar Yadav, Suman Majumdar, Leon Noble, Chandra Shekhar Murmu, Saswata Dasgupta, Sohini Dutta, Himanshu Tiwari, Abinash Kumar Shaw

**Abstract:** Inferring astrophysical parameters from radio interferometric observations of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a challenging yet crucial task. The 21-cm signal from EoR is expected to be highly non-Gaussian; therefore, we need to use higher-order statistics, e.g., bispectrum. Moreover, the forward modeling of the signal and its statistics for a varying set of model parameters requires rerunning the simulations many times, which is computationally very expensive. To overcome this challenge, many artificial neural network (ANN) based emulators have been introduced, which produce the 21-cm summaries in a fraction of the time. However, ANN emulators have a drawback: they can only produce point-value predictions; thus, they fail to capture the uncertainty associated with their predictions. Therefore, when such emulators are used in the Bayesian inference pipeline, they cannot naturally propagate their prediction uncertainties to the estimated model parameters. To address this problem, we have developed Bayesian neural network (BNN) emulators for the 21-cm signal statistics, which provide the posterior distribution of the predicted signal statistics, including their prediction uncertainty. We use these BNN emulators in our Bayesian inference pipeline to infer the EoR parameters through 21-cm summaries of the mock observation of 21-cm signal with telescopic noise for $1000$ hr of SKA-LOW observation. We show that BNN emulators can capture the prediction uncertainty for the 21-cm power spectrum and bispectrum, and using these emulators in the inference pipeline provides better and tighter constraints on them. We reduced the training dataset and showed that, for smaller training datasets, BNN outperforms the ANN emulators. We also show that using the bispectrum as a summary statistic gives better constraints on EoR parameters than the power spectrum.

**Comment:** Develops Bayesian neural network emulators for inferring reionization parameters from 21-cm signal statistics. While it deals with galaxy formation and evolution during reionization, it does not specifically address near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or dwarf galaxies. The relevance is borderline as it may inform galaxy formation models but is not directly focused on the core topics.

## 9. [From Wide Triples to UCXBs: Multimessenger Detection of Dynamically-formed Black Hole-White Dwarf Systems with LISA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13264) <a id="link9"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13264

**Authors:** Zeyuan Xuan, Cheyanne Shariat, Smadar Naoz

**Abstract:** Ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) are a subclass of low-mass X-ray binaries characterized by tight orbits and degenerate donors, which pose significant challenges to our understanding of their formation. Recent discoveries of black hole (BH) candidates with main-sequence (MS) or red giant (RG) companions suggest that BH-white dwarf (BH-WD) binaries are common in the Galactic field. Motivated by these observations and the fact that most massive stars are born in triples, we show that wide BH-WD systems can naturally form UCXBs through the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. Notably, EKL-driven eccentricity excitations combined with gravitational wave (GW) emission and WD dynamical tides can effectively shrink and circularize the orbit, leading to mass-transferring BH-WD binaries. These systems represent promising multimessenger sources in both X-ray and GW observations. Specifically, we predict that the wide triple channel can produce $\sim5-45$ ($\sim1-8$) detectable UCXBs in the Milky Way (Andromeda galaxy), including $\sim1$ system observable by the mHz GW detection of LISA. If the final WD mass can reach sufficiently small values, this channel could contribute up to $\sim 10^3$ UCXBs in the Galaxy. Furthermore, the identification of tertiary companions in observed UCXBs would provide direct evidence for this formation pathway and yield unique insights into their dynamical origins.

**Comment:** Discusses the formation of ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) from black hole-white dwarf systems, including predictions for their numbers in the Milky Way and Andromeda. The focus on the Milky Way and Andromeda, and the mention of dynamically-formed binaries, provides a weak link to near-field cosmology, but the main topic is compact object binaries, not galaxy structure or evolution.

**Abstract:** Many applications in transient science, gravitational wave follow-up, and galaxy population studies require all-sky galaxy catalogs with reliable distances, extents, and stellar masses. However, existing catalogs often lack completeness beyond $\sim 100$ Mpc, suffer from stellar contamination, or do not provide homogeneous stellar mass estimates and size information. Our goal is to build a high-purity, high-completeness, all-sky galaxy catalog out to 2,000 Mpc, specifically designed to support time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. We combined major galaxy catalogs and deep imaging surveys -- including the Legacy Surveys, Pan-STARRS, DELVE, and SDSS -- and added spectroscopic, photometric, and redshift-independent distances. We cleaned the sample using the Gaia catalog to remove stars, and visually inspected all ambiguous cases below 100 Mpc through a classification platform that gathered 20,000 expert votes. Stellar masses were estimated using optical and mid-infrared profile-fit photometry, and we improved the accuracy of photometric distances by combining multiple independent estimates. The resulting catalog, REGALADE, includes nearly 80 million galaxies with distances under 2,000 Mpc. It provides stellar masses for 88\% of the sample and ellipse fits for 80\%. REGALADE is more than 90\% complete for massive galaxies out to 360 Mpc. In science tests, it recovers 60\% more known supernova hosts, doubles the number of low-luminosity transient hosts, and identifies more reliable hosts for ultraluminous and hyperluminous X-ray sources. REGALADE is the most complete and reliable all-sky galaxy catalog to date for the nearby Universe, built for real-world applications in transient and multi-messenger astrophysics. The full dataset, visual classifications, and code will be released to support broad community use.

**Comment:** Presents a new all-sky galaxy catalog with improved completeness and stellar mass estimates. While useful for galaxy population studies, it does not focus on dwarf satellites, resolved star formation histories, or simulations. May be tangentially useful for near-field cosmology, but not directly aligned.

## 11. [Constraints on Compact Dark Matter Population from Micro-lensing Effect of Gravitational Wave for the third-generation gravitational Wave Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13577) <a id="link11"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13577

**Authors:** Xin-Yi Lin, Xi-Jing Wang, Huan Zhou, Zhengxiang Li, Kai Liao, Zong-Hong Zhu

**Abstract:** Since the pioneering detection of gravitational wave (GW) from a binary black hole merger by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, GW has become a powerful tool for probing astrophysics and cosmology. If compact dark matter (DM) candidates, e.g. primordial black holes, contribute a substantial fraction of the DM component across a broad mass spectrum, their gravitational influence would imprint distinctive micro-lensing signatures on long-wavelength GW signals. In this paper, we propose a systematic method ranging from simulating micro-lensing GWs to constraining population information of compact DM, combining future third-generation ground-based GW detector, i.e. Einstein Telescope, with a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework. This approach enables us to analyze micro-lensing signatures in GW events and probe the potential contribution of compact DM objects to the DM budget of universe. For a population with a power-law mass function, we demonstrate that detecting 8 micro-lensing GW events out of $10^4$ observed binary black holes would constrain the compact DM abundance to $\log_{10}(f_{\rm CO})=-2.76^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$.

## 12. [Effective bias expansion for circumventing 21 cm foregrounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13268) <a id="link12"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13268

**Authors:** Wenzer Qin, Kai-Feng Chen, Katelin Schutz, Adrian Liu

**Abstract:** The 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen is a promising probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) but suffers from contamination by spectrally smooth foregrounds, which obscure the large-scale signal along the line of sight. We explore the possibility of indirectly extracting the 21 cm signal in the presence of foregrounds by taking advantage of nonlinear couplings between large and small scales, both at the level of the density field and a biased tracer of that field. When combined with effective field theory techniques, bias expansions allow for a systematic treatment of nonlinear mode-couplings in the map between the underlying density field and the 21 cm field. We apply an effective bias expansion to density information generated with $\texttt{21cmFAST}$ using a variety of assumptions about which information can be recovered by different surveys and density estimation techniques. We find that the 21 cm signal produced by our effective bias expansion, combined with our least optimistic foreground assumptions, produces ~30% cross-correlations with the true 21 cm field. Providing complementary density information from high-redshift galaxy surveys yields a cross-correlation of 50-70%. The techniques presented here may be combined with foreground mitigation strategies in order to improve the recovery of the large-scale 21 cm signal.

**Comment:** Presents a method for extracting the 21 cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization, focusing on foreground mitigation. While 21 cm cosmology is important, the work does not focus on near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, or resolved star formation histories.

**Authors:** Sizheng Ma, Luis Lehner, Huan Yang, Lawrence E. Kidder, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Mark A. Scheel

**Abstract:** Gravity in nonlinear and dynamical regimes underpins spectacular astrophysical phenomena and observable consequences, from the early universe to black hole collisions. In these extreme environments, inverse energy cascades - mediated by nonlinear interactions - may help explain the near scale-invariance of cosmic structure and the simplicity of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Yet the presence, characteristics, and generality of such interactions in full General Relativity remain largely unexplored. Here we show that two types of nonlinear interactions - a four-mode and a three-mode interaction - emerge in the fully nonlinear regime, and can indeed channel inverse energy cascades by inducing resonant and anti-damping instabilities. This establishes what was previously only hinted at in highly specialized perturbative contexts. We further demonstrate a ``laminar'' to ``turbulent'' transition for the largest-possible angular structure in General Relativity, whereas finer structures remain persistently turbulent. Our results reveal the impact and generality of these nonlinear interactions (instabilities), which can be key to understanding observations ranging from cosmological to kilometer scales. We anticipate that our work will shed new light on nonlinear gravitational phenomena and their consequences, such as constructing gravitational wave templates and testing General Relativity in the most extreme regime. Moreover, our work is a starting point for addressing nonlinear gravitational interactions using ideas and methods inspired by fluid dynamics.

**Comment:** The paper investigates nonlinear gravitational interactions and turbulence in General Relativity, with implications for gravitational wave observations and cosmological structure. However, it does not address galaxy simulations, star formation, or dwarf galaxy properties directly.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13541

**Authors:** Fan Zhang

**Abstract:** In this note, we suggest the possibility that an elucidation of the nature of the numerous Little Red Dots (LRDs) at high redshifts, may facilitate the resolution of another concurrent cosmic puzzle, namely reionization. Specifically, it is hypothesized that intergalactic HI gas is compelled by the tidal field associated with a growing gravitational entropy, in the form of gas streams, into colliding at the LRD sites. The resulting shock heating and compression encourage starburst activities, which subsequently photo-ionize the gas into HII, that in turn shines into the rest-optical via bremsstrahlung radiation within the minimal-timescale-cutoff (i.e., red) regime, before escaping back into the intergalactic space, propelled by the newly fusion-injected energy.

**Comment:** The paper discusses the role of 'Little Red Dots' at high redshift in cosmic reionization, hypothesizing about starburst activities and their impact on the intergalactic medium. While it touches on star formation and outflows, the focus is on high-redshift phenomena and reionization, not on resolved star formation histories or dwarf galaxy quenching in the local universe.

## 15. [Compact groups of galaxies in the TNG100 simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13293) <a id="link15"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13293

**Authors:** Bruno M. Celiz, Jos\'e A. Benavides, Mario G. Abadi

**Abstract:** Using the TNG100 cosmological simulation, we study the formation and evolution of compact groups of galaxies. Over a redshift range of $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.2$, we identify these compact groups as FoF galaxy groups with high mean surface brightness ($\overline{\mu}_r < 26.33 ~ \mathrm{mag~arcsec^{-2}}$) and a minimum of 4 galaxy members. Typically, our compact groups have a median characteristic size of $\sim$$150$ kpc, 1D velocity dispersions of $150 ~ {\rm km ~ s^{-1}}$, and stellar masses around $2\times 10^{11} ~ M_{\odot}$. Roughly 1\% of galaxies of stellar mass above $10^9 ~ M_{\odot}$ lie in physically dense compact groups. We found that these systems do not constitute a separate category within the broader population of galaxy groups; instead, they represent the lower end of the size distribution in the sequence of galaxy group sizes. We traced their evolution backward in time, revealing that they initially form as galaxies systems with a mean low surface brightness that systematically increases to a peak value before stabilizing over time, exhibiting oscillatory behaviour over the following several Gyrs during which mergers may occur. Mergers often transform compact groups with typically four members into galaxy pairs or triplets, which may eventually can increase again their number of members accreting a new galaxy. Nevertheless, the full merging of all constituent galaxies into a single massive galaxy is a rare phenomenon.

**Comment:** Analyzes compact groups of galaxies in the TNG100 simulation. While it uses a major galaxy simulation, the focus is on compact groups with typical stellar masses around 2e11 Msun, which are much more massive than dwarf galaxies. No direct focus on near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or quenching in dwarfs.

## 16. [Beyond the two-point correlation: constraining primordial non-gaussianity with density perturbation moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13381) <a id="link16"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13381

**Authors:** Ethan Vislosky, Zachery Brown, Regina Demina, Edmond Chaussidon

**Abstract:** Constraining primordial non-Gaussianities (PNGs) in the large-scale cosmic structure (LSS) is an important step in understanding properties of the early universe, specifically in distinguishing between different inflationary models. Measuring PNG relies on evaluating the scale-dependent correlations in the density field. New summary statistics beyond the two- and three-point correlation functions in configuration space and their Fourier-space counterparts, the power- and bi-spectrum may provide increased sensitivity. We introduce a new method for extracting the PNG signal imprinted on the LSS by using the first three Gaussian moments of the normalized correlation in density perturbations, evaluated at varying distance scales. We aim to assess this method's sensitivity to local PNG, parameterized by $f_ {\mathrm{NL}}$. We perform spherical convolutions at a range of scales on dark matter halo simulations to measure the scale-dependent correlations in the density field. From these, we compute the first three moments and compare them to a model expectation vector, parameterized to the second power in $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$. Our method provides about 21% improvement in sensitivity to $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ with respect to using the two point correlation function alone. Notably, we find that the second moment alone carries nearly as much constraining power as the mean, highlighting the potential of higher-order statistics. Given its simplicity and efficiency, this framework is well-suited for application to current and upcoming large-scale surveys such as DESI.

**Comment:** This work introduces a new method for constraining primordial non-Gaussianity using higher-order statistics in large-scale structure. While it is cosmology-focused, it does not address near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations. The focus is on statistical methods for early universe properties.

## 17. [The Milky Way is a less massive galaxy--new estimates of the Milky Way's local and global stellar masses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13665) <a id="link17"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13665

**Authors:** Jianhui Lian (Yunnan Uni.), Tao Wang (Yunnan Uni.), Qikang Feng (Peking Uni.), Yang Huang (U of Chinese Academy of Sciences), Helong Guo (Yunnan Uni.)

**Abstract:** Stellar mass is the most fundamental property of a galaxy. While it has been robustly measured for millions of external galaxies, it remains poorly constrained for the Milky Way because of the strong selection effect from our inside perspective. In this work, we reconstruct the intrinsic vertical mass density profile in the solar neighborhood and the radial mass density profile across the entire Galaxy using data from the Gaia and APOGEE surveys, following careful correction for the selection function. The local density profile exhibits strong north-south asymmetry in the geometric thick disk regime and increases steeply toward the disk mid-plane, favoring an exponential model over the sech$^2$ model. Integrating the local vertical density profile yields a surface stellar mass density of 31.563$\pm$2.813(syst.)$\pm$0.024(stoch.)~${\rm M_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$, of which 25.074 and 6.489~${\rm M_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$ correspond to living stars and stellar remnants, respectively. The radial surface mass density profile {of the Milky Way} shares the same flat inner component as observed in the brightness profile. With this mass density profile {and local mass density from Gaia}, we derive a new estimate of the total stellar mass of the Milky Way of 2.607$\pm$0.353(syst.)$\pm$0.085(stoch.)${\rm \times10^{10}M_{\odot}}$, a factor of two lower than the previous results. This discrepancy arises primarily from the inner disk profile, which was previously unavailable and extrapolated from the outer disk profile. The lower stellar mass estimate of the Milky Way significantly reduces its rarity in terms of supermassive black hole mass among external galaxies and implies a larger dark matter-to-baryon mass ratio in the inner Galaxy.

**Comment:** The paper provides new estimates of the Milky Way's stellar mass and its density profile using Gaia and APOGEE data. While it is focused on the Milky Way, it does not address satellite galaxies, near-field cosmology, or resolved star formation histories. The focus is on the global and local properties of the Milky Way's disk and mass.

## 18. [Triples as Links between Binary Black Hole Mergers, their Electromagnetic Counterparts, and Galactic Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13270) <a id="link18"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13270

**Authors:** Smadar Naoz, Zoltan Haiman, Eliot Quataert, Liz Holzknecht

**Abstract:** We propose a formation pathway linking black holes (BHs) observed in gravitational-wave (GW) mergers, wide BH-stellar systems uncovered by Gaia, and accreting low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). In this scenario, a stellar-mass BH binary undergoes isolated binary evolution and merges while hosting a distant, dynamically unimportant tertiary stellar companion. The tertiary becomes relevant only after the merger, when the remnant BH receives a GW recoil kick. Depending on the kick velocity and system configuration, the outcome can be: (i) a bright electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the GW merger; (ii) an LMXB; (iii) a wide BH-stellar companion resembling the Gaia BH population; or (iv) an unbound, isolated BH. Modeling the three-body dynamics, we find that $\sim 0.02\%$ of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) mergers may be followed by an EM counterpart within $\sim$10 days, produced by tidal disruption of the star by the BH. The flare is likely brightest in the optical-UV and lasts days to weeks; in some cases, partial disruption causes recurring flares with a period of $\sim$2 months. We further estimate that this channel can produce $\sim 1-10\%$ of Gaia BH systems in the Milky Way. This scenario provides the first physically motivated link between GW sources, Gaia BHs, and some X-ray binaries, and predicts a rare but robust pathway for EM counterparts to binary BH mergers, potentially detectable in LVK's O5 run.

**Comment:** Proposes a formation pathway linking black holes observed in GW mergers, Gaia BHs, and X-ray binaries. Focuses on black hole populations and their dynamics, not on dwarf galaxies, star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

## 19. [Field-level Reconstruction from Foreground-Contaminated 21-cm Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13265) <a id="link19"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13265

**Authors:** Shu-Fan Chen, Kai-Feng Chen, Cora Dvorkin

**Abstract:** Current and upcoming 21-cm experiments will soon be able to map 21-cm spatial fluctuations in three dimensions for a wide range of redshifts. However, bright foreground contamination and the nature of radio interferometry create significant challenges, making it difficult to access rich cosmological information from the Fourier modes that lie within the "foreground wedge". In this work, we introduce two approaches aiming to reconstruct the full 21-cm density field, including the missing modes in the wedge: (a) a field-level inference under an effective field theory (EFT) framework; (b) a diffusion-based deep generative model trained on simulations. Under the EFT framework, we implement a fully differentiable forward model that maps the initial conditions of matter fluctuations to the observed, foreground-filtered 21-cm maps. This enables a gradient-based sampler to simultaneously sample the initial conditions and bias parameters, allowing a physically motivated mode reconstruction. Alternatively, we apply a variational diffusion model to perform 21-cm density reconstruction at the map level. Our model is trained on semi-numerical simulations over a wide range of astrophysical parameters. Our results from both approaches should provide improved cosmological constraints from the field level and also enable cross-correlation between experiments that have little or no overlapping modes.

**Comment:** Develops methods for reconstructing 21-cm density fields from foreground-contaminated maps. While relevant for cosmology, the focus is on large-scale structure and not on near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, or resolved star formation histories.

**Abstract:** We present a cosmological analysis of the third-order aperture mass statistic using Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) data. We perform a complete tomographic measurement of the three-point correlation function of the Y3 weak lensing shape catalog with the four fiducial source redshift bins. Building upon our companion methodology paper, we apply a pipeline that combines the two-point function $\xi_{\pm}$ with the mass aperture skewness statistic $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$, which is an efficient compression of the full shear three-point function. We use a suite of simulated shear maps to obtain a joint covariance matrix. By jointly analyzing $\xi_\pm$ and $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ measured from DES Y3 data with a $\Lambda$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.780\pm0.015$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.266^{+0.039}_{-0.040}$, yielding 111% of figure-of-merit improvement in $\Omega_m$-$S_8$ plane relative to $\xi_{\pm}$ alone, consistent with expectations from simulated likelihood analyses. With a $w$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.749^{+0.027}_{-0.026}$ and $w_0=-1.39\pm 0.31$, which gives an improvement of $22\%$ on the joint $S_8$-$w_0$ constraint. Our results are consistent with $w_0=-1$. Our new constraints are compared to CMB data from the Planck satellite, and we find that with the inclusion of $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ the existing tension between the data sets is at the level of $2.3\sigma$. We show that the third-order statistic enables us to self-calibrate the mean photometric redshift uncertainty parameter of the highest redshift bin with little degradation in the figure of merit. Our results demonstrate the constraining power of higher-order lensing statistics and establish $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ as a practical observable for joint analyses in current and future surveys.

**Comment:** This paper presents cosmological constraints from weak lensing statistics using DES Y3 data. While it is relevant to cosmology, it does not focus on near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, or any of the other specific core topics.

## 21. [MrMARTIAN: A Multi-resolution Mass Reconstruction Algorithm Combining Free-form and Analytic Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13262) <a id="link21"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13262

**Authors:** Sangjun Cha, M. James Jee

**Abstract:** We present ${\tt MrMARTIAN}$ (Multi-resolution MAximum-entropy Reconstruction Technique Integrating Analytic Node), a new hybrid strong lensing (SL) modeling algorithm. By incorporating physically motivated analytic nodes into the free-form method ${\tt MARS}$, ${\tt MrMARTIAN}$ enables stable and flexible mass reconstructions while mitigating oversmoothing in the inner mass profile. Its multi-resolution framework increases the degrees of freedom in regions with denser strong lensing constraints, thereby enhancing computational efficiency for a fixed number of free parameters. We evaluate the performance of ${\tt MrMARTIAN}$ using publicly available simulated SL data and find that it consistently outperforms ${\tt MARS}$ in recovering both mass and magnification. In particular, it delivers significantly more stable reconstructions when multiple images are sparsely distributed. Finally, we apply ${\tt MrMARTIAN}$ to the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1--2403, incorporating two analytic nodes centered on the northeastern and southwestern BCGs. Our mass model, constrained by 412 multiple images, achieves an image-plane rms scatter of ~0".11, the smallest to date for this dataset.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new strong lensing mass reconstruction algorithm and applies it to a galaxy cluster. While it is a numerical method for mass modeling, it is focused on galaxy clusters and not on dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, or the other core topics.

**Authors:** T. B\"ohm, M. Holschneider, P. Petit, F. Ligni\`eres, F. Paletou, C. P. Folsom, M. Rainer

**Abstract:** Monitoring magnetic and activity variations in A- and B-type stars with ultra-weak magnetic fields is essential to understand the origin and evolution of these fields in this region of the HR diagram, with Vega standing as the prototype of this category. We collected high-resolution spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric data with SOPHIE (OHP, 2018) and with NARVAL/NEO-NARVAL (TBL, 2018, 2023, and 2024), yielding a total of 13108 individual spectra. Magnetic field maps were reconstructed using the Zeeman-Doppler Imaging method, while brightness maps were derived with a dedicated code developed for this purpose. The average magnetic field confirms a negative radial-field spot at the pole with stable strength, while the maps reveal the long-term stability of an oblique dipole together with smaller magnetic structures consistently detected across observing epochs. In contrast, brightness maps show strong variations in the location of surface spots on timescales of years, possibly shorter, although the spot contrast remains nearly unchanged between 2012, 2018, 2023, and 2024, with a normalized spectral amplitude of 0.0003. No direct correlation between magnetic and brightness features could be established in the simultaneous SOPHIE and NARVAL dataset of 2018. These results suggest that Vega hosts both a persistent fossil magnetic field and a dynamo-generated component, most likely concentrated in equatorial regions.

**Authors:** V. Delfavero, S. Ray, H. E. Cook, K. Nathaniel, B. McKernan, K. E. S. Ford, J. Postiglione, E. McPike, R. O'Shaughnessy

**Abstract:** The recent binary black hole (BBH) merger GW231123 consisted of the merger of two intermediate mass black holes (IMBH) which appear to have large spin magnitudes. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are very promising environments for IMBH mergers and growth due to high escape velocities. Here we demonstrate how GW231123 can be produced in the AGN channel. Using the McFACTS code, we explore the impact of various choices of the black hole (BH) initial mass function (IMF) on predicted mass and spin magnitudes of BBH mergers from the AGN dynamical formation channel. By integrating the likelihood function for GW231123 with the detectable BBH population predicted from AGN using McFACTS, we demonstrate that GW231123 is consistent with a dynamical BBH merger from the AGN channel. We also postulate that the masses and spin magnitudes of GW231123 are most consistent with a merger of fourth and third generation BHs, for most choices of a segregated BH IMF and AGN lifetime.

**Comment:** Explores the formation of a binary black hole merger in the AGN channel, focusing on intermediate mass black holes and their spins. While it discusses black hole mergers in galactic nuclei, it does not address dwarf galaxies, star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13851

**Authors:** Mohit Singh Bisht, A. Raj, F. M. Walter, Anatoly S. Miroshnichenko, D. Bisht, K. Belwal, Shraddha Biswas

**Abstract:** We present a detailed spectrophotometric study of nova LMCN 2009-05a, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Photometric observations reveal a dust dip in the optical light curve, classifying it as a D-class nova. Light curve analysis yields t2 and t3 decline times of approximately 46 and 80 days, respectively, placing the nova in the category of moderately fast novae. Spectroscopic observations cover multiple phases, including pre-maximum, early decline, and nebular. The spectra are initially dominated by hydrogen Balmer and Fe II lines with P-Cygni profiles, which later transition into pure emission. During the optical minimum, a discrete absorption feature was observed in the H{\alpha} and [O I] line profiles. The physical and chemical properties during the early decline and nebular phases were analyzed using the photoionization code CLOUDY. Dust temperature, mass, and grain size were estimated through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to the WISE data. On day 395 post-outburst, we estimate the dust temperature to be approximately 700 K. Additionally, we examined the correlation between dust condensation time (tcond ) and t2 for LMC novae, finding a trend consistent with previous studies of Galactic novae.

**Comment:** Detailed study of a nova in the Large Magellanic Cloud, focusing on its dust properties and light curve. While the LMC is a nearby galaxy, the focus is on a single nova event, not on galaxy-scale star formation histories, dwarf galaxies, or galaxy simulations.

**Abstract:** In recent years, multiple Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been observed with "bumps" in their rising light curves shortly after explosion. Here, we present SN 2021qvo: a SN Ia that exhibits a clear early bump in photometry obtained by the Young Supernova Experiment. Photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2021qvo show that it has a broader light curve, higher peak luminosity, shallower Si II $\lambda$5972 pseudo-equivalent width, and lower ejecta velocities than normal SNe Ia, which are all consistent with the characteristics of the 2003fg-like (often called "super-Chandrasekhar") SN subtype. Including SN 2021qvo, just four known 2003fg-like SNe Ia have sufficient pre-peak data to reveal a rising light-curve bump, and all four have bump detections. Host-galaxy analysis reveals that SN 2021qvo exploded in a low-mass galaxy ${\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) = 7.83^{+0.17}_{-0.24}$, also consistent with other members of this class. We investigate the validity of the leading early-bump 2003fg-like SN Ia progenitor model, an interaction between the circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta, by modeling the early bump and subsequent light-curve evolution of SN 2021qvo with the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients. We find that the bump can be modeled with a best-fit CSM mass of $\log_{10}(M_\mathrm{CSM}/M_{\odot}) = -2.33^{+0.26}_{-0.15}$. SN 2021qvo adds to the small but growing number of 2003fg-like SNe Ia with rising light-curve bumps; as the number of these SNe Ia with CSM estimates continues to grow, population-level inferences about the CSM distribution will be able to constrain the progenitor scenario for these SNe Ia.

**Comment:** Reports on a Type Ia supernova with a rising light-curve bump in a low-mass host galaxy. While the host is low-mass, the focus is on supernova properties and circumstellar material, not on near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or dwarf galaxy evolution.

**Abstract:** We present the discovery of the unsubstituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) phenalene ($c$-C$_{13}$H$_{10}$) in TMC-1 as part of the QUIJOTE line survey. In spite of the low dipole moment of this three-ring PAH we have found a total of 267 rotational transitions with quantum numbers $J$ and $K_a$ up to 34 and 14, respectively, corresponding to 100 independent frequencies. The identification of this new PAH from our survey was based on the agreement between the rotational parameters derived from the analysis of the lines and those obtained by quantum chemical calculations. Subsequent chemical synthesis of this PAH and the investigation of its laboratory microwave spectrum unequivocally support our identification. The column density of phenalene in TMC-1 is (2.8$\pm$1.6)$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$.

## 27. [The Cosmic Dance: Observational Detection of Coherent Spin in Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13597) <a id="link27"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13597

**Authors:** Xiao-xiao Tang, Peng Wang, Yu Rong, Weiguang cui

**Abstract:** The spin of galaxy clusters encodes key information about their formation, dynamics, and the influence of large-scale structure. However, whether clusters possess statistically significant spin and how to measure it observationally remain open questions. Here, we present the first observational statistical detection of coherent spin in galaxy clusters, by using a sample of 2,170 systems with $M > 10^{14}\, M_\odot$ selected from a publicly available group catalog based on the SDSS galaxy. Cluster spin is quantified by identifying the orientation in the projected plane that maximizes the redshift difference ($\Delta Z_{\rm max}$) between member galaxies in two regions divided by a trial axis. We find strong statistical evidence for coherent rotation, with the observed $\Delta Z_{\rm max}$ distribution significantly exceeding randomized controls (nearly $\sim150\sigma$ confidence at $\sim380~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$), especially in richer clusters ($N_{\mathrm{gal}} > 10$, up to $\sim300\sigma$). Stacked visualizations confirm the spatial segregation of redshifted and blueshifted galaxies across the rotation axis. The radial profile of the rotational velocity indicates that it increases as a function of radius. The cluster rotation speed increases with mass, from $\sim330~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{14} M_\odot$ to $\sim800~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{15} M_\odot$. Additionally, cluster spin tends to align parallel with the central galaxy spin and perpendicular to the nearest cosmic filament, particularly in richer systems. These results reveal significant coherent spin in galaxy clusters, shaped by both internal dynamics and large-scale structure.

**Comment:** Studies the spin of galaxy clusters, which are much more massive than the galaxies of interest (dwarf galaxies, satellites). No connection to near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations at the relevant mass scale.

## 28. [Data Compression with Noise Suppression for Inference under Noisy Covariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14021) <a id="link28"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.14021

**Authors:** Sunao Sugiyama, Minsu Park

**Abstract:** In many fields including cosmology, statistical inference often relies on Gaussian likelihoods whose covariance matrices are estimated from a finite number of simulations. This finite-sample estimation introduces noise into the covariance, which propagates to parameter estimates, a phenomenon known as the Dodelson-Schneider (DS) effect, leading to inflated uncertainties. While the Massively Optimized Parameter Estimation and Data compression (MOPED) algorithm offers lossless Fisher information-preserving compression, it does not mitigate the DS effect when the compression matrix itself is derived from noisy covariances. In this paper, we propose a modified compression scheme, powered MOPED ($p$-MOPED), which suppresses noise propagation by balancing information retention and covariance estimate noise reduction through a tunable power-law transformation of the sample correlation matrix. We test $p$-MOPED against standard and diagonal MOPED on toy models and on cosmological data from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 3 weak lensing survey. Our results demonstrate that $p$-MOPED consistently outperforms other approaches, especially in regimes with limited simulations, offering a robust compression strategy for high-dimensional data analyses under practical constraints.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new data compression method for cosmological inference, tested on weak lensing survey data. It is methodological and does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, or star formation histories.

## 29. [Formation of methane and cyclohexane through the hydrogenation of toluene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13864) <a id="link29"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13864

**Authors:** A. T. Hopkinson, F. G. Doktor, J. Pitfield, M. Moll, J. D. Thrower, L. Hornek{\ae}r

**Abstract:** Methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been hypothesised to be present in the interstellar medium (ISM) through their 3.4 and 6.9 $\mu$m absorption bands. To investigate the hydrogenation of these methylated PAHs, the simplest, toluene ($\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_5}$), was exposed to H-atoms. This demonstrated how the presence of a methyl group changes the reactivity towards atomic hydrogen as compared to benzene and other PAHs and how this may alter its chemistry in the ISM. Toluene was deposited onto a graphite surface in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber and then exposed to a H-atom beam. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were used to investigate the reaction between H-atoms and toluene and the masses of hydrogenation products were measured with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). H-atom exposure of toluene leads to superhydrogenation of toluene and the formation of methyl-cyclohexane ($\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_{11}}$) at long exposure times. The initial cross-section of H-addition is lower than that of other PAHs. Methyl-cyclohexane can be further hydrogenated, leading to the detachment of the methyl group and production of cyclohexane ($\mathrm{C_6H_{12}}$) and methane ($\mathrm{CH_4}$). Toluene may be fully hydrogenated through its interaction with H-atoms, although it has a smaller initial cross-section for H-atom addition compared to other PAHs. This likely reflects it having a smaller geometric cross-section and the low flexibility of the benzene ring when undergoing sp$^3$ hybridization. The removal of the methyl group at high H-atom fluences provides a top down formation route to smaller molecules with the possibility of the formation of a radical cyclohexane combining with other species in an interstellar environment to form prebiotic molecules.

**Comment:** This paper investigates the hydrogenation of toluene and the formation of methane and cyclohexane, with implications for interstellar chemistry and prebiotic molecule formation. The focus is on molecular processes in the ISM, not on galaxy-scale simulations, star formation histories, or dwarf galaxy properties.

**Authors:** Yu-Chen Wang, Youhui Yun, Hong-Jian He, Yue Meng

**Abstract:** Direct detection of light dark matter (DM) is generally difficult due to its small recoil energy. The inelastic scattering of DM can produce unique signatures in the DM direct detection experiments. Using the low-energy unpaired ionization data from PandaX-4T, we newly analyze the probe of the exothermic inelastic dark matter (ineDM). We demonstrate that PandaX-4T can probe the ineDM mass-splitting down to 0.05 keV and probe the ineDM mass to the sub-GeV range. For the ineDM with a dark photon mediator, we use the PandaX-4T data to impose stringent bounds on the mixing parameter between the dark photon and photon.

**Abstract:** We present results from an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive binary black holes using the third data release (DR3) of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA). Even though we recover a common-spectrum stochastic process, potentially induced by a nanohertz gravitational wave background, we find no evidence of continuous waves. Therefore, we place upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude: in the most sensitive frequency range around 10 nHz, we obtain a sky-averaged 95\% credibility upper limit of $\approx 7 \times 10^{-15}$. Our search is sensitive to supermassive binary black holes with a chirp mass of $\geq 10^9M_{\odot}$ up to a luminosity distance of 50 Mpc for our least sensitive sky direction and 200 Mpc for the most sensitive direction. This work provides at least 4 times better sensitivity in the 1-200 nHz frequency band than our last search based on the PPTA's first data release. We expect that PPTA will continue to play a key role in detecting continuous gravitational waves in the exciting era of nanohertz gravitational wave astronomy.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13279

**Authors:** John Ellis, Marcos A. G. Garcia, Natsumi Nagata, Dimitri V. Nanopoulos, Keith A. Olive

**Abstract:** The original Starobinsky $R + R^2$ model of inflation is consistent with Planck and other measurements of the CMB, but recent results from the ACT and SPT Collaborations hint that the tilt of scalar perturbations may be in tension with the prediction of the Starobinsky model. No-scale models of inflation can reproduce the predictions of the Starobinsky model, but also provide a framework for incorporating deformations that could accommodate more easily the ACT and SPT data. We discuss this possibility in the contexts of SU(5) GUTs, taking into account the constraints on these models imposed by the longevity of the proton, the cold dark matter density and the measured value of the Higgs boson. We find that SU(5) with a CMSSM-like pattern of soft supersymmetry breaking has difficulty in accommodating all the constraints, whereas SU(5) with pure gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking can accommodate them easily. We also consider two SO(10) symmetry-breaking patterns that can accommodate the ACT and SPT data. In both the SU(5) and SO(10) models, the deformations avoid issues associated with large initial field values in the Starobinsky model: in particular, the total number of e-folds is largely independent of the initial conditions.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13667

**Authors:** Kun Fang

**Abstract:** $\gamma$-ray pulsar halos, formed by inverse Compton scattering of electrons and positrons propagating in the pulsar-surrounding interstellar medium with background photons, serve as an ideal probe for Galactic cosmic-ray propagation on small scales (typically tens of parsecs). While the associated electron and positron propagation is often modeled using homogeneous and isotropic diffusion, termed here as normal diffusion, the actual transport process is expected to be more complex. This work introduces the Pulsar Halo Emission Computation Tool (PHECT), a lightweight software designed for modeling pulsar halo emission. PHECT incorporates multiple transport models extending beyond normal diffusion, accounting for different possible origins of pulsar halos. Users can conduct necessary computations simply by configuring a YAML file without manual code edits. Furthermore, the tool adopts finite-volume discretizations that remain stable on non-uniform grids and in the presence of discontinuous coefficients. PHECT is ready for the increasingly precise observational data and the rapidly growing sample of pulsar halos.

**Comment:** Describes a computational tool for modeling gamma-ray pulsar halos. While relevant for cosmic-ray propagation, it does not address galaxy evolution, dwarf galaxies, or other core topics.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13273

**Authors:** Roberto D. Alba Q., Javier Chagoya, Armando A. Roque

**Abstract:** We investigate static, spherically symmetric solutions in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity non-minimally coupled to a massless real scalar field, both in vacuum and in the presence of fermionic matter. Focusing on a specific quadratic scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling, we identify two distinct classes of compact objects: one with a regular scalar field at the origin -- connected to general relativity in an appropriate limit -- and another {one} with a divergent scalar field at the origin but a regular geometry. We analyze both purely scalar and matter-supported (hybrid) configurations, showing that the former can describe a broad class of compact objects, while the latter can reproduce neutron star-like masses even when modeled with a simple polytropic equation of state. Furthermore, we highlight distinctive phenomenological signatures, including the ability of these stars to exceed known compactness limits and their potential to act as gravitational wave super-emitters. We also examined the motion of test particles non-minimally coupled to the scalar field and showed the existence of stable circular orbits within the Schwarzschild's ISCO and static configurations at finite radii for particles with zero angular momentum.

**Comment:** Focuses on compact stars in modified gravity, specifically neutron star-like objects. While neutron stars are not dwarf galaxies and the work is not about galaxy simulations or star formation histories, it does touch on stellar models (though for exotic stars). However, it does not present new stellar evolutionary or atmosphere models relevant to the criteria. No direct match to any core topic.

**Authors:** Christopher Neal Everett, Garret Cotter

**Abstract:** DIPLODOCUS (Distribution-In-PLateaux methODOlogy for the CompUtation of transport equationS) is a novel framework being developed for the mesoscopic modelling of astrophysical systems via the transport of particle distribution functions through the seven dimensions of phase space, including continuous forces and discrete interactions between particles. This first paper in a series provides an overview of the analytical framework behind the model, consisting of an integral formulation of the relativistic transport equations (Boltzmann equations) and a discretisation procedure for the particle distribution function (Distribution-In-Plateaux). The latter allows for the evaluation of anisotropic interactions, and generates a conservative numerical scheme for a distribution function's transport through phase space.

**Authors:** Elena Manjavacas, Mario Gennaro, Sarah Betti, Laurent Pueyo, William Balmer, Massimo Robberto

**Abstract:** Age-benchmark brown dwarfs' and planetary-mass objects' spectroscopy is key to characterize substellar evolution. In this paper we present the JHK medium resolution (R~3000) spectra of 25 7-75 M_Jup (spectral types L3.0-M6.0) brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster obtained with MOSFIRE installed at the W. M. Keck I telescope. We obtained the spectral types of the targets in our sample using template brown dwarf and planetary-mass objects' spectra. We confirmed their extreme youth (<5 Myr) and membership to the cluster using spectral indices, and the diversity of their spectra even for targets with similar spectral types. Six of our targets presented Pa-beta and Bra-gamma emission lines, suggesting the existence of accreting protoplanetary disks to objects with masses as low as 7 M_Jup. After analyzing the emission lines of those objects, and measuring their accretion rates, we compared them to those of stars, brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects, confirming that planetary-mass young objects deplete their disks quickly at young ages. Finally, we illustrate the spectral evolution of a 7-10 M_Jup planetary-mass object through its life from 1-3 Myr to 200 Myr old using one of our latest spectra type targets, and other targets from the literature with older age, but similar estimated masses. The spectra are publicly available for the community's use as data behind the figures.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13448

**Authors:** Jian Zhang, Bao-Cheng Qin, Lu-Lu Zhang, Fu-Wen Zhang

**Abstract:** The initial Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_{0}$) and jet half-opening angle ($\theta_{\rm jet}$) of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are critical physical parameters for understanding the dynamical evolution of relativistic jets and the true energy release of GRBs. We compile a sample of 89 GRBs that exhibit an onset bump feature in their early optical or GeV light curves, 42 of which also display a jet break feature, and derive their $\Gamma_{0}$ and $\theta_{\rm jet}$ values. Using this sample, we re-eaxmine the correlations between $\Gamma_{0}$ and the prompt emission parameters (isotropic energy $E_{\rm iso}$, peak luminosity $L_{\rm iso}$, and peak energy $E_{\rm p}$). Our results confirm the previously reported $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$E_{\rm iso}$ ($L_{\rm iso}$), $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$E_{\rm p,z}$, and $E_{\rm iso}$ ($L_{\rm iso}$)$-$$E_{\rm p}$$-$$\Gamma_{0}$ relations for both homogeneous interstellar medium (ISM) and wind density profiles (Wind). Notably, we find that the short GRB 090510 complies with the $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$E_{\rm iso}$ relation, but significantly deviates from the $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$L_{\rm iso}$ and $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$E_{\rm p,z}$ relations. We systematically investigate the influence of $\theta_{\rm jet}$ on $\Gamma_{0}$ and find a weak dependence. Additionally, we report, for the first time, three new three-parameter correlations, i.e., $E_{\rm iso}$ (or $L_{\rm iso}$, $E_{\rm p,z}$)$-$$\Gamma_{0}$$-$$\theta_{\rm jet}$ correlations. In addition, we further explore the relations between the initial Lorentz factor and the jet-corrected energy. We also find that the jet-corrected correlations remain significant, suggesting that these relations are intrinsic to the physical nature of GRBs. However, the increased dispersion after correction implies that underlying differences persist among individual GRBs.

**Comment:** The paper analyzes gamma-ray burst jet properties and their correlations. While it is astrophysical, it does not address any of the core topics such as dwarf galaxies, star formation histories, quenching, or galaxy simulations.

## 38. [Prospects for Deep-Learning-Based Mass Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays using Simulated Air-Shower Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13933) <a id="link38"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13933

**Authors:** Zhouyi Wang, Eric Mayotte, Sonja Mayotte, Nathan Woo, Julia Burton-Heibges, Nicolas San Martin, Cailyn Smith

**Abstract:** Knowledge of the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) is crucial to understanding their origins; however, current approaches have limited event-by-event resolution due to high intrinsic fluctuations of variables like $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $N_\mu$. With fluorescence telescope measurements of $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ in particular, there are opportunities to improve this situation by leveraging more information from the longitudinal shower development profile beyond just the depth at which its maximum occurs. Although there have been ML studies on extracting composition or mass groups from surface signals, parametrized profiles, or from derived parameters (e.g. $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ distributions), to our knowledge, we present the first study of a deep-learning neural-network approach to directly predict a primary's mass ($\ln A$) from the full longitudinal energy-deposit profile of simulated extensive air showers. We train and validate our model on a large suite of simulated showers, generated with CONEX and EPOS-LHC, covering nuclei from $A = 1$ to $61$, sampled uniformly in $\ln A$. After rescaling, our network achieves a maximum bias better than 0.4 in $\ln A$ on unseen test showers with a resolution ranging between 1.5 for protons and 1 for iron over a large range of noise conditions, corresponding to a proton-iron merit factor of 2.19, outperforming the predictive power of either $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ or $N_\mu$ alone. This performance is only mildly degraded when predictions are made on simulations using the Sibyll-2.3d hadronic interaction model, which was not used in training, showing these features are robust against model choice. Our results suggest that the full shower profile may contain latent composition-sensitive features which have as much discriminating power as $X_{\mathrm{max}}$.

**Comment:** Focuses on deep learning for mass reconstruction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays using air-shower profiles. This is unrelated to galaxies, star formation, or stellar models.

## 39. [A comprehensive spectroscopic reference of the solar system and its application to exoplanet direct imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13368) <a id="link39"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13368

**Authors:** Allison Payne, Geronimo L. Villanueva, Vincent Kofman, Thomas J. Fauchez, Sara Faggi, Avi M. Mandell, Aki Roberge, Eleonora Alei

**Abstract:** We present a calibrated database of reflectance spectra for the solar system planets (i.e., Mercury, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) and for Titan, spanning from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. We considered data collected over 60 years of planetary observations, employing a broad range of geometries and facilities (spacecraft and ground-based observatories). To correct for differences in observational geometries and data quality, we adopted a two-step calibration process that standardized each spectrum to the planet's geometric albedo values and corrected for planetary heterogeneity and calibration effects. The calibrated datasets were then combined across wavelengths, leading to a reference composite reflectance spectrum for each planet. As a test of this spectral library for exoplanetary research, we simulated direct imaging observations of the Proxima Centauri and HD 219134 systems as solar system analogs, as well as the solar system at a distance of 10 parsecs. We also explored the detection limitations of direct imaging instruments imposed by the inner and outer working angles for Earth and Jupiter-like exoplanets as a function of system distance. Additionally, we used the visible light portion of the results to produce realistic color reconstructions of each planet. Standardizing reflectance spectra in this work improves our baseline for interpreting new reflected light observations of exoplanets through comparative planetology. This spectral library can then serve as a calibrated and validated reference in the modeling and preparation for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with future direct imaging missions and for astronomical studies of the solar system.

**Comment:** Presents a calibrated database of reflectance spectra for solar system planets and applies it to exoplanet direct imaging. No connection to galaxy science, star formation, or stellar models as defined in the criteria.

## 40. [MaxWave: Rapid Maximum Likelihood Wavelet Reconstruction of Non-Gaussian features in Gravitational Wave Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13377) <a id="link40"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13377

**Authors:** Sudhi Mathur, Neil J. Cornish

**Abstract:** Advancements in the sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors have increased the detection rate of transient astrophysical signals. We improve the existing BayesWave initialization algorithm and present a rapid, low-latency approximate maximum likelihood solution for reconstructing non-Gaussian features. We include three enhancements: (1) using a modified wavelet basis to eliminate redundant inner product calculations; (2) shifting from traditional time-frequency-quality factor (TFQ) wavelet transforms to time-frequency-time extent (TF$\tau$) transforms to optimize wavelet subtractions; and (3) implementing a downsampled heterodyned wavelet transform to accelerate initial calculations. Our model can be used to de-noise long-duration signals, which include the stochastic gravitational-wave background from numerous unresolved sources and continuous wave signals from isolated sources such as rotating neutron stars. Through our model, we can also aid machine learning applications that aim to classify and understand glitches by providing non-whitened, time and frequency domain, Gaussian-noise-free reconstructions of any glitch.

**Comment:** Presents a new method for reconstructing non-Gaussian features in gravitational wave data. Not related to galaxy simulations, star formation, or stellar models.

## 41. [A $\tau$-$DM relation for FRB hosts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13317) <a id="link41"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13317

**Authors:** Lluis Mas-Ribas, Clancy W. James

**Abstract:** It has been proposed that measurements of scattering times ($\tau$) from fast radio bursts (FRB) may be used to infer the FRB host dispersion measure (DM) and its redshift. This approach relies on the existence of a correlation between $\tau$ and DM within FRB hosts such as that observed for Galactic pulsars. We assess the measurability of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation through simulated observations of FRBs within the ASKAP/CRAFT survey, taking into account instrumental effects. We show that even when the FRB hosts intrinsically follow the $\tau - $DM relation measured for pulsars, this correlation cannot be inferred from FRB observations; this limitation arises mostly from the large variance around the average cosmic DM value given by the Macquart relation, the variance within the $\tau - $DM relation itself, and observational biases against large $\tau$ values. We argue that theoretical relations have little utility as priors on redshift, e.g., for purposes of galaxy identification, and that the recent lack of an observed correlation between scattering and DM in the ASKAP/CRAFT survey is not unexpected, even if our understanding of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation is correct.

**Comment:** This paper focuses on the relationship between scattering times and dispersion measures in FRB hosts, which is not directly related to any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations. The focus is on FRB host properties and observational biases, not on dwarf galaxies or their environments.

**Abstract:** MRC 0600-399, in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 3376, is one of the unique Head-Tail radio galaxies having abruptly bending structures, the origin of which is still under discussion. A previous study suggested that the interaction between the jets and the magnetic fields on the cold front has produced such an outstanding feature; however, it is still not known how the jet propagates the long distance keeping the sharp shape. In this study, we performed a polarization analysis of MRC 0600-399 and a nearby radio source using MeerKAT L-band data. To interpret the Faraday structure, we constructed the Pseudo-3D visualization map of the reconstructed Faraday dispersion function 3D cube. MRC 0600-399 has a complicated Faraday depth structure, and some of the Faraday depth features are in good agreement with the 2D structure on the celestial sphere. For the northern jet of MRC 0600-399, the Faraday depth values show a clear gap at the tip region. Based on the polarization analysis and comparison with the other observation, we concluded that the synchrotron radiation from the tip region of the northern jet originates from the magnetic field on the cold front.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13682

**Abstract:** Broad absorption line (BAL) quasars are often considered X-ray weak relative to their optical/UV luminosity, whether intrinsically (i.e., the coronal emission is fainter) or due to large column densities of absorbing material. The SDSS-V is providing optical spectroscopy for samples of quasar candidates identified by eROSITA as well as Chandra, XMM or Swift, making the resulting datasets ideal for characterising the BAL quasar population within an X-ray selected sample. We use the Balnicity Index (BI) to identify the BAL quasars based on absorption of the CIV $\lambda\,1549$ emission line in the optical spectra, finding 143 BAL quasars in our sample of 2317 X-ray selected quasars within $1.5\le z \le3.5$. This observed BAL fraction of $\approx$ 6 per cent is comparable to that found in optically selected samples. We also identify absorption systems via the Absorption Index (AI) which includes mini-BALs and NALs, finding 954 quasars with AI $>0$. We consider the CIV emission space (equivalent width vs. blueshift) to study the BAL outflows within the context of the radiatively driven accretion disc-wind model. X-ray selection excludes the highest outflow velocities in emission but includes the full range of absorption velocities which we suggest is consistent with the BAL gas being located further from the X-ray corona than the emitting gas. We observe both X-ray weak and X-ray strong BALs (via the optical-to-X-ray spectral slope, $\alpha_\text{ox}$) and detect little evidence for differing column densities between the BAL and non-BAL quasars, suggesting the BALs and non-BALs have the same shielding gas and intrinsic X-ray emission.

## 44. [Fractality of open clusters in singles, pairs, and groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13980) <a id="link44"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13980

**Authors:** Almat Akhmetali

**Abstract:** In this work, we investigate the global structural properties and fractality of 1,876 open clusters (OCs) in different environments, including 1,145 singles, 392 pairs, and 339 groups. We analyze cluster mass, age, size, concentration, and fractal structure using the Q parameter and the fractal dimension fdim, and examine their correlations with key physical parameters. Our results reveal systematic environmental trends: clusters in groups are generally younger, less massive, slightly larger, and less centrally concentrated than those in pairs or singles. Fractality is more pronounced in clusters within pairs and groups, with 44% of group clusters exhibiting fractal substructure compared to 38.5% for pairs and 33.2% for singles. Similarly, median fdim values increase from singles (1.13) to pairs (1.16) to groups (1.25), reflecting greater substructure in denser environments. These findings indicate that both intrinsic cluster properties and environmental context significantly influence cluster evolution. More massive clusters tend to evolve toward centrally concentrated, radially symmetric configurations, while less massive clusters retain fractal features for longer periods. Overall, our study demonstrates that open clusters do not evolve in isolation: interactions with the environment play a critical role in shaping their structural evolution and dynamical state.

**Comment:** Studies the fractal structure of open clusters in different environments. Focus is on star clusters, not galaxies or dwarf galaxies, and does not address star formation histories or quenching in galaxies.

## 45. [Learning to Estimate Photospheric Vector Fields from Line-of-Sight Magnetograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13929) <a id="link45"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13929

**Authors:** David Fouhey, KD Leka

**Abstract:** Solar photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms are easier to estimate than full vector magnetograms since the line-of-sight component (Blos) can be obtained from total intensity and circular polarization signals, unlike the perpendicular component (Bperp), which depends on harder-to-measure linear polarization. Unfortunately, the line of sight component by itself is not physically meaningful, as it is just one component of the underlying vector and one whose relationship to gravity changes pixel-to-pixel. To produce an estimate of the radial component (Br) a common ``correction'' is often applied that assumes the field is radial, which is nearly always false. This paper investigates recovering full vector field information from Blos by building on the recent SuperSynthIA approach that was originally used with Stokes vectors as input for simultaneous inversion and disambiguation. As input, the method accepts one or more line-of-sight magnetograms and associated metadata; as output, our method estimates full vector field in heliographic components, meaning that the physically-relevant vector components are returned without need for further disambiguation steps or component transforms. We demonstrate the ability to produce good estimates of the full vector field on unseen examples from both HMI and GONG, including examples that predate the Solar Dynamics Observatory mission. Our results show that learning is not a replacement for a dedicated vector-field observing facilities, but may serve to unlock information from past data and at the very least, provide more accurate Br maps from Blos than are created using the simple viewing angle assumption.

**Comment:** This paper presents a machine learning approach to estimate solar photospheric vector fields from line-of-sight magnetograms. It is focused on solar physics and does not address any of the core topics such as galaxy simulations, star formation histories, or dwarf galaxy properties.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13341

**Authors:** Mohsen Fathi

**Abstract:** In this work, we investigate the shadow properties of the Kerr-Newman-Anti-de Sitter black hole coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics. We construct the shadow by employing the celestial coordinate approach for observers located at finite distances, accounting for the non-asymptotically flat nature of the spacetime. The size, distortion, area, and oblateness of the shadow are analyzed in terms of the black hole parameters, including the spin, effective charge, and nonlinearity parameter. We further explore observational constraints using the Event Horizon Telescope results for M87* and Sgr~A*. The angular diameters inferred from the observed images allow us to bound the parameter space of the model, showing that both spin and nonlinearity play key roles in shaping the shadow and in restricting the effective charge. Additionally, we examine the energy emission rate derived from the shadow radius and Hawking temperature, highlighting the influence of rotation and nonlinear electrodynamics on black hole evaporation. Our results demonstrate that the black hole model provides a physically consistent and observationally viable extension of the standard Kerr paradigm, with potential implications for near-horizon quantum processes and tests of gravity beyond general relativity.

**Comment:** The paper studies the shadow properties of a generalized Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole with nonlinear electrodynamics, focusing on black hole physics and observational constraints.

## 47. [VIPCALs: A fully-automated calibration pipeline for VLBI data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13282) <a id="link47"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13282

**Authors:** Diego \'Alvarez-Ortega, Carolina Casadio, Felix M. P\"otzl, Avinash Kumar, Michael Janssen

**Abstract:** Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is a powerful technique that can achieve sub-milliarcsecond resolution. However, it requires complex and often manual post-correlation calibration to correct for instrumental, geometric, and propagation-related errors. Unlike connected-element interferometers, VLBI arrays typically provide raw visibilities rather than science-ready data, and existing pipelines are largely semi-automated and reliant on user supervision. We present VIPCALs, a fully automated, end-to-end calibration pipeline for continuum VLBI data that operates without human intervention or prior knowledge of the dataset. Designed for scalability to thousands of sources and heterogeneous archival observations, VIPCALs addresses the needs of initiatives such as the Search for Milli-Lenses (SMILE) project. Implemented in Python using ParselTongue, VIPCALs reproduces the standard AIPS calibration workflow in a fully unsupervised mode. Besides the usual calibration tasks, the pipeline also performs automatic reference antenna selection, calibrator identification, and generates diagnostic outputs for inspection. We validated it on a representative sample of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data corresponding to 1 000 sources from the SMILE project. VIPCALs successfully calibrated observations of 955 of the test sources across multiple frequency bands. Over 91% of the calibrated datasets achieved successful fringe fitting on target in at least half of the solutions attempted. The median ratio of calibrated visibilities to initial total visibilities was 0.87. The average processing time was below 10 minutes per dataset, demonstrating both efficiency and scalability. VIPCALs enables robust, reproducible, and fully automated calibration of VLBI continuum data, significantly lowering the entry barrier for VLBI science and making large-scale projects like SMILE feasible.

**Abstract:** The physical origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains uncertain. Although multiwavelength observations offer critical diagnostics and have been widely conducted, only Galactic FRB~20200428D is associated with an X-ray burst from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154. Here, we present multiwavelength follow-up observations of the nearby bright FRB~20250316A, including the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), Einstein Probe (EP) X-ray mission, Chandra X-ray Observatory, Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) and Space Variable Object Monitor/Visible Telescope (SVOM/VT). A 13.08-hour FAST follow-up observational campaign suggests that this burst is likely a one-off event. A prompt EP follow-up and multi-epoch observational campaign totaling $>$ 100 ks led to the detection of an X-ray source within the angular resolution of its Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT, $10^{\prime\prime}$). A subsequent Chandra observation revealed this source to be offset by $7^{\prime\prime}$ from the FRB position, and established a 0.5-10 keV flux upper limit of $7.6\times 10^{-15}$ $\rm erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ at the FRB position, corresponding to $\sim 10^{39}$ $\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ at the 40 Mpc distance of the host galaxy NGC~4141. These results set one of the most stringent limits on X-ray emission from a non-repeating FRB, disfavoring ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) as counterparts of apparently one-off FRBs and offering critical insights into afterglow models. Our study suggests that an arcsecond localization of both the FRB and its potential X-ray counterpart is essential for exploring the X-ray counterpart of an FRB.

## 50. [Hyperactive Magnetar Eruptions: Giant Flares, Baryon Ejections, and FRBs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13419) <a id="link50"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13419

**Authors:** Ashley Bransgrove, Andrei M. Beloborodov, Yuri Levin

**Abstract:** Young neutron stars born with magnetic fields $B\gtrsim 10^{16}$ G become hyperactive as the field inside the star evolves through ambipolar diffusion on a timescale $\sim 10^9$ s. We simulate this process numerically and find that it can eject magnetic loops from the star. The internal magnetic field first diffuses to the crust surrounding the liquid core and then erupts from the surface, taking a significant amount of crustal material with it. The eruption involves magnetic reconnection, generating a giant gamma-ray flare. A significant fraction of the eruption energy is carried by the neutron-rich crustal material, which must go through a phase of decompression and nuclear heating. The massive ejecta should produce additional emission components after the giant flare, including radioactively powered gamma-rays, optical emission, and much later a radio afterglow. The predicted eruptions may rarely happen in observed magnetars in our galaxy, which are relatively old and rarely produce giant flares. The model can, however, explain the extremely powerful flare from SGR 1806-20 in December 2004, its ejecta mass, and afterglow. More active, younger magnetars may produce frequent crustal eruptions and form unusual nebulae. Such hyperactive magnetars are candidates for the central engines of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs). We argue that each eruption launches an ultrarelativistic magnetosonic pulse leading the ejecta and steepening into a relativistic shock capable of emitting an FRB.

**Comment:** This paper discusses magnetar eruptions, giant flares, and FRBs, focusing on neutron stars and their magnetic activity. It does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

**Abstract:** The vertical (Lense-Thirring) precession of the innermost accretion flows has been discussed as a sensitive indicator of the rotational properties of neutron stars (NSs) and their equation of state because it vanishes for a non-rotating star. In this work, we apply the Hartle-Thorne spacetimes to study the frequencies of the precession for both geodesic and non-geodesic (fluid) flows. We build on previous findings on the effect of the NS quadrupole moment, which revealed the importance of the interplay between the relativistic and classical precession. Because of this interplay, the widely used Lense-Thirring metric, linear in the NS angular momentum, is insufficient to calculate the behaviour of the precession frequency across an astrophysically relevant range of NS angular momentum values. We find that even for a moderately oblate NSs, the dependencies of the precession frequency on the NS angular momentum at radii within the innermost accretion region have maxima that occur at relatively low values of the NS angular momentum. We conclude that very different groups of accreting NSs, slow and fast rotators, can display the same precession frequencies. This may explain the lack of evidence for a correlation between the frequencies of the observed low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations and the NS spin. In our work, we provide a full, general description of precession behaviour, and also examples that assume specific NS and quark star (MIT bag) equation of state. Our calculations are reproducible using the associated Wolfram Mathematica notebook.

**Comment:** Focuses on Lense-Thirring precession in accretion flows around neutron stars. This is not related to any of the core topics such as galaxy simulations, star formation, or stellar models (in the sense of evolutionary or atmosphere models).

**Abstract:** This study presents an X-ray spectropolarimetric characterisation of the Z-source GX 340+0 during the normal branch (NB) and compares it with that obtained for the horizontal branch (HB), using IXPE, NICER and NuSTAR observations. The analysis reveals significant polarisation, with polarisation degrees (PD) of ${\sim}1.4$\% in the NB and ${\sim}3.7$\% in the HB, indicating a notable decrease in polarisation when transitioning from the HB to the NB. The polarisation angles show a consistent trend across the states. Spectropolarimetric analysis favours a dependence of the polarisation on the energy. The Comptonised component shows similar polarisation in both the HB and NB and is higher than the theoretical expectation for a boundary or spreading layer. This suggests a contribution from the wind or the presence of an extended accretion disc corona (ADC) to enhance the polarisation. The results obtained here highlight the importance of using polarimetric data to better understand the accretion mechanisms and the geometry of this class of sources, providing insights into the nature of the accretion flow and the interplay between different spectral components. Overall, the findings advance our understanding of the physical processes governing accretion in low-mass X-ray binaries.

**Abstract:** Intermediate-mass galaxies, including the Milky Way, typically host both a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a nuclear stellar cluster (NSC). Binaries in an NSC evolve via close encounters with surrounding stars and secular processes related to the SMBH. We study moderately soft and hard binaries ($0.03$-$2.5\,\mathrm{au}$, $M \lesssim 2\,M_\odot$) initially at galactocentric radii 0.1 and 0.3 pc using three-body simulations including von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations and tidal dissipation over $\sim 10$ Gyr. Binaries migrate both inward and outward as a consequence of kicks received in the three-body encounters. Inward migration leads to destruction via mergers and evaporation, while outward migration is a pathway to retaining intact binaries for $\gtrsim 10$ Gyr. All surviving binaries are hard and circular, but outcomes for binaries initially at the hard-soft boundary are stochastic. We find that: (i) about $0.3$ percent of evaporated binaries fall into the SMBH's loss cone, (ii) at least $1$ percent of mergers occur late enough to appear as blue straggler stars (BSSs) on the main sequence or as recently evolved red giants, (iii) about $1$ percent of binaries initially at 0.1 pc merge within the inner arcsec of the NSC, and (iv) less than about $80$ percent of field-star collisions with a binary star lead to a subsequent merger; a three-body pile up, which are relatively common in the first 1-2 Gyr and could serve as a way to form more massive BSSs in the NSC. We predict that a small fraction of binaries originate closer to the SMBH than their present-day orbits, and vice versa for evaporated binaries and BSSs. The mergers confined to the inner arcsec occur after $\gtrsim 300$ Myr, too long to be directly related to the formation of the S-stars or G-objects, but suggest that the inner arcsec is contaminated with BSSs from earlier star formation events.

**Comment:** This paper studies binary stars in the Milky Way nuclear stellar cluster, focusing on their evolution near the supermassive black hole. It is focused on the Galactic center and nuclear cluster, which is explicitly listed as irrelevant in the criteria.

**Abstract:** The carrier of the 21 ${\mu}$m emission feature discovered in a handful of protoplanetary nebulae (PPNe) is one of the most intriguing enigmas in circumstellar chemistry. Investigating the gas-phase molecules in PPNe could yield important hints for understanding the 21 ${\mu}$m feature. In this paper, we report observations of the CS $J = 5 \to 4$ line at 245 GHz and the CO $J = 1 \to 0$ line at 115 GHz toward seven PPNe exhibiting the 21 ${\mu}$m feature. We find that CS is extremely scarce in these PPNe and the CS line is only detected in one source, IRAS Z02229+6208. Based on the assumption of local thermal equilibrium and negligible optical depth, we derive that the CS column densities and fractional abundances relative to H$_{2}$ are $N$(CS) < 9.1 ${\times}$ 10$^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ and $f$(CS) < 8.1 ${\times}$ 10$^{-7}$. A comparison of the CS abundances across different circumstellar envelopes reveals that the variations in CS abundance are complex, depending not only on the evolutionary stages but also on the properties of individual objects.

## 55. [Hunting for new glitches in LIGO data using community science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13923) <a id="link55"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13923

**Authors:** E Mackenzie, C P L Berry, G Niklasch, B T\'egl\'as, C Unsworth, K Crowston, D Davis, A K Katsaggelos

**Abstract:** Data from ground-based gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO contain many types of noise. Glitches are short bursts of non-Gaussian noise that may hinder our ability to identify or analyse gravitational-wave signals. They may have instrumental or environmental origins, and new types of glitches may appear following detector changes. The Gravity Spy project studies glitches and their origins, combining insights from volunteers on the community-science Zooniverse platform with machine learning. Here, we study volunteer proposals for new glitch classes, discussing links between these glitches and the state of the detectors, and examining how new glitch classes pose a challenge for machine-learning classification. Our results demonstrate how Zooniverse empowers non-experts to make discoveries, and the importance of monitoring changes in data quality in the LIGO detectors.

**Comment:** This paper discusses glitch identification in LIGO data using community science and machine learning. It is focused on gravitational wave detector noise and does not address any of the core topics such as galaxy simulations, star formation, or dwarf galaxy properties.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13844

**Authors:** Merlin Kole, Kasun Wimalasena, Richard Gorby, Torsten Diesel, Zachary Greenberg, Fabian Kislat

**Abstract:** The last years have seen the first cryogenic detectors to be proposed for usage on balloon-borne missions. In such missions, the instrument will be exposed to the high radiation environment of the upper atmosphere. This radiation can induce a significant background to the measurements, something which can be mitigated through the use of an anti-coincidence shield. For hard X-ray and gamma-ray detectors such a shield typically consists photomultiplier tubes or, more recently, silicon photomultipliers coupled to scintillators placed around the detector. When using cryogenic detectors, the shield can be placed around the entire cryostat which will make it large, heavy and expensive. For the ASCENT (A SuperConducting ENergetic x-ray Telescope) mission, which uses Transition Edge Detectors, it was therefore considered to instead place the shield inside. This comes with the challenge of operating it at cryogenic temperatures. For this purpose, we tested the performance of 2 different types of GAGG:Ce scintillators down to 15 mK for the first time. Although significant variations of both the decay time and the light yield were found when varying the temperature, at 4 K its performance was found to be similar to that at room temperature. Furthermore, unexpected behavior around 2 K was found for both types of GAGG:Ce, leading to more in depth studies around these temperatures. Overall, the studies show that the combination of materials will allow to produce a functional anti-coincidence shield at several Kelvin.

## 57. [Detecting False Positives With Derived Planetary Parameters: Experimenting with the KEPLER Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13801) <a id="link57"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13801

**Authors:** Ayan Bin Rafaih, Zachary Murray

**Abstract:** Recent developments in computational power and machine learning techniques motivate their use in many different astrophysical research areas. Consequently, many machine learning models have been trained to classify exoplanet transit signals - typically done by using time series light curves. In this work, we attempt a different approach and try to improve the efficiency of these algorithms by fitting only derived planetary parameters, instead of full time-series light curves. We investigate and evaluate 4 models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks) on the KEPLER dataset, using precision-recall trade-off and accuracy metrics. We show that this approach can identify up to about 90% of false positives, implying the planetary parameters encompass most of the relevant information contained in a light curve. Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Networks produce the highest accuracy and the best precision-recall trade-off. We also note that the accuracies as a function of the stellar eclipse flag SS have the best performance.

## 58. [Is Phantom Barrier Crossing Inevitable? A Cosmographic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13740) <a id="link58"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13740

**Authors:** Nandan Roy, Soumya Chakrabarti

**Abstract:** We investigate the evolution of dark energy using a model-independent framework based on the cosmographic approach. The main objective of this work is to construct a dynamical dark energy model directly from the kinematic equations of the cosmographic parameters, rather than adopting any arbitrary parametrization of the cosmological parameters. We employ the differential equation for the jerk parameter and map it to an anharmonic oscillator equation. From this, we derive an analytical expression for the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy. Interestingly, this form of the EoS depends on only a single parameter. Using the recently released DESI DR2 BAO data, Pantheon+ supernova dataset, and a compressed Planck likelihood, we constrain the cosmological parameters within this framework. Our results indicate a deviation from the cosmological constant behavior at late times, suggesting a dynamical nature of dark energy. Our findings contradict the DESI DR2 analysis based on the CPL parametrization, as no phantom-barrier crossing is observed in our analysis. This study highlights that model-independent reconstructions rooted in kinematical quantities can provide robust insights into the true nature of dark energy.

## 59. [Effects of Dissipation Physics on High-frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillations in Black Hole X-ray Binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13508) <a id="link59"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13508

**Authors:** Theodore Dezen, Sergio Gomez, Kathryn Anawalt

**Abstract:** We numerically investigate the effects of black hole spin and local dissipation profiles on high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) observed in black hole X-ray binaries (BHXB). Our HFQPO power spectra arise from self-consistent calculations that do not rely on ad-hoc assumptions regarding disk geometry. Our models combine radiative transfer and disk vertical structure equations with input motivated by first-principles three-dimensional simulations. We found that HFQPO power spectra may be sensitive to spatial distribution of dissipation rates while the quality factors are more sensitive to black hole spin. We discuss the observational implications of our results in context of steep power law (SPL) spectra from BHXBs that are seen together with HFQPOs, and how QPO properties may be indicators of the underlying physical oscillations.

## 60. [High-Resolution Observation of Solar Prominence Plumes Induced by Enhanced Spicular Activity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13456) <a id="link60"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13456

**Authors:** Wensi Wang, Rui Liu, Runbin Luo, Xiaoli Yan

**Abstract:** Solar prominences are the most prominent large-scale structures observed above the solar limb in emission in chromospheric lines but in absorption in coronal lines. At the bottom of prominences often appears a bubble, with plumes occasionally rising from the prominence-bubble interface. The plumes may potentially play an important role in the mass supply and thermodynamic evolution of prominences, but their nature and generation mechanism are elusive. Here we use the high-resolution H-alpha observations obtained by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) to investigate a quiescent prominence with bubbles and plumes on 8 November 2022. Within an interval of about two hours, enhanced spicular activity disturb the prominence-bubble interface, producing bursts of small-scale plumes rising through the prominence. Characterized by clustered spicules jetting at higher speeds (sometimes exceeding the typical chromopsheric Alfven speed) and longer life-time (over 15 minutes), the enhanced spicular activity differs markedly from regular spicules. We hence conjecture that the enhanced spicular activity may drive shock waves, which trigger the magnetic Richtmyer-Meshkov instability at the prominence-bubble interface, leading to the formation of small-scale plumes. These observations provide evidence that the enhanced spicular activity plays a potentially important role in the dynamic evolution of bubbles and plumes, thereby participating in the mass supply of solar prominences.

## 61. [Evolution of JWST Contingency Payload Operations for Mitigating NIRSpec Micro-shutter Array Electrical Shorts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13351) <a id="link61"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13351

**Authors:** Katie Bechtold, Torsten B\"oker, David E. Franz, Dennis Garland, Maurice te Plate, Timothy D. Rawle, Christopher Q. Trinh, Rai Wu, Peter Zeidler

**Abstract:** The Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) is one of four science instruments on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which began routine operations in July 2022. As JWST's primary spectroscopic instrument for faint, distant targets, NIRSpec plays a central role in several of the mission's core science goals. Its signature multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode enables the simultaneous acquisition of spectra for up to a hundred targets across the field of view, using a micro-shutter array (MSA) comprised of nearly 250,000 individually addressable micro-electromechanical shutters.   The MSA is susceptible to occasional electrical shorts, which produce unwanted infrared glow in MOS exposures, rendering them unusable and wasting valuable observatory time. Mitigation requires promptly identifying the affected shutter(s) and masking the corresponding row(s) or column(s) to prevent future activation. However, masking shutters unnecessarily reduces NIRSpec's multiplexing capacity, so it is important to minimize the extent of masking while reliably suppressing the short's effects.   More than two years of operations have informed refinements in technical procedures and operational decision-making around short mitigation. This experience also supports new efforts to identify and unmask previously affected rows or columns where shorts have since disappeared, enabling the recovery of multiplexing capacity that would otherwise remain lost.   As MSA technology matures toward use in future missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory, operational strategies developed for NIRSpec remain relevant beyond JWST. This paper provides an overview of MSA shorts mitigation operations, summarizes shorts observed since the completion of commissioning, and describes the evolving contingency procedures that have enabled continued science productivity from this unique payload.

**Abstract:** The Resolve soft X-ray spectrometer is the high spectral resolution microcalorimeter spectrometer for the XRISM mission. In the beam of Resolve there is a filter wheel containing \xray{} filters. In the beam also is an active calibration source (the modulated X-ray source (MXS) that can provide pulsed \xray s to facilitate gain calibration.   The filter wheel consists of six filter positions. Two open positions, one $^{55}$Fe source to aid in spectrometer characterization during the commissioning phase, and three transmission filters: a neutral density filter, an optical blocking filter, and a beryllium filter.   The X-ray intensity, pulse period, and pulse separation of a MXS are highly configurable. Furthermore, the switch--on time is synchronized with the spacecraft's internal clock to give accurate start and end times of the pulses.   One of the issues raised during ground testing was the susceptibility of a MXS at high voltage to ambient light. Although measures were taken to mitigate the light leak, the efficacy of those measures must be verified in orbit. Along with an overview of issues raised during ground testing, this article will discuss the calibration source and the filter performance in--flight and compare with the transmission curves present in the Resolve calibration database.

## 63. [A Monte Carlo simulation on the scattering coefficients of solar radio wave propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13494) <a id="link63"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13494

**Authors:** Jiazhen Gan, Chuanbing Wang

**Abstract:** Radio waves undergo scattering by small-scale density fluctuations during propagation through the solar-terrestrial environment, substantially affecting the observed characteristics of solar radio bursts. This scattering process can be effectively modeled as photon diffusion in phase space. In this study, we present a comprehensive comparison between the quasilinear diffusion coefficients and those calculated by ray-tracing the photon trajectories in numerically generated, broadband, isotropic density fluctuation fields in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) configurations. The comparative analysis demonstrates that for weak scattering, the simulated diffusion coefficients agree well with the quasilinear theoretical predictions. However, when the radio frequency approaches the electron plasma frequency and/or the density fluctuation amplitude becomes significant, photons experience strong scattering. Under such conditions, the quasilinear theory tends to underestimate the scattering strength of photons induced by 2D density fluctuations while overestimating the scattering strength in 3D cases. Furthermore, we implement a group velocity correction to the theoretical diffusion coefficients, based on the effective propagation speed averaged over all test photons. The corrected coefficients provide an accurate quantification of the scattering strength for radio waves propagating through 3D density fluctuations. The physical mechanisms underlying these phenomena are elucidated in the discussion.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13860

**Authors:** Ruben Camphyn (for the RNO-G collaboration)

**Abstract:** Neutrino astronomy is a vibrant field of study in astrophysics, offering unique insights into the Universe's most energetic phenomena. The combination of a low cross section and zero electromagnetic charge ensure that a neutrino retains most information about its original source while traversing the universe. On the other hand, these low cross sections, combined with a reduced flux at higher energies, make the neutrino one of the most elusive particles to detect in the standard model. The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) aims to detect sporadic neutrino interactions in the Greenlandic ice sheet by means of electromagnetic signals in the radio frequency range, induced by the produced charged secondary particles. The low incoming neutrino flux forces the detector to set a low trigger threshold, leading to the measured data being overwhelmed by thermal noise fluctuations. Hence, a sophisticated and robust filter is needed to differentiate between neutrino-like signals and noise. In this contribution we present the current work on the development of such a filter, based on a convolutional neural network architecture. The network employed uses real RNO-G data and simulated neutrino signals to categorize measured data as noise or neutrino-like events.

## 65. [EUV Late Phase Flares as Observed by EVE and AIA Onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13996) <a id="link65"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13996

**Authors:** Sascha Ornig, Astrid M. Veronig, Karin Dissauer

**Abstract:** Context. EUV late phase (ELP) flares exhibit a second peak in warm coronal emissions minutes to hours after the main peak of the flare. This phase is all but negligible, yet it is still poorly understood what role it plays across the solar cycle and what governs it.   Aims. We present a statistical analysis of ELP flares over four years between May 2010 and May 2014 based on properties like eruptivity, magnetic configuration, and late-phase duration, delay and strength in order to understand what influences the likelihood of this class of flares and their behavior on a general scale.   Methods. We primarily make use of data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's (SDO) Extreme-ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE), as well as complimentary spatial information provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), to assess relationships between the various parameters and see if ELP flares differ from the general flare population. We quantify the criteria for ELP flare definition and determine its characteristics.   Results. Our analysis shows that about 10% of all flares with a GOES class greater than or equal to C3.0 experience an EUV late phase (179 out of 1803). This percentage decreases from solar minimum to solar maximum. C-class flares are considerably less likely to be identified as ELP flares than their higher-energetic counterparts, which is in line with previous investigations. The majority of this type of flares is confined (67%), more so than in the general flare population (greater than or equal to C5.0). There appears to be a (linear) relationship between the late-phase delay and its duration. The ratio of the emission peak of the late and main flare phase lies between 0.3 and 5.9, and exceeds 1 in 71.5% of cases, which is considerably higher than previously reported.

## 66. [The effect of poloidal magnetic field and helicity injection on a breakout CME](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13835) <a id="link66"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.13835

**Authors:** Nitin Vashishtha, Vaibhav Pant, Dana-Camelia Talpeanu, Dipankar Banerjee, Shantanu Rastogi

**Abstract:** Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), as crucial drivers of space weather, necessitate a comprehensive understanding of their initiation and evolution in the solar corona, in order to better predict their propagation. Solar Cycle 24 exhibited lower sunspot numbers compared to Solar Cycle 23, along with a decrease in the heliospheric magnetic pressure. Consequently, a higher frequency of weak CMEs was observed during Solar Cycle 24. Forecasting CMEs is vital, and various methods, primarily involving the study of the global magnetic parameters using datasets like Space-weather Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager Active Region Patches (SHARP), have been employed in earlier works. In this study, we perform numerical simulations of CMEs within a magnetohydrodynamics framework using Message Passing Interface - Adaptive Mesh Refinement Versatile Advection Code (MPI-AMRVAC) in 2.5 dimensions. By employing the breakout model for CME initiation, we introduce a multipolar magnetic field configuration within a background bipolar magnetic field, inducing shear to trigger the CME eruption. Our investigation focuses on understanding the impact of the background global magnetic field on CME eruptions. Furthermore, we analyze the evolution of various global magnetic parameters in distinct scenarios (failed eruption, single eruption, multiple eruptions) resulting from varying amounts of helicity injection in the form of shear at the base of the magnetic arcade system. Our findings reveal that an increase in the strength of the background poloidal magnetic field constrains CME eruptions. Furthermore, we establish that the growth rate of absolute net current helicity is the crucial factor that determines the likelihood of CME eruptions.

**Abstract:** The CCOR Compact Coronagraph is a series of two operational solar coronagraphs sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They were designed, built, and tested by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). The CCORs will be used by NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center to detect and track Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and predict the Space Weather. CCOR-1 is on board the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite -U (GOES-U, now GOES-19/GOES-East). GOES-U was launched from Kennedy Space Flight Center, Florida, on 25 June 2024. CCOR-2 is on board the Space Weather Follow On at Lagrange point 1 (SWFO-L1). SWFO-L1 is scheduled to launch in the fall of 2025. SWFO will be renamed SOLAR-1 once it reaches L1. The CCORs are white-light coronagraphs that have a field of view and performance similar to the SOHO LASCO C3 coronagraph. CCOR-1 FOV spans from 4 to 22 Rsun, while CCOR-2 spans from 3.5 to 26 Rsun. The spatial resolution is 39 arcsec for CCOR-1 and 65 arcsec for CCOR-2. They both operate in a band-pass of 470 - 740 nm. The synoptic cadence is 15 min and the latency from image capture to the forecaster on the ground is less than 30 min. Compared to past generation coronagraphs such as the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO), CCOR uses a compact design; all the solar occultation is done with a single multi-disk external occulter. No internal occulter is used. This allowed a substantial reduction in size and mass compared to SECCHI COR-2, for example, but with slightly lower signal-to-noise ratio. In this article, we review the science that the CCORs will capitalize on for the purpose of operational space weather prediction. We give a description of the driving requirements and accommodations, and provide details on the instrument design. In the end, information on ground processing and data levels is provided.

> ## Relevant Topics
> 
> Use the following relevance criteria when considering which papers to keep. To be rated as highly relevant, a paper must fit at least one of the relevant topics below. Papers which fit multiple categories should be rated more highly.
> 
> 1. Near-Field Cosmology
>    - Relevant: Astrophysics work focusing on dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, extragalactic satellite luminosity functions, measurements of dark matter density profiles (core-cusp), abundances of dwarf galaxies, signs of historic interactions between the Milky Way and other galaxies (e.g., the accreted stellar halo). Both theoretical and observational work is relevant.
>    - Irrelevant: Papers that focus on Milky Way properties like the stellar disk, bar, and Galactic center. Papers that focus on higher mass galaxies, like massive spirals and elliptical galaxies.
> 
> 2. Resolved Star Formation Histories
>    - Relevant: Observational work deriving star formation histories from observed color-magnitude diagrams of galaxies. Theoretical work measuring star formation histories of simulated galaxies is also relevant, but should be weighted lower.
> 
> 3. Star Formation Quenching
>    - Relevant: Observational work discussing the quenching of star formation in galaxies, **particularly dwarf galaxies**. Work on higher mass galaxies may still be relevant, but should be weighted lower. Theoretical work on the quenching of star formation of dwarf galaxies is also relevant.
> 
> 4. Stellar Models
>    - Relevant: Theoretical work presenting new stellar models, either stellar evolutionary tracks (i.e., stellar interior models) or stellar atmosphere models. Work presenting new tables of bolometric corrections is also relevant.
> 
> 5. Numerical Galaxy Simulations
>    - Relevant: Theoretical work presenting new numerical simulations of galaxies is relevant, especially high-resolution simulations. Simulations that include new physics models (e.g., ionizing radiation, cosmic ray transport) should be given increased weight. Work analyzing previously published simulations should be weighted lower, unless the work also pertains to one of the other relevant topics. Semi-analytic work on galaxies that matches the other criteria is also relevant.
>    - Irrelevant: Numerical simulations that do not focus on galaxies and do not fulfill other criteria are not relevant. Examples include simulations of tidal disruption events, black hole accretion disks, and planet formation.
> 
> 6. Star Formation Driven Outflows
>    - Relevant: Observational and theoretical work examining the role the star formation processes play on driving galaxy-scale gas outflows. Measurements of mass-loading factors are particularly relevant. Work commenting on the phase structure of the outflows is also relevant. Work on galaxies more massive than the LMC should be weighted lower.
>    - Irrelevant: Papers that focus on outflows driven by sources other than stellar feedback, such as AGN-driven feedback. Papers are relevant if they include discussion of both star-formation-driven outflows and other types of outflows.
> 
> 7. Circumgalactic Medium
>    - Relevant: Observational and theoretical work examining the circumgalactic media (CGM) of dwarf galaxies is relevant. Increased weight should be given to work that connects the CGM to ISM outflows from the galaxy.

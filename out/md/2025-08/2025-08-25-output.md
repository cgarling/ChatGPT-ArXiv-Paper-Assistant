## 1. [A Novel Approach to Identifying Substructures Through Analysis of Metallicity Distribution Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16233) <a id="link1"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16233

**Authors:** Young Kwang Kim, Young Sun Lee, Timothy C. Beers

**Abstract:** We present a new method for identifying Galactic halo substructures accreted from dwarf galaxies by combining metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) with orbital parameters. Using apogalactic distance-orbital phase space, we assume that the MDF peak of a substructure reflects its progenitor's chemical signature. We test this approach with two Galactic potentials (St\"ackel and McMillan) and find consistent results. Our sample consists of retrograde halo stars with low orbital inclinations and intermediate eccentricities ($0.5 < e \leq 0.7$), drawn from SDSS and LAMOST spectroscopy combined with $Gaia$ DR3 astrometry. We identify four distinct low-inclination retrograde substructures (LRS 1, LRS 2, LRS 3, LRS 4) with MDF peaks at [Fe/H] = $-$1.5, $-$1.7, $-$1.9, and $-$2.1, respectively; LRS3 is newly discovered. Further analysis reveals an additional stream (LRS 2B) with [Fe/H] = $-$2.3 embedded within LRS 2; the remaining LRS 2 stars (LRS 2A) are associated with Sequoia. LRS 1 is likely linked to Thamnos 2 and Arjuna, and LRS 4 to I'itoi. Comparison with the ED-2 stream suggests LRS 2B is chemically distinct, but high-resolution spectroscopy is required to confirm whether they originate from separate progenitors. Our MDF-based approach demonstrates the utility of chemo-dynamical space for uncovering halo substructures, while highlighting caveats such as metallicity gradients and redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation, which may blur the mapping between MDF peaks and progenitors.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new method for identifying Galactic halo substructures accreted from dwarf galaxies using metallicity distribution functions and orbital parameters. This is highly relevant to near-field cosmology, specifically the study of accreted substructures and the chemical signatures of dwarf galaxy progenitors in the Milky Way halo.

## 2. [Extreme Lithium Depletion in Solar Twins: Challenging Non-Standard Mixing Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16513) <a id="link2"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16513

**Authors:** Isabelle Winnick, Jhon Yana Galarza, Henrique Reggiani, Thiago Ferreira, Isabelle Baraffe, Diego Lorenzo-Oliveira, Micaela Oyague, Rita Valle, Renzo Trujillo Diaz, Nathan Leigh, Matias Flores Trivigno, Ricardo Lopez-Valdivia, Gabriela Carvalho Silva, Eder Martioli, Helio Perottoni

**Abstract:** Lithium (Li) is a powerful tracer of stellar mixing, gradually depleted in solar twins by non-standard transport below the convective zone. Here, we identify six new solar twins with exceptionally low Li levels that are not explained by current non-standard mixing models and, together with our previously reported anomalous solar twin HIP 8522, suggest a distinct population marked by a violent evolutionary past. Employing high-resolution spectra ($R=60,000 - 165,000$), we infer precise stellar parameters and chemical compositions, including Li abundances. We consider possible scenarios generating enhanced mixing, including planetary engulfment, blue straggler stars (BSSs), and early episodic accretion. Our planet engulfment simulations indicate that only one star may have engulfed an exoplanet, rapidly depleting Li via thermohaline convection. In the BSS scenario, radial velocity data rule out binary mass transfer, revealing no stellar companions but instead two new exoplanets. If these stars are field BSSs, a binary merger is likely though uncertain given that current BSS models focus mostly on stars in open clusters. Using pre-main-sequence episodic accretion models, we find that solar-mass stars can experience enhanced Li depletion without significant beryllium (Be) depletion. This is consistent with the Be abundances measured in two of our stars and represents the most plausible scenario, pending Be measurements for the remaining stars. These unique stars, together with HIP 8522, represent exceptional cases for testing stellar evolution models and probing internal mixing processes in Sun-like stars.

**Comment:** Presents new findings on lithium depletion in solar twins, directly testing and challenging stellar evolution models and internal mixing processes. Closely matches the 'Stellar Models' criterion.

## 3. [CIGaRS I: Combined simulation-based inference from SNae Ia and host photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15899) <a id="link3"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.15899

**Authors:** Konstantin Karchev, Roberto Trotta, Raul Jimenez

**Abstract:** Using type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia) as cosmological probes requires empirical corrections, which correlate with their host environment. We present a unified Bayesian hierarchical model designed to infer, from purely photometric observations, the intrinsic dependence of SN Ia brightness on progenitor properties (metallicity & age), the delay-time distribution (DTD) that governs their rate as a function of age, and cosmology, as well as the redshifts of all hosts. The model incorporates physics-based prescriptions for star formation and chemical evolution from Prospector-beta, dust extinction of both galaxy and SN light, and observational selection effects.   We show with simulations that intrinsic dependences on metallicity and age have distinct observational signatures, with metallicity mimicking the well-known step of SN Ia magnitudes across a host stellar mass of $\approx 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We then demonstrate neural simulation-based inference of all model parameters from mock observations of ~16 000 SNae Ia and their hosts up to redshift 0.9. Our joint physics-based approach delivers robust and precise photometric redshifts (<0.01 median scatter) and improved cosmological constraints, unlocking the full power of photometric data and paving the way for an end-to-end simulation-based analysis pipeline in the LSST era.

**Comment:** This paper presents a Bayesian hierarchical model to infer SN Ia brightness dependence on progenitor properties (metallicity & age), delay-time distribution, and cosmology, using photometric data. The model incorporates star formation and chemical evolution prescriptions. The work is relevant to resolved star formation histories (criterion 2), as it infers star formation and chemical evolution histories from galaxy photometry, and also touches on stellar models via progenitor properties.

## 4. [What do we mean by stellar mass? The impact of the pre-main sequence on the mass to light ratio of young and intermediate age stellar populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16394) <a id="link4"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16394

**Authors:** Elizabeth R. Stanway (University of Warwick, UK), Conor M. Byrne (University of Warwick, UK), Ankur Upadhyaya (University of Warwick, UK)

**Abstract:** Stellar population synthesis models are an essential tool with which galaxy physical parameters are extracted from observations. However they are built on assumptions designed for use in the local Universe, and not always appropriate to high redshift galaxies. Here we consider the impact of including the hitherto-neglected stellar pre-main sequence delay timescale on the interpretation of composite stellar populations at ages of <1 Gyr. We find that doing so has an impact on the optical luminosity of very young stellar populations of up to ~10 per cent, although smaller changes in observed light (<5 per cent) are expected in most use cases. However the impact on the inferred stellar mass and mass-to-light ratios is significant (a factor of 2 or more), depending on how those properties are defined. We find that the short time scales for star formation in the distant Universe require a clearer definition for the stellar mass in a population, and will impact assumptions about the inferred shape of the stellar initial mass function from observations.

**Comment:** This paper examines the impact of pre-main sequence stellar evolution on the mass-to-light ratio and inferred stellar mass in young and intermediate age stellar populations. It directly addresses the 'Stellar Models' criterion, as it discusses the effect of stellar evolutionary tracks on population synthesis and the interpretation of galaxy properties.

## 5. [Bose-Einstein Condensates in Astrophysics and Cosmology: From Quantum Statistics to Cosmic Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15864) <a id="link5"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.15864

**Authors:** Nader Haddad

**Abstract:** We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and their manifestations in astrophysical and cosmological contexts. Building upon the foundations of quantum statistics in curved spacetime, we derive the conditions for BEC formation under extreme gravitational fields and explore their implications for compact objects and early universe physics. Through rigorous mathematical treatment incorporating general relativistic corrections to the Bose-Einstein distribution, we demonstrate that BEC phenomena may play crucial roles in neutron star interiors, primordial black hole formation, and dark matter halos. Our analysis reveals that the critical temperature for condensation exhibits non-trivial dependence on spacetime curvature, with corrections of order O(GM/rc2) becoming significant near compact objects. We further show that axion dark matter, if it exists, naturally forms a cosmic BEC with coherence length {\lambda}dB ~ 10^-3 pc for ma ~ 10^-22 eV, potentially explaining the observed core-cusp problem in galactic dark matter profiles. These findings suggest that quantum coherence effects at macroscopic scales may be more prevalent in the universe than previously recognized, with profound implications for our understanding of cosmic structure formation and the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions.

**Comment:** Theoretical investigation of Bose-Einstein condensates in astrophysics and cosmology, including implications for dark matter halos and the core-cusp problem. The discussion of axion dark matter and the core-cusp problem is relevant to near-field cosmology and dark matter density profiles in dwarf galaxies.

## 6. [Neural-Network Chemical Emulator for First-Star Formation: Robust Iterative Predictions over a Wide Density Range](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16114) <a id="link6"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16114

**Authors:** Sojun Ono, Kazuyuki Sugimura

**Abstract:** We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution in Population~III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H, H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10% in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method, where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time. This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.

**Comment:** Presents a neural-network chemical emulator for Population III star formation, accelerating hydrodynamic simulations. This is relevant to stellar models and numerical galaxy simulations, especially as it introduces new computational methods for simulating star formation.

## 7. [Simulation based inference of the ionization history from the 2D 21 cm power spectrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16329) <a id="link7"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16329

**Authors:** Nadia Cooper, Carina Norregaard, Romain Meriot, Jonathan R. Pritchard

**Abstract:** The 21 cm signal contains a wealth of information about the formation of the first stars and the reionization of the intergalactic medium during the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The timing of these important milestones has only roughly been constrained through indirect measurements, such as from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) optical depth, and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Therefore, inferring the neutral fraction over cosmic time is a goal of upcoming 21 cm experiments, such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). We contrast two approaches to infer astrophysical parameters and ionization history from 21 cm 2D power spectra (2DPS). We develop an emulator of the 21 cm 2DPS, trained on 21cmFAST simulations, taking into account the expected instrumental noise from the SKA and sample variance. We then perform simulation based inference (SBI) using neural posterior estimation (NPE). We compare training on datasets of noisy 2DPS obtained from 21cmFAST simulations and an emulator, to infer astrophysical parameters of interest. Using an emulator of the ionization history, which has been trained on simulations from the same astrophysical parameters, we then obtain posterior distributions of the ionization history over the redshift range z $\sim$ 5-12. We demonstrate that both methods are capable of accurately recovering the ionization history and astrophysical parameters. However, coverage tests indicate that adding emulated samples does not improve predictions. This work suggests that due to the stochastic nature of the 2DPS, using an emulator of this summary statistic may result in poorer inference.

**Comment:** Presents simulation-based inference of the ionization history from the 21 cm power spectrum, using 21cmFAST simulations. This is relevant to 'Numerical Galaxy Simulations' and, to a lesser extent, near-field cosmology, as it deals with the formation of the first stars and reionization history.

## 8. [Glimmers in the Cosmic Dawn. III. On the Photometrically Determined Black Hole Mass to Stellar Mass Relation Across Cosmic Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15905) <a id="link8"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.15905

**Authors:** Alice R. Young, Matthew J. Hayes, Alberto Saldana-Lopez, Axel Runnholm, Vieri Cammelli, Jonathan C. Tan, Richard S. Ellis, Benjamin W. Keller, Jens Melinder, Jasbir Singh

**Abstract:** We present the results from performing spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting on 121 variable active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) using photometry from both the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) covering $0.2 - 4.8$ microns. We designed a bespoke SED fitting code which decomposes the total SED into its stellar and AGN contributions. Our SED fitting retrieves a significant contribution to the total SED from an AGN template for 26 of our variable sources with $0 < z < 7$. We leverage the model AGN spectrum to estimate black hole masses ($M_{BH}$) using the measured luminosity at 5100 \r{A} and local empirical calibrations. Common with recently discovered JWST broad line AGN (BL-AGN), we observe a trend in the $M_{BH} - M_{\ast}$ plane where low redshift sources have $M_{BH}$ which agree with local relations while high redshift sources have increasingly overmassive black holes with respect to the stellar mass ($M_{\ast}$) of their host galaxies. Within our sample, we identify two IMBH candidates hosted by dwarf galaxies at $z6$. This object has $z_{phot} = 6.74$ and we estimate a lower limit on its black hole mass of $\log_{10}(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) > 7.36$.

**Comment:** SED fitting of AGN candidates in the HUDF to study the black hole mass to stellar mass relation across cosmic time. While it identifies IMBH candidates in dwarf galaxies, the main focus is on AGN and black hole scaling relations, not on near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or quenching in dwarfs. Borderline relevance due to mention of dwarf galaxies.

## 9. [Spinning into the Gap: Direct-Horizon Collapse as the Origin of GW231123 from End-to-End GRMHD Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15887) <a id="link9"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.15887

**Authors:** Ore Gottlieb, Brian D. Metzger, Danat Issa, Sean E. Li, Mathieu Renzo, Maximiliano Isi

**Abstract:** GW231123, the most massive binary black hole (BH) merger observed to date, involves component BHs with masses inside the pair-instability mass gap and unusually high spins. This challenges standard formation channels such as classical stellar evolution and hierarchical mergers. However, stellar rotation and magnetic fields, which have not been systematically incorporated in prior models, can strongly influence the BH properties. We present the first self-consistent simulations tracking a massive, low-metallicity helium star from helium core burning through collapse, BH formation, and post-BH formation accretion using 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. Starting from a $250\,M_\odot$ helium core, we show that collapse above the pair-instability mass gap, aided by rotation and magnetic fields, drives mass loss through disk winds and jet launching. This enables the formation of highly spinning BHs within the mass gap and reveals a BH spin-mass correlation. Strong magnetic fields extract angular momentum from the BH through magnetically driven outflows, which in turn suppress accretion, resulting in slowly spinning BHs within the mass gap. In contrast, stars with weak fields permit nearly complete collapse and spin-up of the BH to $ a\approx1$. We show that massive low-metallicity stars with moderate magnetic fields naturally produce BHs whose masses and spins match those inferred for GW231123, and are also consistent with those of GW190521. The outflows may impart a BH kick, which can induce spin-orbit misalignment and widen the post-collapse orbit, delaying the merger. The outflows launched during collapse may power short-lived, high-luminosity jets comparable to the most energetic $\gamma$-ray bursts, offering a potential observational signature of such events in the early universe.

**Comment:** The paper presents end-to-end GRMHD simulations of massive star collapse to black holes, focusing on the origin of massive, highly spinning black holes in the pair-instability mass gap. While it involves advanced simulations and outflows, the focus is on massive black holes and not on galaxies, dwarf galaxies, or the specified core topics.

## 10. [A Comparison of Full Spectral Fitting Codes for Measuring the Stellar Initial Mass Function and Other Stellar Population Properties in Elliptical Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16525) <a id="link10"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16525

**Authors:** Ilaria Lonoce, Anja Feldmeier-Krause, Alexandra Masegian, Wendy L. Freedman

**Abstract:** We present a comparative test of four widely used full spectral fitting codes, with the aim of answering the question: how robust is the retrieval of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and other stellar properties of galaxies? We used ALF, PyStaff, Starlight, and pPXF to fit a set of optical+near-infrared spectroscopic data from the Magellan telescope of the two brightest galaxies in the Fornax cluster, NGC1399 and NGC1404. By fitting the same data set with the same models, we can compare the radial trends (out to ~ R_e) of IMF slope, age, metallicity and 19 elemental abundances when allowed with the four codes. To further test the robustness of our analysis, we carried out parallel simulations by creating inputs with different star formation history (SFH) complexity. The results from simulations show that codes such as ALF and PyStaff, which both assume a simple stellar population (SSP) return greater precision and accuracy only when the underlying population is a pure SSP; however, in cases where the SFH is more complex, these codes return erroneous results. Although codes like Starlight and pPXF, which retrieve the best-fit SFH without prior assumptions, tend to produce results with greater scatter and bias, they are generally more reliable in identifying secondary components. Our analysis on the two targets shows that ALF and PyStaff, that assume an SSP, give results pointing to a single old age, a decreasing metallicity with radius and a flat super-Salpeter IMF. In contrast, Starlight and pPXF suggest the presence of a secondary component with different metallicity and IMF characteristics.

**Comment:** Compares spectral fitting codes for measuring the IMF and stellar population properties in elliptical galaxies. While it discusses stellar population modeling, the focus is on massive ellipticals and not on dwarf galaxies or resolved star formation histories. Marginal relevance for 'Stellar Models' and 'Numerical Galaxy Simulations' criteria.

## 11. [Ultralight dark matter from non-slowroll inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16455) <a id="link11"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16455

**Authors:** Martina La Rosa, Gianmassimo Tasinato

**Abstract:** The longitudinal mode of a massive vector field, generated during inflation, offers a well-motivated and phenomenologically rich candidate for dark matter. We show that a rapid variation in the mass of the vector boson, occurring during a brief phase of non-slowroll inflationary evolution, can naturally give rise to extremely small vector masses after inflation ends, corresponding to an ultralight dark matter candidate. This mechanism predicts a stochastic gravitational-wave background, generated at second order by non-adiabatic longitudinal vector fluctuations and amplified at very low frequencies, yielding a distinctive observational signature of the scenario. By leveraging a brief departure from slowroll dynamics during inflation - commonly invoked in scenarios that produce primordial black holes - our framework establishes a novel connection between ultralight vector dark matter and primordial black hole physics, suggesting a possible unified setting for mixed dark matter scenarios.

**Comment:** This paper discusses ultralight dark matter production mechanisms from inflation, with connections to primordial black holes. While dark matter is a core topic in near-field cosmology, the focus here is on early universe physics and dark matter candidates, not on dwarf galaxies, satellite luminosity functions, or resolved star formation histories. No direct connection to the specific criteria listed.

**Abstract:** CO isotopologues are common tracers of the bulk molecular gas in extragalactic studies, providing insights into the physical and chemical conditions of the cold molecular gas, a reservoir for star formation. Since star formation occurs within molecular clouds, mapping CO isotopologues at cloud-scale is important to understanding the processes driving star formation. However, achieving this mapping at such scales is challenging and time-intensive. The Surveying the Whirlpool Galaxy at Arcseconds with NOEMA (SWAN) survey addresses this by using the Institut de radioastronomie millim\'etrique (IRAM) NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) to map the $^{13}$CO(1-0) and C$^{18}$O(1-0) isotopologues, alongside several dense gas tracers, in the nearby star-forming galaxy M51 at high sensitivity and spatial resolution ($\approx$ 125 pc).We examine the $^{13}$CO(1-0) to C$^{18}$O(1-0) line emission ratio as a function of galactocentric radius and star formation rate surface density to infer how different chemical and physical processes affect this ratio at cloud scales across different galactic environments: nuclear bar, molecular ring, northern and southern spiral arms. In line with previous studies conducted at kiloparsec scales for nearby star-forming galaxies, we find a moderate positive correlation with galactocentric radius and a moderate negative correlation with star formation rate surface density across the field-of-view (FoV), with slight variations depending on the galactic environment. We propose that selective nucleosynthesis and changes in the opacity of the gas are the primary drivers of the observed variations in the ratio.

**Comment:** The paper studies molecular gas tracers and their ratios in the M51 galaxy, a massive spiral. While it discusses star formation processes, the focus is on a high-mass galaxy and does not address dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, or outflows. Only tangential relevance to star formation quenching and ISM/CGM topics.

## 13. [Terrestrial Exoplanet Internal Structure Constraints Enabled by Comprehensive Host Star Characterization Reveal that Terrestrial Planets in Mean-motion Resonances are Water Rich](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16421) <a id="link13"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16421

**Authors:** Alejandra Ross, Henrique Reggiani, Kevin C. Schlaufman, Mykhaylo Plotnykov, Diana Valencia

**Abstract:** Exoplanet mass and radius inferences fundamentally rely on host star mass and radius inferences. Despite the importance of host star mass, radius, and elemental abundance inferences for the derivation of exoplanet internal structure constraints, published constraints have often been based on inferences that are not self-consistent. For 24 dwarf stars hosting terrestrial exoplanets, we use astrometric and photometric data plus high-resolution spectroscopy to infer accurate, precise, homogeneous, and physically self-consistent photospheric and fundamental stellar parameters as well as elemental abundances. We infer updated planetary masses and radii using these data plus Doppler and transit observables, then use the complete data set to derive constraints on the core-mass fractions of these terrestrial exoplanets. We find that the population of resonant or likely formerly resonant terrestrial exoplanets represented by Kepler-36 b and Kepler-105 c has a significantly lower mean core-mass fraction than the rest of the terrestrial exoplanets in our sample. Their resonant configurations suggest that they migrated inwards from more distant formation locations, and we attribute their low densities to the incorporation and retention of significant amounts of water during their formation. We confirm that the ultra-short-period exoplanets 55 Cnc e and WASP-47 e have densities inconsistent with pure-rock compositions. We propose that they are both the stripped cores of mini-Neptunes and associate their low densities with the presence of significant amounts of hydrogen, helium, water, and/or other volatiles in their interiors. We verify that our results are independent of stellar parameter and elemental abundance inference approach and therefore robust.

**Comment:** This paper uses detailed stellar characterization to constrain the internal structure of terrestrial exoplanets. While it involves stellar parameter inference, it does not present new stellar models or evolutionary tracks, nor does it address galaxy or star formation topics.

## 14. [Exploring HI Galaxy Redshift Survey Strategies for the FAST Core Array Interferometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16234) <a id="link14"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16234

**Authors:** Zhenglong Li, Diyang Liu, Chengliang Xu, Yichao Li, Xin Zhang

**Abstract:** We explore the feasibility of HI galaxy redshift surveys with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) and its proposed Core Array interferometry. Using semi-analytical simulations, we compare the performance of the FAST single-dish and Core Array modes in drift scan (DS) and on-the-fly (OTF) observations across different redshifts. Our results show that the FAST single-dish mode enables significant HI detections at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 0.35$) but is limited at higher redshifts due to shot noise. The Core Array interferometry, with higher sensitivity and angular resolution, provides robust HI galaxy detections up to $z \sim 1$, maintaining a sufficient number density for power spectrum measurements and BAO constraints. At low redshifts ($z \sim 0.01$ -- $0.08$), both configurations perform well, though cosmic variance dominates uncertainties. At higher redshifts ($z > 0.35$), the Core Array outperforms the single-dish mode, while increasing the survey area has little impact on single-dish observations due to shot noise limitations. The DS mode efficiently covers large sky areas but is constrained by Earth's rotation, whereas the OTF mode allows more flexible deep-field surveys at the cost of operational overhead. Our findings highlight the importance of optimizing survey strategies to maximize FAST's potential for HI cosmology. The Core Array is particularly well-suited for high-redshift HI galaxy surveys, enabling precise constraints on large-scale structure and dark energy.

**Comment:** Explores HI galaxy redshift survey strategies and the capabilities of FAST for HI cosmology. While it discusses galaxy surveys and large-scale structure, it does not focus on dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, or near-field cosmology. No direct match to the core criteria.

## 15. [Constraining light dark matter in vector-scalar portals with COSI and AMEGO-X](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15891) <a id="link15"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.15891

**Authors:** Ma\'ira Dutra, Clarissa Siqueira, Tonia M. Venters

**Abstract:** Detecting gamma-ray signals that could be due to dark matter (DM) particles would give us invaluable information about the nature of DM. In particular, gamma-ray lines could provide a way to measure the DM mass. The excellent energy resolution of the upcoming Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) will allow us to probe underexplored regions of the DM parameter space while being sensitive to distinctive spectral features of potential DM signals. In this work, we consider a fermionic sub-GeV DM charged under a new U(1) gauge symmetry. Both the DM and the new gauge boson $Z'$ acquire mass from a new singlet scalar. The masses of the new particles in this class of vector-scalar portal models are naturally at the MeV scale, enabling detectable gamma-ray lines in the bandpasses of COSI and proposed missions such as the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X). We estimate the sensitivity of COSI and AMEGO-X to sub-GeV DM in this context, considering a B-L and a purely axial $Z'$ as benchmark examples. We find regions of the parameter space where COSI will provide leading constraints, beyond the strong CMB limits. On the other hand, AMEGO-X would probe most of the viable parameter space leading to continuum gamma rays.

**Comment:** This work constrains light dark matter models using gamma-ray observations, focusing on new physics portals and upcoming missions. While relevant to dark matter detection, it does not address near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, or the other specified core topics.

## 16. [Simulation-Based Inference for Direction Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays with Radio Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15991) <a id="link16"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.15991

**Authors:** Oscar Macias, Zachary Mason, Matthew Ho, Ars\`ene Ferri\`ere, Aur\'elien Benoit-L\'evy, Mat\'ias Tueros

**Abstract:** Ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) observatories require unbiased direction reconstruction to enable multi-messenger astronomy with sparse, nanosecond-scale radio pulses. Explicit likelihood methods often rely on simplified models, which may bias results and understate uncertainties. We introduce a simulation-based inference pipeline that couples a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) to a normalizing-flow posterior within the \textit{Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference} framework. Each event is seeded by an analytic plane-wavefront fit; the GNN refines this estimate by learning spatiotemporal correlations among antenna signals, and its frozen embedding conditions an eight-block autoregressive flow that returns the full Bayesian posterior. Trained on about $8,000$ realistic UHECR air-shower simulations generated with the ZHAireS code, the posteriors are temperature-calibrated to meet empirical coverage targets. We demonstrate a sub-degree median angular resolution on test UHECR events, and find that the nominal 68\% highest-posterior-density contours capture $71\% \pm 2\%$ of true arrival directions, indicating a mildly conservative uncertainty calibration. This approach provides physically interpretable reconstructions, well-calibrated uncertainties, and rapid inference, making it ideally suited for upcoming experiments targeting highly inclined events, such as GRAND, AugerPrime Radio, IceCube-Gen2, RNO-G, and BEACON.

**Comment:** This paper introduces a simulation-based inference pipeline for reconstructing the direction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays using radio arrays. While it uses advanced simulation and machine learning techniques, it does not focus on galaxy simulations or any of the core topics.

## 17. [On the hypothesis of a bi-isotropic plasma permeating the interstellar space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15879) <a id="link17"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.15879

**Authors:** Filipe S. Ribeiro, Pedro D. S. Silva, Rodolfo Casana, Manoel M. Ferreira Jr

**Abstract:** In this work, we study the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a magnetized chiral plasma that pervades the interstellar space. The Maxwell equations, supplemented by bi-isotropic constitutive relations, are rewritten to describe a cold, uniform, and collisionless plasma model that yields new collective electromagnetic modes for distinct pairs of refractive indices associated with right- and left-handed circularly polarized waves. We have investigated the optical behavior through the rotatory power (RP) and dichroism coefficient, reporting that the finite chiral parameter induces double RP sign reversal, an exotic optical signature that takes place in chiral dielectrics and rotating plasmas. In the low-frequency regime, a modified propagating helicon with right-handed circular polarization is obtained. Next, supposing that the interstellar medium behaves as a bi-isotropic cold plasma, we employ Astrophysical data of radio pulsars to achieve upper limits on the magnetoelectric parameters magnitude. In particular, by using dispersion measure and rotation measure data from five pulsars, we constrain the magnitude of the chiral parameter to the order of $10^{-16}$ and $10^{-22}$, respectively.

**Comment:** The paper studies electromagnetic wave propagation in a chiral plasma in the interstellar medium, with constraints from pulsar data. While it touches on ISM physics, it does not directly address any of the core topics such as dwarf galaxies, star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

**Abstract:** Stars are born in a variety of environments that determine how they gather gas to achieve their final masses. It is generally believed that disks are ubiquitous around protostars as a result of angular momentum conservation and are natural places to grow planets. As such, they are proposed to be the last link in the inflow chain from the molecular cloud to the star. However, disks are not the only form that inflows can take. Here we report on high-resolution observations performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array that reveal inflows in the form of streamers. These streamers persist well within the expected disk radius, indicating that they play a substitute role channeling material from the envelope directly to an unresolved small disk or even directly to the forming high-mass protostar. These flows are massive enough to feed the central unresolved region at a rate sufficient to quench the feedback effects of the young massive star.

**Comment:** High-resolution observations of massive streamers feeding high-mass young stars. The focus is on star formation in high-mass protostars, not on dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy-scale outflows. No direct match to the core criteria.

**Abstract:** We synthesized the astrochemically relevant molecule 3-hydroxypropanal (HOCH$_2$CH$_2$CHO) and subsequently measured and analyzed its rotational spectrum in several frequency regions ranging from 130 to 485 GHz. We analyzed the ground vibrational state as well as the two perturbed lowest-lying vibrationally excited states. With the resulting rotational parameters, we searched for this molecule in the Sagittarius B2(N) and NGC 6334I hot cores, the IRAS 16293-2422B hot corino, and the G+0.693-0.027 and TMC-1 molecular clouds. Rotational emission of 3-hydroxypropanal was tentatively detected toward G+0.693-0.027 and a column density of (8.6$\pm$1.4)$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ was determined. However, this molecule was not detected in the other sources that were investigated. The chemical implications of this tentative discovery are analyzed and several potential chemical formation pathways of this species are discussed.

**Comment:** This paper reports the rotational spectroscopy and tentative interstellar detection of 3-hydroxypropanal in molecular clouds. While it is astrochemical and involves molecular clouds, it does not address galaxy-scale processes, star formation histories, or any of the core criteria.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16155

**Authors:** Pranshu Mandal, Tomu Nitta, Makoto Nagai, Nario Kuno

**Abstract:** We present a new algorithm, ChunkedPCA, to remove common background fluctuations from datasets acquired with a radio camera. ChunkedPCA is an improvement on using PCA to achieve fewer artifacts and better RMS on the cleaned dataset. The proposed algorithm determines the background fluctuation by grouping the detector pixels not used in the direct observation of the source. This group is then used to get the background fluctuation for that time and used to subtract the background from the data of all pixels. We apply ChunkedPCA for the numerical simulation data and a real observation data obtained with the MKID camera on the Nobeyama 45-m telescope to verify the effectiveness of the ChunkedPCA. We confirm that using the ChunkedPCA method preserves the flux of the astronomical sources and produces a cleaner baseline than the conventional PCA method.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new data reduction method for radio camera observations, focusing on background subtraction. While useful for observational astronomy, it does not directly address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

**Authors:** Katharena Christy, James B. Dent, Sumit Ghosh, Jason Kumar, J. O'Thello Ward

**Abstract:** We consider the impact on cosmological first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) of low-temperature thermal corrections to the effective potential. These are corrections from degrees of freedom whose field-dependent masses are much smaller than the nucleation temperature in the true vacuum, though they may be much larger than the nucleation temperature in the false vacuum. Although the general form of these corrections to the thermal effective potential can be quite complicated, we argue that the net effect of all such corrections can be well-modeled with a single new parameter. We determine the shift in the parameters of the FOPT in terms of this new parameter, and the impact on gravitational wave signals and cosmological observables.

**Comment:** The paper discusses thermal corrections to first-order phase transitions and their impact on gravitational wave signals and cosmological observables. While cosmological in nature, it does not address near-field cosmology, galaxy formation, or any of the core topics.

**Authors:** Rajesh Maiti, Jesper Leong, Debarati Chatterjee, Anthony W. Thomas

**Abstract:** The fundamental ($f$-mode) oscillations of neutron stars are studied within the quark meson coupling model, a relativistic Hartree-Fock theory of dense nuclear matter, which takes into account the self-consistent modification of the valence quark structure of the bound baryons in the associated strong Lorentz scalar mean fields. For the first time, hyperons and H-dibaryons are included, along with the effects of potential additional short-range repulsion within this scheme, and their influence on $f$-modes is investigated. Universal relations are studied within the relativistic Cowling approximation and compared against those in the existing literature for potential applications in gravitational wave asteroseismology.

**Comment:** The paper studies neutron star oscillations and the impact of hyperons and H-dibaryons. This is focused on dense nuclear matter and neutron star physics, which does not match any of the core criteria (no connection to dwarf galaxies, star formation histories, galaxy simulations, or outflows).

**Abstract:** We present the first catalog of targeted searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) from 114 active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may host supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), using the NANOGrav 15 yr data set. By incorporating electromagnetic priors on sky location, distance, redshift, and CW frequency, our strain and chirp mass upper limits are on average 2.6$\times$ more constraining than sky-averaged limits. Bayesian model comparisons against a common uncorrelated red noise for the gravitational wave background (GWB) disfavor a CW signal for almost all targets, yielding a mean Bayes factor of $0.87 \pm 0.31$. There are two notable exceptions: SDSS J153636.22+044127.0, ``Rohan'' with $\mathrm{BF} = 3.37(5)$, and SDSS J072908.71+400836.6, ``Gondor'' with $\mathrm{BF} = 2.44(3)$. These Bayes factors correspond to p-values of $0.01$--$0.03$ ($1.9\sigma$--$2.3\sigma$) and $0.05$--$0.08$ ($1.4\sigma$--$1.6\sigma$), respectively, depending on the empirical null distribution. We outline the beginnings of a detection protocol by identifying and carrying out a battery of tests on Rohan and Gondor to verify their binary nature. Notably, when replacing the common uncorrelated red noise model with a Hellings--Downs correlated GWB, Rohan's Bayes factor drops to $1.25(7)$, while Gondor's increases to $3.2(1)$. Both have rich electromagnetic datasets, including optical and infrared variability and spectroscopic features that support their classification as SMBHB candidates, though this was discovered after the targeted searches were complete. Our results suggest more simulations are needed to confirm or refute the nature of these and future SMBHB candidates, while creating a roadmap for targeted CW detection.

**Comment:** This paper presents targeted searches for supermassive black hole binaries in AGN using gravitational wave data. The focus is on SMBHBs and AGN, which are not relevant to the core topics (dwarf galaxies, near-field cosmology, star formation histories, etc.).

**Authors:** Shashwat Singh, Christian E. A. Chapman-Bird, Christopher P L Berry, John Veitch

**Abstract:** Gravitational waves from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), the inspirals of stellar-mass compact objects into massive black holes, are predicted to be observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). A sufficiently large number of EMRI observations will provide unique insights into the massive black hole population. We have developed a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework capable of constraining the parameters of the EMRI population, accounting for selection biases. We leverage the capacity of a feed-forward neural network as an emulator, enabling detectability calculations of $\sim10^5$ EMRIs in a fraction of a second, speeding up the likelihood evaluation by $\gtrsim6$ orders of magnitude. We validate our framework on a phenomenological EMRI population model. This framework enables studies of how well we can constrain EMRI population parameters, such as the slope of both the massive and stellar-mass black hole mass spectra and the branching fractions of different formation channels, allowing further investigation into the evolution of massive black holes.

**Comment:** The paper develops a Bayesian inference framework to constrain the population of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) from LISA data, focusing on massive black holes and compact objects. It does not address any of the core topics such as dwarf galaxies, star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

**Abstract:** Classical novae in the Milky Way have now been well-established as high-energy GeV $\gamma$-ray sources. In novae with main-sequence companions, this emission is believed to result from shocks internal to the nova ejecta, as a later fast wind collides with an earlier slow outflow. To test this model and constrain the $\gamma$-ray production mechanism, we present a systematic study of a sample of recent Galactic novae, comparing their $\gamma$-ray properties ($\gamma$-ray luminosity and duration) with their outflow velocities, peak $V$-band magnitudes, and the decline times of their optical light curves ($t_2$). We uniformly estimate distances in a luminosity-independent manner, using spectroscopic reddening estimates combined with three-dimensional Galactic dust maps. Across our sample, $\gamma$-ray luminosities ($>$100 MeV) vary by three orders of magnitude, spanning $10^{34}-10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Novae with larger velocity of the fast outflow (or larger differential between the fast and slow outflow) have larger $\gamma$-ray luminosities, but are detectable for a shorter duration. The optical and $\gamma$-ray fluxes are correlated, consistent with substantial thermal emission in the optical from shock-heated gas. Across six novae with $\gamma$-ray and infrared light curves, evidence for dust formation appears soon after the end of the detected $\gamma$-ray emission. Dusty and non-dusty novae appear to have similar $\gamma$-ray luminosities, though novae that have more material processed by the shocks may be more likely to form dust. We find that the properties of the $\gamma$-ray emission in novae depend heavily on the ejecta properties, and are consistent with expectations for internal shocks.

**Comment:** Focuses on gamma-ray emission from classical novae and the role of shocks in nova outflows. While it discusses outflows, these are not galaxy-scale nor star-formation-driven, and the context is not dwarf galaxies or the CGM. No direct match to the core criteria.

## 26. [Methods for Estimating Neutron Star Parameters using Multiple Mechanisms for Gravitational Wave Emission Associated with Pulsar Glitches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15965) <a id="link26"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.15965

**Authors:** Matthew Ball, Raymond Frey

**Abstract:** Several mechanisms for gravitational wave (GW) emission are believed to be associated with pulsar glitches. This emission may be split between long duration continuous waves and short duration bursts. In the Advanced LIGO era, searches for GWs associated with pulsar glitches have only considered continuous wave emission. The increasing sensitivity of the detectors and the prospects for future detectors suggest that astrophysically motivated analyses involving multiple mechanisms may be possible. Here, we present a framework for combining two simple models for GW emission - long duration continuous waves and short duration bursts - to derive more constraining astrophysical implications than a single model would allow. The best limits arise from using models that predict a specific amount of GW emission; however, there are relatively few models that make such predictions. We apply these methods to the December 2016 Vela pulsar glitch and make predictions for how well future observing runs and detectors would improve results. As part of this analysis, we performed a targeted search for GW bursts associated with this glitch and find no signal.

**Comment:** This paper focuses on neutron star parameters and gravitational wave emission mechanisms associated with pulsar glitches. It does not match any of the core criteria such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, galaxy simulations, or stellar models.

## 27. [Probing the emission geometry of the X-ray pulsar 2S 1417$-$624 during a weak outburst with NICER, IXPE, and NuSTAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16417) <a id="link27"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16417

**Authors:** Menglei Zhou, Pengju Wang, Honghui Liu, Lorenzo Ducci, Sergey S. Tsygankov, Qingchang Zhao, Juri Poutanen, Long Ji, Valery F. Suleimanov, Alexander A. Mushtukov, Qi Liu, Camille M. Diez, Luis Abalo Rodr\'iguez, Victoria Grinberg, Andrea Santangelo

**Abstract:** We report results from a multi-mission observational campaign of the transient X-ray pulsar 2S~1417$-$624 during its 2025 outburst, using data from NICER, IXPE, and NuSTAR. Phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectroscopy with NICER and NuSTAR reveal that a typical power-law model with a high-energy cut-off well describes the broadband spectra. Several spectral parameters, however, show clear and systematic modulations with pulse phase, indicating variations in the physical conditions of the emitting plasma over the neutron star's rotation. In particular, IXPE provides the first polarimetric measurements of this source, yielding a phase-averaged polarization degree of $3.3 \pm 1.7\%$ and a polarization angle of ${18}^{\circ} \pm {15}^{\circ}$, both at the $1\sigma$ confidence level. Fitting with the rotating vector model yields a magnetic obliquity of $\theta = 64_{-26}^{+17}$ deg, indicating a significantly inclined magnetic geometry that may approach a quasi-orthogonal configuration. Together, these findings demonstrate pronounced phase-dependent spectral and polarization variability, offering valuable constraints on the geometry and emission processes within the accretion region of this transient X-ray pulsar.

**Comment:** The paper investigates the emission geometry of an X-ray pulsar during an outburst, focusing on neutron star accretion and emission processes. It does not match any of the core criteria such as galaxy simulations, near-field cosmology, or stellar models.

## 28. [The Einstein Telescope Pathfinder and its Vacuum System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16461) <a id="link28"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16461

**Authors:** Thomas H\"ohn (ET-PF), Adrian Schwenck (ET-PF), Thomas Th\"ummler (ET-PF), Joachim Wolf (ET-PF), Ralph Engel (ET-PF), Andreas Haungs (ET-PF), Einstein Telescope Pathfinder (ET-PF), collaboration

**Abstract:** The Einstein Telescope (ET) will be the next generation gravitational wave observatory in Europe with a sensitivity reaching beyond the CMB into the dark era of the Universe. Each corner of the triangular baseline design is the center of two interferometers with 10 km long arms, one operated at room temperature, the other one with mirrors at cryogenic temperatures of 10-15 K that reduce the noise contribution at frequencies as low as 3 Hz. The ETpathfinder (ET-PF) project at Maastricht University is a R\&D facility for the challenging cryogenic interferometer technology of ET. It is a 20m x 20m interferometer with six towers that will house the seismically decoupled cryogenic Si-mirrors, laser systems, and detectors. The KIT group developed the control system of the ultra-high vacuum system for ET-PF, based on the expertise from the KATRIN neutrino mass experiment. In addition, a test facility is currently being set up at KIT to investigate adsorption and desorption processes of residual gas on the cryogenic mirror surfaces, as well as monitoring techniques and in-situ cleaning procedures. This paper presents the objectives and status of these activities and their contribution towards the next generation gravitational wave observatory.

**Comment:** This paper describes the vacuum system and cryogenic technology development for the Einstein Telescope Pathfinder, a gravitational wave observatory. The focus is on instrumentation and technology, not on galaxy evolution, star formation, or near-field cosmology.

## 29. [Role of symmetry energy at subnuclear densities in protoneutron star crusts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16120) <a id="link29"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16120

**Authors:** Ken'ichiro Nakazato, Hajime Togashi, Kohsuke Sumiyoshi, Hideyuki Suzuki

**Abstract:** The impact of matter properties at subnuclear densities on the evolution of protoneutron stars is investigated. Several models of nuclear equation of state (EOS) are constructed with varying saturation parameters, particularly the symmetry energy $S_0$ and its density slope $L$. Using the Thomas--Fermi approximation, the mass and proton numbers of heavy nuclei at subnuclear densities are systematically evaluated, along with their dependence on the EOS. Cooling simulations of protoneutron stars reveal that EOSs with smaller $L$ values lead to a longer cooling timescale and higher average neutrino energies. This behavior is attributed to the enhanced neutrino scattering caused by larger mass numbers, which increases the thermal insulation. Furthermore, the crystallization temperature, marking the onset of crust formation, is found to be higher for EOSs with smaller values of $L$. This is due to the enhanced Coulomb energy associated with larger proton numbers. As a result, despite slower cooling, crust formation occurs earlier for smaller-$L$ EOSs. These findings indicate that the timing of crust formation is sensitive to the EOS and highlight the importance of late-time neutrino observations as probes of the matter properties at subnuclear densities.

**Comment:** Studies the role of symmetry energy in protoneutron star crusts and cooling, which is not directly related to any of the core galaxy or stellar model topics.

## 30. [Fermi-Large Area Telescope Detection of Very High Energy (>100 GeV) Emission from Misaligned Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15921) <a id="link30"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.15921

**Authors:** Gunjan Tomar, Vaidehi S. Paliya, D. J. Saikia, C. S. Stalin

**Abstract:** The detection of very-high-energy (VHE; $>$100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray radiation from misaligned jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) challenges the emission models that primarily explain VHE emissions from beamed AGN, i.e., blazars. Using over 16 years of \textit{Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (\textit{Fermi}-LAT) Pass 8 data in the energy range 0.1$-$2 TeV, we systematically explore the VHE emission from a recently published sample of 160 radio galaxies. We identify 12 sources detected at $>4\sigma$ confidence level (test statistic or TS$>$16), including nine with TS$>$25 and two Fanaroff-Riley type II objects. This detected sample includes seven out of eight previously known VHE objects. Two radio galaxies are detected in the VHE band for the first time, and we identify three promising candidates with 16$<$TS$<$25. Additionally, 13 objects are identified as candidate VHE emitters with at least one VHE photon detected with the \textit{Fermi}-LAT. These findings expand the sample of known VHE-emitting radio galaxies, whose multiwavelength follow-up observations can help provide insights into the emission mechanisms, jet physics, and the contribution of misaligned AGN to the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background.

**Comment:** Focuses on VHE emission from misaligned jetted AGN (radio galaxies), which is outside the scope of the core topics.

## 31. [Cosmological Constraints on Neutrino Masses in a Second-Order CPL Dark Energy Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16238) <a id="link31"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16238

**Authors:** Shubham Barua, Shantanu Desai

**Abstract:** Recent DESI results indicate a strong preference for dynamical dark energy (DE) when baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. We analyze the exponential (EXP) parameterization, which introduces a second-order correction to CPL. We determine and compare the 95% upper bounds on the sum of neutrino masses for three dark energy (DE) models -- $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and EXP -- across four neutrino mass hierarchies (1 massive/2 massless, degenerate, normal, inverted) and multiple dataset combinations (CMB$+$BAO, CMB$+$BAO$+$PantheonPlus, CMB$+$BAO$+$DESY5), employing both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks with physical lower limits from oscillation experiments (0.059 eV and 0.11 eV). Our results show that CPL yields tighter ($\lesssim10$%) bounds compared to EXP. We further confirm earlier findings that neutrino mass constraints are only mildly sensitive to the assumed hierarchy and that the frequentist bounds are tighter than Bayesian ones. Furthermore, the imposed oscillation lower limits, the datasets used and the cosmological model play a crucial role in the inferred cosmological neutrino mass bounds. For the datasets, hierarchies, and DE parameterizations considered, we find no statistically significant evidence for nonzero neutrino mass consistent with oscillation lower limits.

**Comment:** Cosmological constraints on neutrino masses in various dark energy models. This is a cosmology paper focused on fundamental parameters, not on galaxies, star formation histories, or near-field cosmology.

## 32. [Reheating study of Mexican-Hat-type Potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16144) <a id="link32"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16144

**Authors:** Sudhava Yadav, Akash Yadav, K. K. Venkataratnam

**Abstract:** We study reheating in Mexican Hat type potentials, emphasizing the role of the post-inflationary equation-of-state parameter($\overline{\omega }_{\text{re}}$) in shaping observable predictions. By exploring the allowed range of $\overline{\omega }_{\text{re}}$, we derive reheating temperature, e-fold counts, and inflationary observables, showing that the conventional Mexican Hat model satisfies Planck18+BK18+BAO constraints on $n_s$ and r. The analysis underscores reheating as a critical link between theoretical potentials and CMB data. In addition, the holographic Mexican Hat realization is examined as a benchmark, with our results mapping its phenomenological boundaries. This work illustrates how reheating studies sharpen constraints and guide refinements of unified inflationary scenarios.

**Comment:** The paper studies reheating in inflationary cosmology, focusing on Mexican Hat potentials and their implications for CMB observables. It does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, galaxy simulations, or stellar models.

## 33. [Scalar non-standard neutrino interactions in Galactic supernovae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16558) <a id="link33"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16558

**Authors:** Bhaskar Dutta, Aparajitha Karthikeyan, Nityasa Mishra, Yago Porto, Louis E. Strigari

**Abstract:** We analyze the prospects for studying scalar non-standard interactions (SNSI) using the neutrino burst from a Galactic supernova. SNSI modify the resonant flavor conversion and, correspondingly, the neutronization burst signal, and may be identifiable in future multi-tonne-scale experiments such as DUNE. We show that, in the presence of SNSI, neutrinos propagating out of the dense supernova environment acquire a density-squared-dependent contribution to their mass-squared differences, which in turn modifies the energy levels of the neutrino mass eigenstates. This phenomenon is not present in less dense environments like the Earth or the Sun. For a given mass ordering, supernova neutrinos can improve the sensitivity to SNSI parameters by up to four orders of magnitude compared to that achievable with solar or terrestrial neutrino sources.

**Comment:** Focuses on scalar non-standard neutrino interactions in Galactic supernovae; does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

## 34. [Probing Reheating in a Decaying Oscillatory Inflationary Model with Latest ACT Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16538) <a id="link34"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16538

**Authors:** Li-Yang Chen, Rongrong Zha, Feng-Yi Zhang

**Abstract:** Recent observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) indicate a moderate upward shift in the scalar spectral index $n_s$ compared to Planck $2018$, thereby placing tighter constraints on inflationary scenarios. Motivated by these results, we investigate a decaying oscillatory Inflationary model inspired by minimal no-scale supergravity, characterized by the potential $V(\phi) = \lambda \phi^{2n} \sin^2(l/\phi^n)$. We perform a numerical analysis of the background dynamics and reheating process across a range of model parameters. The model yields robust predictions for $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, in excellent agreement with current ACT data. Successful reheating in this model requires a large effective equation-of-state parameter approaching unity, consistent with both cosmic microwave background (CMB) and big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints. The corresponding number of inflationary $e$-folds increases with $n$ and is weakly sensitive to $l$. Overall, the model offers a simple yet predictive framework that captures both inflationary dynamics and post-inflationary reheating, and remains viable under the latest high-precision observations.

**Comment:** Examines inflationary models and reheating in the early universe, not related to near-field cosmology, galaxy simulations, or stellar models.

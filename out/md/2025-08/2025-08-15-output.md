## 1. [Dark Star Clusters or Ultra-Faint Dwarf galaxies? Revisiting UMa3/U1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10543) <a id="link1"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10543

**Authors:** Ali Rostami-Shirazi, Hosein Haghi, Akram Hasani Zonoozi, Pavel Kroupa

**Abstract:** Owing to sparse spectroscopic observations, the classification of faint satellites as either dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies or self-gravitating star clusters remains unresolved. The recently discovered Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 (UMa3/U1) object, with its measured velocity dispersion, provides a rare observational anchor in this regime. Despite its cluster-like compactness, its inferred dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M_dyn/L) suggests a dark matter-dominated nature, prompting interpretations of UMa3/U1 as a microgalaxy, though current measurements remain inconclusive. Thousand-level M_dyn/L values are not unique to galaxies; self-gravitating dark star clusters (DSCs) can reach comparable levels via energy injection driven by a centrally segregated black hole subsystem (BHSub), which accelerates the evaporation of luminous stars and leads to a super-virial appearance with elevated velocity dispersion. To assess whether UMa3/U1 is a DSC, we conducted direct N-body simulations and identified a model that successfully reproduces both its compact structure and elevated M_dyn/L, supporting a self-gravitating cluster origin. We find the cluster entered the DSC phase around 4 Gyr ago, with its luminous stars expected to be depleted within the next 1 Gyr, followed by the gradual disruption of the central BHSub over the subsequent Gyr. We broaden our analysis by mapping DSC evolutionary tracks in the size versus total luminosity (L) and M_dyn/L-L spaces, showing that DSCs occupy a region overlapping with faint, ambiguous satellites. In the M_dyn/L-L diagram, DSCs trace a transitional channel bridging globular clusters and dwarf galaxies as they rise from M_dyn/L ~ 2 to 10^4 M_sun/L_sun.

**Comment:** This paper directly addresses the classification of ultra-faint satellites (UMa3/U1) as either dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies or star clusters, using N-body simulations to explore their nature. This is highly relevant to near-field cosmology, the satellite luminosity function, and the core-cusp problem.

## 2. [Stars Born in the Wind: M82's Outflow and Halo Star Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10895) <a id="link2"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10895

**Authors:** Vaishnav V. Rao, Adam Smercina, Eric F. Bell, Benjamin Williams, Julianne J. Dalcanton, Andrew Dolphin, Adam Leroy, Antonela Monachesi, Jeremy Bailin, Roelof S. de Jong, Fabian Walter

**Abstract:** Starburst galaxies, like M82, launch kiloparsec-scale galactic outflows that interact with the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in complex ways. Apart from enriching the CGM with metals and energy, these outflows may trigger star formation in the halo -- either by driving shocks into the CGM or transporting cold, star-forming gas. To investigate such processes, we analyze the star formation history (SFH) of the Southern Arcs -- arc-like stellar features located ~5 kpc from M82's star-forming disk along the minor axis -- using Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 photometry. From resolved stellar populations, we derive SFHs over the last ~500 Myr, finding that ~85% of the stellar mass formed between ~150 and ~70 Myr ago, followed by a brief pause, with the remaining ~15% forming since ~30 Myr ago. The two stellar populations are co-spatial on scales of at least ~200 pc. The timing of the ~100 Myr burst aligns with star formation in the M82 disk and the age distribution of its star clusters, suggesting a causal link between the disk starburst and halo star formation. We explore two mechanisms that could explain these observations. In the first, shocks driven by the interaction between hot outflowing gas and cooler CGM material compress dense clouds, triggering collapse and star formation. In the second, stars form directly within massive, cool clouds associated with the outflow. As these clouds move ballistically through the halo, subsequent interactions with tidal debris may trigger additional star formation, producing the observed episodic structure.

**Comment:** This paper analyzes the star formation history of halo features in M82, a starburst galaxy, using resolved stellar populations. It directly matches the 'Resolved Star Formation Histories' criterion and also discusses star formation driven by outflows, matching 'Star Formation Driven Outflows'. The focus on the connection between disk starburst and halo star formation is highly relevant.

## 3. [SHH method for SIDM: An SIDM-hydro hybrid method for simulating self-interacting dark matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10278) <a id="link3"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10278

**Authors:** Sarah Schon, Michael Ryan, John Blakely, Jeysen Flores-Velazquez, Sarah Shandera, Donghui Jeong

**Abstract:** We present a new scheme to couple existing numerical methods for elastic self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) to the hydrodynamic equations via a continuous function of the local Knudsen number. The method, an SIDM-hydro hybrid (SHH), allows more efficient simulation of the evolution of inhomogeneous halos deep into the regime of gravothermal collapse. With the improved efficiency gained by moving to a hydrodynamical description in high-density regions, the SHH method allows central densities of two orders of magnitude higher to be reached in considerably less simulation time than traditional methods. Our implementation should be considered as the first step toward a robust SHH method, as we interpolate the first and second moments of the Boltzmann equation in the ideal-fluid limit only. The simulation results are qualitatively similar to those found with other methods, although there are differences in the implementation of the primary physics driving the dynamics, and in the details of the resulting halo profiles. However, our results indicate that the SHH technique shows promise to investigate gravothermal collapse in diverse, dynamical environments. The method can be extended to incorporate non-ideal fluid terms and dissipation, as needed for dark-matter scenarios where interactions beyond the elastic regime may be important in the dense interiors of some halos.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new numerical method for simulating self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) in halos, focusing on gravothermal collapse and halo density profiles. This directly matches the 'Numerical Galaxy Simulations' criterion, especially as it introduces a new simulation technique relevant for studying dark matter density profiles (core-cusp problem) in halos, which is a key topic in near-field cosmology.

## 4. [Emulating extended Lyman-alpha haloes around star-forming galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10095) <a id="link4"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10095

**Authors:** Pengfei Li, Zheng Zheng

**Abstract:** Extended Ly$\alpha$ emission is commonly observed around star-forming galaxies, opening a window for probing the neutral hydrogen gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). In this paper, we develop a prescription of spherically symmetric CGM gas properties and build emulators to model circularly-averaged surface brightness (SB) profiles of the extended Ly$\alpha$ emission. With CGM gas properties parametrized by the density, velocity, and temperature profiles, a self-shielding calculation is carried out to obtain the neutral gas distribution with ionizing photons from the ultraviolet (UV) background and star formation in the galaxy. Our calculation reveals three types of systems with distinct neutral gas distribution: non-shielded systems with the CGM being highly ionized across all radii, shielded systems with a neutral gas shell shielding the UV background, and transitional systems in between. Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles are obtained through Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer (RT) simulations, performed for the CGM models with three kinds of Ly$\alpha$ sources: the star formation from central and satellite galaxies, and the recombination in the CGM. We build emulators to efficiently predict Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles for given model parameters and Ly$\alpha$ sources, based on Gaussian process regression. After being trained with only 180 RT simulations for each Ly$\alpha$ source, the emulators reach an overall accuracy at the level of $\sim 20$ per cent. By applying the emulators to fit mock Ly$\alpha$ SB profiles constructed from our model, we find a reasonable recovery of model parameters, indicating the potential of extracting physical information of the CGM and galaxies from the observed extended Ly$\alpha$ emission.

**Comment:** This paper develops models and emulators for extended Lyman-alpha halos around star-forming galaxies, specifically probing the neutral hydrogen in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The focus on CGM properties and connection to star formation makes it relevant to the 'Circumgalactic Medium' and 'Star Formation Driven Outflows' criteria, though the galaxy mass range is not specified and may include more massive galaxies.

## 5. [Constraining fuzzy dark matter with the 21-cm power spectrum from Cosmic Dawn and Reionization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10176) <a id="link5"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10176

**Authors:** Shihang Liu, Yilin Liu, Bowen Peng, Mengzhou Xie, Zelong Liu, Bohua Li, Yi Mao

**Abstract:** The 21-cm signals from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization contain valuable information on cosmological structure formation dominated by dark matter. Measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum can thus probe certain dark matter candidates. Here we investigate the impacts of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) on the 21-cm signals, taking into account both the linear matter power spectrum and the halo mass function (HMF) in FDM cosmologies. The full FDM dynamics are implemented in reionization simulations, along with a new ansatz on modulation of the FDM HMF by the linear overdensity. Not only does the suppression of FDM halos on small scales give rise to delay of the signature epochs during cosmic reionization, but these epochs are also shortened relative to the cold dark matter cosmology. In addition, we find that while the FDM effects on the 21-cm power spectrum are dominated by its linear dynamics early in Cosmic Dawn, a correct FDM HMF resulting from nonlinear wave dynamics must be considered when X-ray heating begins. We forecast the constraints on the FDM model parameters from upcoming 21-cm power spectrum measurements by SKA1-Low (central area). In FDM cosmologies with $m_\mathrm{FDM}=10^{-21}$ eV, SKA1-Low will be able to constrain the boson mass to within $\sim10$% at 2$\sigma$ confidence with a mock 1080-hour observation, if the ionizing efficiency is mass independent. However, our results show that realistic astrophysical processes are degenerate with the FDM effects, which shall severely loosen the constraints on the boson mass from 21-cm power spectrum data alone.

**Comment:** This paper investigates the impact of fuzzy dark matter on the 21-cm power spectrum from Cosmic Dawn and Reionization, focusing on structure formation and the halo mass function. The analysis of the halo mass function and small-scale structure suppression is relevant to near-field cosmology, particularly the abundance of low-mass halos and substructure, though the focus is on high-redshift cosmology rather than the local universe.

## 6. [Can stellar physics explain GW231123?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10088) <a id="link6"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10088

**Authors:** Djuna Croon, Jeremy Sakstein, Davide Gerosa

**Abstract:** The gravitational wave event GW231123 detected by the LIGO interferometers during their fourth observing run features two black holes with source-frame masses of $137^{+22}_{-17} M_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52} M_\odot $ -- well within or above the pair-instability black hole mass gap predicted by standard stellar evolution theory. Both black holes are also inferred to be rapidly spinning ($\chi_1 \simeq 0.9$, $\chi_2 \simeq 0.8$). The primary object in GW231123 is the heaviest stellar mass black hole detected to date, which, together with its extreme rotation, raises questions about its astrophysical origin. Accounting for the unusually large spin of $\sim 0.9$ with hierarchical mergers requires some degree of fine tuning. We investigate whether such a massive, highly spinning object could plausibly form from the collapse of a single rotating massive star. We simulate stars with an initial core mass of $160 \rm M_\odot$ -- sufficient to produce BH masses at the upper edge of the 90% credible interval for $m_1$ in GW231123 -- across a range of rotation rates and $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rates. We find that: (i) rotation shifts the pair-instability mass gap to higher masses, introducing a significant ingredient that correlates masses and spins in gravitational wave predictions; and (ii) highly spinning BHs with masses $\gtrsim 150 \rm M_\odot$ can form above the mass gap, implying that stellar evolution alone is sufficient to explain GW231123. Our results suggest that the primary object of GW231123 may be the first directly observed black hole that formed via direct core collapse following the photodisintegration instability.

**Comment:** This paper investigates whether stellar evolution models can explain the formation of very massive, highly spinning black holes observed in gravitational wave events. It presents new stellar models and simulations of massive star evolution, which matches the 'Stellar Models' criterion, though the focus is on black hole formation rather than general stellar evolution. The relevance is moderate as it is not directly about galaxies or star formation histories, but does present new stellar evolutionary tracks.

**Abstract:** We present detections of auroral emission lines of [OIII], [OII], [SIII], and [SII] in deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for 41 star-forming galaxies at $z=1.4-7.2$ from the AURORA survey. We combine these new observations with 98 star-forming galaxies at $z=1.3-10.6$ with detected auroral lines drawn from the literature to form a sample of 139 high-redshift galaxies with robust electron temperature and direct-method oxygen abundance determinations. This sample notably covers a wider dynamic range in metallicity than previous work, spanning $0.02-0.9$~Z$_\odot$. We calibrate empirical relations between 19 emission-line ratios and oxygen abundance, providing a robust tool set to infer accurate gas-phase metallicities of high-redshift galaxies when auroral lines are not detected. While calibrations based on lines of $\alpha$ elements (O, Ne, S, Ar) appear reliable, we find significant scatter in calibrations involving lines of N driven by a high dispersion in N/O at fixed O/H, suggesting that N-based line ratios are less reliable tracers of the oxygen abundance at high redshift. These new high-redshift calibrations are notably offset from those based on typical $z\sim0$ galaxy and HII region samples, and are better matched by samples of extreme local galaxies that are analogs of high-redshift sources. The new metallicity calibrations presented in this work pave the way for robust studies of galaxy chemical evolution in the early Universe, leading to a better understanding of baryon cycling and galaxy formation from Cosmic Noon through the Epoch of Reionization.

**Comment:** This paper provides new empirical metallicity calibrations for high-redshift galaxies using JWST/NIRSpec data. While it is relevant to galaxy chemical evolution, it does not focus on resolved star formation histories, dwarf galaxies, or the other core topics. The calibrations may be useful for future studies of dwarf galaxies, but this is not the main focus.

## 8. [Web-Halo Model (WHM): Accurate non-linear matter power spectrum predictions without free parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10902) <a id="link8"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10902

**Authors:** Samuel Brieden, Florian Beutler, Marcos Pellejero-Iba\~nez

**Abstract:** We present a parameter-free variant of the halo model that significantly improves the precision of matter clustering predictions, particularly in the challenging 1-halo to 2-halo transition regime, where standard halo models often fail. Unlike HMcode-2020, which relies on 12 phenomenological parameters, our approach achieves comparable or superior accuracy without any free fitting parameters. This new web-halo model (WHM) extends the traditional halo model by incorporating structures that have collapsed along two dimensions (filaments) and one dimension (sheets), in addition to haloes, and combines these with 1-loop Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (1$\ell$-LPT) in a consistent framework. We show that WHM matches N-body simulation power spectra within the precision of state-of-the-art emulators at the 2-halo to 1-halo transition regime at all redshifts. Specifically, the WHM achieves better than 2\% accuracy up to scales of $k = 0.4\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $0.7\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and $1.3\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at redshifts $z = 0.0$, $0.8$, and $1.5$, respectively, for both the baccoemu and EuclidEmu2 emulators, across their full $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM} + \sum m_\nu$ cosmological parameter space. This marks a substantial improvement over 1$\ell$-LPT and HMcode-2020, the latter of which performs similarly at low redshift but deteriorates at higher redshifts despite its 12 tuned parameters. We publicly release WHM as WHMcode, integrated into existing HMcode implementations for CAMB and CLASS.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new, parameter-free variant of the halo model (Web-Halo Model) for predicting the non-linear matter power spectrum, improving accuracy in the 1-halo to 2-halo transition regime. While the halo model is a foundational tool in cosmology, this work is focused on large-scale structure and matter clustering, not directly on near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, or galaxy simulations. However, the improved modeling of non-linear structure could have indirect implications for substructure studies.

## 9. [Globular clusters in M104: Tracing kinematics and metallicities from the centre to the halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10100) <a id="link9"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10100

**Authors:** Katja Fahrion, Michael A. Beasley, Eric Emsellem, Anastasia Gvozdenko, Oliver M\"uller, Marina Rejkuba

**Abstract:** As ancient star clusters, globular clusters (GCs) are regarded as powerful tracers of galaxy evolution and assembly. Due to their brightness and compact sizes, GCs are employed to probe the kinematics and stellar population properties of galaxies, from the central regions out into the halo where the underlying stellar light becomes too faint for spectroscopic studies. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the GC system of M 104 (NGC 4594, also known as the Sombrero galaxy) based on literature spectroscopic catalogues and newly collected data from Very Large Telescope (VLT) MUSE integral-field spectroscopy combined with multi-object spectroscopy from VLT FLAMES and OSIRIS at the Gran Telescopio de Canarias (GTC). We present a new catalogue of 499 GCs with radial velocity measurements that span from the inner disc region out to $\sim$ 70 kpc (24$^{\prime}$). In addition to velocities, we measure metallicities from the MUSE, OSIRIS, and FLAMES spectra of 190 GCs. Together with literature values, we collected a sample of 278 metallicities. Comparing GCs observed with multiple instruments, we find a good agreement of velocity and metallicity measurements. Studying GC kinematics with a simple model confirms a decreasing velocity dispersion profile and low rotation velocities. The blue GCs appear to be more dispersion-dominated, while the red GCs follow the kinematics of the stars more closely. We find a large scatter of GC metallicities with distance from the centre and metal-rich GCs are found over all radii. We discuss that the GC metallicity distribution with a broad metal-poor component likely reflects the complex assembly history of M 104.

**Comment:** This paper studies globular clusters in M104 (Sombrero galaxy), tracing kinematics and metallicities from the center to the halo. While it discusses halo assembly and metallicity distributions, the focus is on a massive spiral galaxy and its globular cluster system, not on dwarf satellites or near-field cosmology. It is borderline relevant for halo assembly history but does not directly match the core criteria.

## 10. [Accelerating cosmological inference of interacting dark energy with neural emulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10876) <a id="link10"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10876

**Authors:** Karim Carrion

**Abstract:** The present thesis aims to tackle two critical aspects of present and future cosmological analysis of Large-Scale Structure (LSS): accurate modelling of the nonlinear matter power spectrum beyond $\Lambda$CDM, and efficient computational techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation. Both are crucial for testing alternative cosmologies and avoiding spurious results. We focus on the Dark Scattering (DS) model, describing pure momentum transfer between dark matter -- dark energy through the parameter $A_{\rm ds}$. To capture DS effects, we adopt the halo model reaction framework within $\tt{ReACT}$, compute the nonlinear DS spectrum, and validate it against $N$-body simulations. We further include baryonic feedback and massive neutrinos, finding degeneracies between DS and baryonic effects but not with neutrinos. We then constrain DS using cosmic shear from KiDS-1000, accelerated by neural emulators from $\tt{CosmoPower}$, which speed up predictions by $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$. Our DS emulator, trained on halo model reaction outputs, preserves percent-level accuracy and incorporates baryonic feedback. Analysing KiDS shear statistics, we obtain $\vert A_{\rm ds}\vert \lesssim 20$ b/GeV at $68 \%$ C.L. Combining KiDS with Planck CMB and BAO data, we find $A_{\rm ds}=10.6^{+4.5}_{-7.3}$ b/GeV at $68 \%$ C.L., suggesting the DS model as a promising resolution to the $S_8$ tension. Finally, we present weak lensing forecasts for Stage IV surveys using an automatically differentiable pipeline with $\tt{jax-cosmo}$ and gradient-based samplers in $\tt{NumPyro}$, reducing computational cost from months on CPUs to days on GPUs. Model evidence is evaluated with $\tt{harmonic}$ under multiple scale cuts. To put things into perspective, the modelling strategies and machine learning accelerations developed here provide powerful tools for the next generation of LSS cosmology.

**Comment:** This thesis focuses on cosmological inference for interacting dark energy models using neural emulators and large-scale structure data. While it involves cosmological simulations and machine learning, it does not focus on galaxy-scale simulations, dwarf galaxies, or the other core topics.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10197

**Authors:** S. Paron, N. C. Martinez, M. E. Ortega, D. Mast, A. Petriella, L. Sup\'an, C. Fari\~na

**Abstract:** A few years ago, we investigated MYSO G29.862-0.0044 (YSO-G29), an intriguing star-forming region at a distance of 6.2 kpc. Although the typical disc-jet scenario was proposed to explain the observations, it remained far from conclusive. YSO-G29 was analysed using new observations at near-IR from Gemini-NIFS, at radio continuum (10 GHz) from Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and new continuum (1.3 mm) and molecular line data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The near-IR observations allowed us to detect emission of H2 1-0 S(1) and Br-gamma lines in YSO-G29, which are compatible with excitation and ionization from UV radiation propagating in a highly perturbed ambient. In addition, some evidence of H2 excitation by collisions were found. The ALMA data show the presence of a conspicuous and collimated molecular outflow propagating southwards, while to the north, an extended molecular feature perfectly surrounded by the Ks near-IR emission appears. The continuum emission at 1.3 mm allowed us to better resolve the molecular cores, one of which stands out due to its high temperatures and rich chemical composition. From the JVLA observations, we discovered a compact radio continuum source, a likely compact Hii region or an ionised jet of a massive protostar, located at ~0.7 arcsec (~ 0.02 pc) from the main millimetre core. In this way, we propose a YSO wide binary system. {We can explain the nature of the intriguing near-IR features previously observed: cone-like structures produced by jets/winds of one of the components of the binary system that cleared out the surroundings were disrupted by a molecular outflow probably from the other component. These results complete the picture of what is happening in YSO-G29, and reveal a phenomenon that should be considered when investigating massive star-forming regions.

**Comment:** This paper studies a massive young stellar object (MYSO) and its outflows, focusing on a wide binary system and jet/outflow interactions. While it discusses star formation and outflows, the context is massive star-forming regions, not dwarf galaxies or galaxy-scale outflows. It does not match the core topics closely.

## 12. [Effects of light-mass fermionic dark matter on the equilibrium and stability of white dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10002) <a id="link12"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10002

**Authors:** G. A. Carvalho, J. D. V. Arba\~nil, J. G. Coelho

**Abstract:** White dwarfs (WDs) can be used as laboratories to test strong gravity and high-density regimes, once their equation of state is not so uncertain as the one of neutron stars. This makes them also a useful tool to constrain dark-matter models. In this work, we study dark matter white dwarfs (DMWD) composed of white dwarf matter admixed with fermionic dark matter in a two-fluid general relativistic framework. Dark matter particles are considered to have masses between $0.1-10$ GeV. The equilibrium configurations and stability are derived, showing that the DMWD can be more compact, with masses around 1.3 $M\odot$ and radii around 500 km. The increasing compactness leads to changes in the fundamental modes of radial oscillations ($\sim20\%$ for 0.1 GeV DM), which produce detectable shifts in GW frequencies. The interplay between dark matter and normal matter thus provides a compelling avenue for interpreting deviations in observed WD properties and for placing constraints on DM characteristics through astrophysical observations.

**Comment:** This paper studies the effects of light-mass fermionic dark matter on white dwarfs, including equilibrium, stability, and possible observational signatures. While it involves dark matter and compact objects, it does not focus on dwarf galaxies, satellite systems, or galaxy-scale simulations. The connection to near-field cosmology is weak.

## 13. [Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS): Evolution of the Morphology-Density Relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10285) <a id="link13"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10285

**Authors:** L. J. M. Davies, J. Doan, S. Bellstedt, A. S. G. Robotham, S. Phillipps, C. Wolf, M. Meyer, M. Siudek, S. P. Driver

**Abstract:** Galaxies with different morphological characteristics likely have different evolutionary histories, such that understanding the mechanisms that drive morphological change can provide valuable insights into the galaxy evolution process. These mechanisms largely correlate with local environment, ultimately leading to the well-known local morphology-density relation. To explore how the morphology-density relation is produced, we must look to earlier times, and trace the co-evolution of environment and morphology in an un-biased and self-consistent manner. Here we use new environmental metrics from the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) to explore the spectroscopic morphology-density relation at intermediate redshift (0.3<0.5) and compare directly to the Galaxy And Mass Assembly Survey (GAMA) at 0<0.08. Importantly, both the galaxy morphologies and environmental metrics in DEVILS and GAMA are derived in a very similar manner, reducing any methodology biases. We see a clear evolution in morphological classes between DEVILS and GAMA, which is modulated by environment. These trends are consistent with a scenario where in all environments disk-dominated galaxies are transitioning to classical bulge+disk systems (potentially via minor mergers and/or secular evolution), and in high-density environments there is an increasing prevalence of visually-selected elliptical galaxies (potentially via major mergers and/or disk fading); with the fraction of ellipticals increasing by ~0.3 in the most dense regions over the last ~7Gyr, but remaining largely unchanged in low-density environments.

**Comment:** This paper studies the evolution of the morphology-density relation in galaxies using DEVILS and GAMA surveys. While it discusses galaxy evolution and environmental effects, it does not focus on dwarf galaxies, satellite quenching, or resolved star formation histories. The focus is on general galaxy populations and morphology, not the specific core topics.

## 14. [Teaching LLMs to Speak Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10075) <a id="link14"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10075

**Authors:** Nesar Ramachandra, Yuan-Sen Ting, Zechang Sun, Azton Wells, Salman Habib

**Abstract:** Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized text processing, yet adapting Transformer-based neural networks to non-textual scientific modalities typically requires specialized architectures and extensive computational resources. We demonstrate that LLaMA-3.1-8B can be efficiently repurposed to predict galaxy redshifts from spectroscopic data through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), achieving competitive performance while preserving its linguistic capabilities. Using only 16 GPU-hours and adapting 0.04% of model parameters, our approach achieves a mean absolute error of 0.04 in redshift prediction while retaining over 85% of performance on AstroBench and 89% on general QA tasks from eval-harness. This minimal-effort adaptation--requiring only simple standard fine-tuning APIs--lowers barriers to entry for domain scientists and enables integrated agentic workflows where a single model handles both spectroscopic data for quantitative analysis and natural language for reasoning.

**Comment:** This paper adapts LLMs for spectroscopic redshift prediction. While it is a methodological advance for data analysis, it does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

## 15. [Toward High-Precision Astrometry with CSST Using Multi-Gaussian Fitting of PSF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10329) <a id="link15"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10329

**Authors:** Jialu Nie, Peng Wei, Zihuang Cao, Yibo Yan, Chao Liu, Hao Tian, Xin Zhang, Haijun Tian

**Abstract:** The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) presents significant potential for high-precision astrometry. In this study, we show that the point spread function (PSF) modeled by the discrete PSF with Multi-Gaussian function can effectively enhance the astrometric accuracy. We determine that the PSF profile can be accurately modeled by three Gaussians, which takes advantage of reduced computational complexity in PSF convolution. In sparse star fields, the lowest centering accuracy we obtain after aberration correction can be below 1 mas. We find that the proper motion errors remain below 1.0 mas/yr for point sources with five observations and approximately 0.8 mas/yr for seven observations with a time baseline of around 3.5 years. We finally demonstrate that the precision of our position measurements for stars fainter than 21 mag in the simulated CSST crowded field is better than the results from both SExtractor and DOLPHOT.

**Comment:** This paper presents a method for high-precision astrometry using the CSST, focusing on PSF modeling and measurement accuracy. While high-precision astrometry is important for many fields, this work does not directly address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

Chen, Alex Drlica-Wagner, Peter S. Ferguson, Kenneth Herner, Gautham Narayan, Erik R. Peterson, Liana Rauf, Armin Rest, Adam G. Riess, Masao Sako, Brian Schmidt, Xianzhe TZ Tang, Brad E. Tucker

**Abstract:** Precise measurements of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at low redshifts ($z$) serve as one of the most viable keys to unlocking our understanding of cosmic expansion, isotropy, and growth of structure. The Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernovae (DEBASS) program will deliver the largest uniformly calibrated low-$z$ SN Ia data set in the southern hemisphere to date. DEBASS utilizes the Dark Energy Camera to image supernovae in conjunction with the Wide-Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) to gather comprehensive host galaxy information. By using the same photometric instrument as both the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey, DEBASS not only benefits from a robust photometric pipeline and well-calibrated images across the southern sky, but can replace the historic and external low-$z$ samples that were used in the final DES supernova analysis. DEBASS has accumulated more than 400 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia in the redshift range of $0.01<0.08$ from 2021 to mid-2025, and, in this paper along with a companion paper Acevedo et al. submitted, we present an early data release of 77 SNe within the DES footprint to demonstrate the merit and constraining power of the data set. Here, we introduce the DEBASS program, discuss its scientific goals and the advantages it offers for supernova cosmology, and present our initial results. With this early data release, we find a robust median absolute standard deviation of Hubble diagram residuals of $\sim$0.10 mag and an initial measurement of the host-galaxy mass step of $0.06\pm0.04$ mag, both before performing bias corrections. This low scatter shows the promise of a low-$z$ SN Ia program with a well-calibrated telescope and high signal-to-noise ratio across multiple bands.

**Comment:** This paper describes a new supernova survey for cosmology, focusing on Type Ia supernovae and host galaxy properties. While it is relevant to cosmology, it does not match any of the specific criteria (near-field cosmology, resolved SFH, quenching, etc.), as it does not focus on dwarf galaxies, star formation histories, or CGM.

## 17. [Precision Measurement of Large Shear Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10319) <a id="link17"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10319

**Authors:** Jiarui Sun, Jun Zhang, Li Cui, Alessandro Sonnenfeld, Xin Wang

**Abstract:** So far, estimators of galaxy shape distortions are only carefully studied perturbatively in the case of small shear signals, mainly for weak lensing sciences. However, in the neighborhood of massive foreground clusters, a large number of background galaxies can be significantly distorted. The measurement of such large shear signals could be quite nontrivial under general observing conditions, i.e., in the presence of the point spread function (PSF) and noise. In this work, we propose a non-perturbative method to exactly recover large shear signals ($\gtrsim 0.5$) under general conditions. We test the method on simulated galaxy images, and find that it is accurate down to the very faint end.

**Comment:** This paper presents a method for measuring large shear signals in galaxy images, relevant for strong lensing near massive clusters. While it deals with galaxy shape distortions, the focus is on massive clusters and lensing, not on dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

## 18. [The explosion jets of the core-collapse supernova remnant Circinus X-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10843) <a id="link18"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10843

**Authors:** Noam Soker (Technion, Israel), Muhammad Akashi (Technion, Israel)

**Abstract:** We propose that the recently analyzed opposite rings in the Circinus X-1 (Cir X-1) core collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant resulted from a pair of opposite jets at the final phases of the jet-driven explosion process of the progenitor of Cir X-1. We point out the similarity of the rings in the Cir X-1 CCSN remnant to a ring in the Cygnus Loop CCSN remnant. While the X-ray binary system Cir X-1 actively launches jets, no such activity exists in the Cygnus Loop. In both CCSN remnants, we attribute the rings to jets that are part of the explosion process in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We also identify such a ring in the CCSN remnant 107.7-5.1, which we also attribute to exploding jets. We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of late jets inside an exploding massive stellar core, and demonstrate the feasibility of this scenario for ring formation. The Cir X-1 CCSN remnant has a large blowout, similar to that of the Cygnus Loop and to a large protrusion in the CCSN remnant G0.9+0.1 . Based on these similarities, we suggest that other exploding jets inflated the blowout of the Cir X-1 nebula, identical to an earlier claim on the formation of the blowout of the Cygnus Loop. We identify a point-symmetric structure in the Cir X-1 CCSN remnant, strengthening the JJEM. This study further demonstrates that the JJEM is a successful explosion mechanism to analyze CCSNe and CCSN remnants.

**Comment:** This paper presents hydrodynamical simulations of jets in core-collapse supernova remnants, focusing on the Circinus X-1 remnant. While it involves galaxy-scale phenomena, the focus is on supernova remnants and jet-driven explosions, not on dwarf galaxies, star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

## 19. [Signature of the explosion mechanism of Type-Ia SNe in substructures of the remnant: the case of Tycho's SNR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10752) <a id="link19"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10752

**Authors:** Soham Mandal, N\'uria Torres-Alb\`a, Carles Badenes, Shazrene Mohamed

**Abstract:** Type-Ia supernovae (SNe), or runaway thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs (WDs), play a critical role in the chemical evolution of galaxies, and are important cosmological distance indicators due to their 'standardizable' lightcurves. Growing evidence, however, suggests greater diversity in their observed lightcurves (and spectra) than thought previously. This is usually attributed to a variety of WD explosion mechanisms and progenitor system properties, but a direct link between the explosion mechanisms and Type-Ia SN observables remains elusive. Here we present a novel approach to identify explosion mechanisms of Type-Ia SNe, by analyzing the sizes of small-scale turbulent substructures of different elements in their extended ejecta, i.e., in Supernova Remnants (SNRs). Our three-dimensional hydrodynamical models show that substructures in an SNR dominated by iron-group elements may have a typical size different from substructures dominated by intermediate mass elements (e.g., Si, S) in the same SNR. This size difference is governed by the explosion mechanism. Applying this approach to Tycho's SNR, we find that its observed structure is most consistent with the explosion of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass WD via the double-detonation mechanism. Extending this method to other well-characterized SNRs can let us connect the inferred explosion mechanism to the associated historical SNe, which often have spectra reconstructed through light echo observations.

**Comment:** This paper analyzes the explosion mechanisms of Type-Ia supernovae by studying substructures in supernova remnants, using 3D hydrodynamical models. While it involves numerical simulations and stellar explosions, it does not focus on galaxies, star formation histories, or the other core topics. The relevance is low as it is more about supernova physics than galaxy evolution.

## 20. [Time-Dependent Deflection Reconstruction: A New Technique to Search for Gravitational Waves with the Cosmic Microwave Background](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10673) <a id="link20"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10673

**Authors:** Alvin Leluc, Joel Meyers, Alexander van Engelen

**Abstract:** Gravitational waves (GWs) passing through the Earth cause a correlated pattern of time-dependent deflections of the apparent position of astronomical sources. We build upon standard lensing reconstruction techniques to develop a new time-dependent quadratic estimator, providing a novel technique to search for the deflections produced by GWs using observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that the time-dependent deflection reconstruction is many orders of magnitude more sensitive than the ordinary static lensing estimator, and it can be employed with the data collected by existing and future CMB surveys, without requiring any modification to the experimental or survey design. We demonstrate that CMB surveys offer sensitivity to GWs across a broad frequency range: while the sensitivity will not be competitive over the frequency range covered by pulsar timing arrays, it does extend coverage to both lower and higher frequencies. Finally, we discuss how our methods can be extended to search for other time-varying signals, and also how it can be applied to surveys at other wavelengths.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new technique for searching for gravitational waves using CMB observations. While innovative, it does not match any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, dwarf galaxies, or galaxy simulations.

## 21. [Machine learning analysis of Photometric data from the Dark Energy Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10191) <a id="link21"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10191

**Authors:** Elcio Abdalla, Filipe B. Abdalla, Alessandro Marins, Amilcar Queiroz, Rafael M. Ribeiro, Alex S. C. Souza

**Abstract:** In order to retrieve cosmological parameters from photometric surveys, we need to estimate the distribution of the photometric redshift in the sky with excellent accuracy. We use and apply three different machine learning methods to publicly available Dark Energy Survey data release 2 (DR2): a) Artificial Neural Network for photometric redshifts (ANNz2); b) Gaussian processes for photometric redshifts (GPz); and c) Keras, a deep learning application programming interface in Python. We compare these different techniques applied to training data obtained from the VIPERS survey. To deal with the incompleteness of the VIPERS catalogue, we use a space-partitioning data structure (K-d Tree) to estimate the reliability of the obtained photometric redshifts. We build a catalogue which is robust to the lack of training data in certain regions of colour space. We use the photometric data to create maps of overdensity as a function of the redshift distribution for more than 500 million galaxies. These maps split the sky into several onion-like redshift slices, which can be readily used for cosmological parameter estimation. On each angular slice, we create and present maps of the angular distribution of galaxies in that slice as well as an estimate of the redshift distribution, $n(z)$, related to the galaxy distribution of that slice, which is recovered from the redshift estimation methods. We achieve a sub-sample of DES galaxies, which are well matched to the VIPERS sample with an accuracy of the photometric redshifts with a $\sigma_{68}\sim0.035$ and a catastrophic outlier rate of the order of 3 per cent.

**Comment:** This paper applies machine learning to photometric redshift estimation and galaxy distribution mapping in the Dark Energy Survey. While it deals with galaxy surveys, it does not focus on dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, or other core topics.

## 22. [Primordial Black Hole Formation and Spin in Matter Domination Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10070) <a id="link22"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10070

**Authors:** Weitao Ye, Yungui Gong, Tomohiro Harada, Zhaofeng Kang, Kazunori Kohri, Daiki Saito, Chul-Moon Yoo

**Abstract:** In this article, we calculate the mass distribution of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the matter-dominated (MD) era by the peak theory. We apply the Zel'dovich approximation to track the nonlinear evolution of overdensities and compute the PBH abundance and mass function by incorporating a PBH formation criterion based on the hoop conjecture. We find that the PBH abundance $\beta$ follows the scaling law $\beta \simeq A_\gamma \sigma_h^{*5}$ for $\sigma_h^*\ll 1$. Here, $\sigma_h^*$ is the quantity that characterizes the variance of the density fluctuation at the horizon entry. We also find that, in contrast to the previous estimates, the PBH spin is very small for $\sigma_h^*\ll 1$ but could be larger for larger $\sigma_h^*$ and broader power spectra. Finally, specializing to a monochromatic power spectrum, we prove analytically that the PBH mass distribution becomes effectively monochromatic and reveal that the resultant PBH abundance is approximately 19 times the previous prediction.

**Comment:** This paper revisits primordial black hole formation and spin in the matter-dominated era, focusing on early universe structure formation and black hole mass functions. While it discusses small-scale structure, it does not address near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, or galaxy simulations.

## 23. [The Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernova Program: Cross Calibration, Simulations, and Cosmology Forecasts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10877) <a id="link23"></a>

**Abstract:** Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been essential for probing the nature of dark energy; however, most SN analyses rely on the same low-redshift sample, which may lead to shared systematics. In a companion paper (Sherman et al., submitted), we introduce the Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernova (DEBASS) program, which has already collected more than 500 low-redshift SNe Ia on the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), and present an initial release of 77 SNe Ia within the Dark Energy Survey (DES) footprint observed between 2021 and 2024. Here, we examine the systematics, including photometric calibration and selection effects. We find agreement at the 10 millimagnitude level among the tertiary standard stars of DEBASS, DES, and Pan-STARRS1. Our simulations reproduce the observed distributions of DEBASS SN light-curve properties, and we measure a bias-corrected Hubble residual scatter of $0.08$ mag, which, while small, is found in 10% of our simulations. We compare the DEBASS SN distances to the Foundation sample and find consistency with a median residual offset of $0.016 \pm 0.019$ mag. Selection effects have negligible impacts on distances, but a different photometric calibration solution shifts the median residual $-0.015 \pm 0.019$ mag, highlighting calibration sensitivity. Using conservative simulations, we forecast that replacing historical low-redshift samples with the full DEBASS sample (>400 SNe Ia) will improve the statistical uncertainties on dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$ by 30% and 24% respectively, enhance the dark energy Figure of Merit by up to 60%, and enable a measurement of $f\sigma_8$ at the 25% level.

**Comment:** This paper describes a new low-redshift Type Ia supernova sample and its use for cosmological parameter estimation. While it involves supernovae and cosmology, it does not address near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations. The relevance is low.

## 24. [Constraints on the progenitor and explosion of SN 2024ggi in harmony with pre-explosion detection and hydrodynamic simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10573) <a id="link24"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10573

**Authors:** Amar Aryan, Erin Higgins, Matt Nicholl, Ting-Wan Chen, Yu-Hsuan Liu

**Abstract:** Supernova (SN) 2024ggi is a nearby Type II SN discovered by ATLAS, showing early flash-ionization features. The pre-explosion images reveal a red supergiant (RSG) progenitor with an initial mass of 10-17 M$_\odot$. In the present work, we perform detailed hydrodynamic modeling to refine and put robust constraints on the progenitor and explosion parameters of SN 2024ggi. Among the progenitor models in our study, the pre-SN properties of the 11 M$_{\odot}$ match the pre-explosion detected progenitor well. However, we find it difficult to completely rule out the 10 M$_{\odot}$ and 12 M$_{\odot}$ models. Thus, we provide a constraint of 11$^{+1}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ on the initial mass of the progenitor. To match the observed bolometric light curve and velocity evolution of SN 2024ggi, the favored model with an initial mass of 11 M$_{\odot}$ has a pre-SN radius of 800 R$_{\odot}$ and requires an explosion energy of [0.7-0.8]$\times$10$^{51}$ erg, nickel mass of $\lesssim$0.055 M$_{\odot}$, ejecta mass of 9.1 M$_{\odot}$, and an amount of $\sim$ 0.5 M$_{\odot}$ of steady-wind CSM extended up to $\sim1.2\times10^{14}$ cm resulting from an eruptive mass-loss rate of 1.0 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We also incorporate the accelerated-wind CSM scenario which suggests a mass-loss rate of 1.0$\times10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a CSM mass of $\sim$ 0.7 M$_{\odot}$ extended up to $\sim1.1\times10^{14}$ cm. This mass-loss rate falls within the range constrained observationally. Additionally, due to the constraint of 11$^{+1}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ on the initial mass, the range of pre-SN radius and ejecta mass would be [690-900] R$_{\odot}$, and [8.2-9.6] M$_{\odot}$, respectively.

**Comment:** This paper uses hydrodynamic modeling to constrain the progenitor and explosion parameters of a Type II supernova (SN 2024ggi). While it involves stellar evolution and supernova modeling, it does not present new stellar models or address the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

## 25. [Arecibo Wow! II: Revised Properties of the Wow! Signal from Archival Ohio SETI Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10657) <a id="link25"></a>

**Abstract:** The Wow! Signal, detected in 1977 by the Ohio State University SETI project, remains one of the most intriguing unexplained radio transients. The most recent significant revision of its properties took place in the late 1990s; however, further advances were limited by readily available data from this event. Here we retrieved and analyzed decades of previously unpublished Ohio SETI observations, enabling the most comprehensive re-evaluation of the properties of the Wow! Signal to date with modern methods. Our results reveal significant revisions to its parameters that may help explain why its source has been so difficult to identify. We refine its potential origin to two adjacent fields centered on the right ascension $\alpha=19^{\mathrm h}25^{\mathrm m}02^{\mathrm s} \pm 3^{\mathrm s}$ or $19^{\mathrm h}27^{\mathrm m}55^{\mathrm s} \pm 3^{\mathrm s}$, and the declination $\delta=-26^{\deg}57' \pm 20'$ (J2000), a location both narrower and slightly displaced from earlier estimates. We measure a higher peak flux density exceeding 250 Jy and a frequency of $1420.726 \pm 0.005$ MHz, implying a galactic source with a substantially higher radial velocity than previously assumed. Our analysis provides additional support for the hypothesis that the Wow! Signal most likely had an astrophysical origin rather than being attributed to radio interference. In particular, we confirm that small, cold HI clouds can produce narrowband signals similar to its detection, which might suggest a common origin. These findings provide the most precise constraints to date on the location, intensity, and frequency of the Wow! Signal and offer a new path to identify its origin.

**Comment:** This paper focuses on the re-analysis of the Wow! Signal, a famous radio transient, and discusses its possible astrophysical origin, including HI clouds. However, it does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

Blake, Feng Long, Jane Huang, Mar\'ia Jos\'e Colmenares, Joe Williams, Adrien Houge, Mayank Narang, Miguel Vioque, Michiel Lambrechts, L. Ilsedore Cleeves, Karin \"Oberg, the JDISCS collaboration

**Abstract:** The influx of icy pebbles to the inner regions of protoplanetary disks constitutes a fundamental ingredient in most planet formation theories. The observational determination of the magnitude of this pebble flux and its dependence on disk substructure (disk gaps as pebble traps) would be a significant step forward. In this work we analyze a sample of 21 T Tauri disks (with ages $\approx 0.5{-}2\mathrm{~Myr}$) using JWST/MIRI spectra homogeneously reduced with the JDISCS pipeline and high-angular-resolution ALMA continuum data. We find that the 1500/6000 K water line flux ratio measured with JWST - a tracer of cold water vapor and pebble drift near the snowline - correlates with the radial location of the innermost dust gap in ALMA continuum observations (ranging from 8.7 to 69 au), confirming predictions from recent models that study connections between the inner and outer disk reservoirs. We develop a population synthesis exploration of pebble drift in gapped disks and find a good match to the observed trend for early and relatively effective gaps, while scenarios where pebble drift happens quickly, gaps are very leaky, or where gaps form late are disfavored on a population level. Inferred snowline pebble mass fluxes (ranging between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-3}~M_\oplus/\mathrm{yr}$ depending on gap position) are comparable to fluxes used in pebble accretion studies and those proposed for the inner Solar System, while system-to-system variations suggest differences in the emerging planetary system architectures and water budgets.

**Comment:** This paper investigates the flow of water and pebble drift in protoplanetary disks, using JWST and ALMA data. While it involves disk substructure and planet formation, it does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10094

**Authors:** Benedikt Schosser, Caroline Heneka, Bj\"orn Malte Sch\"afer

**Abstract:** Modern machine learning techniques can unlock the vast cosmological information encoded in forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observations. We show that tomographic 21 cm data from the reionisation era can yield stringent tests of inflationary models - here illustrated with Starobinsky $R+R^2$ inflation. Using a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework, we compare neural summaries (convolutional network and vision transformer) with a traditional power spectrum summary and perform a fully joint SBI analysis combining 21 cm data with data of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Forecasts based on realistic mock observations indicate that SKA alone will achieve constraints competitive with Planck, and that the combined SKA + CMB dataset will tighten bounds on both inflationary and $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ parameters considerably while improving precision on key astrophysical quantities.

**Comment:** This paper focuses on cosmological constraints from SKA 21 cm and CMB data, specifically targeting inflationary models. While it uses advanced simulation-based inference and discusses astrophysical parameter constraints, it does not directly address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, dwarf galaxy properties, or galaxy simulations. The focus is on early universe cosmology and inflation, which is outside the specified interests.

## 28. [Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10514) <a id="link28"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10514

**Authors:** Himanshu Chaudhary, Salvatore Capozziello, Vipin Kumar Sharma, Isidro G\'omez-Vargas, G. Mustafa

**Abstract:** We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. The analysis reveals that the matter density parameter, $\Omega_m$, changes with redshift, and this change is significantly influenced by the LRG1 datapoint from the DESI DR2 survey. We find that including LRG1 strongly affects the predictions of these models, especially for $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_0$, with the latter shifting from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 datapoint. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0>-1$, $\omega_a<0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a<-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.

**Comment:** This paper investigates evolving dark energy using large-scale structure and supernova data. While it is cosmological, it does not focus on near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, or any of the other core topics.

**Authors:** Shubham Barua, Shantanu Desai, Mauricio Lopez-Hernandez, Eoin \'O Colg\'ain

**Abstract:** We study frequentist confidence intervals based on graphical profile likelihoods (Wilks' theorem, likelihood integration), and the Feldman-Cousins (FC) prescription, a generalisation of the Neyman belt construction, in a setting with non-Gaussian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posteriors. Our simplified setting allows us to recycle the MCMC chain as an input in all methods, including mock simulations underlying the FC approach. We find all methods agree to within $10 \%$ in the close to Gaussian regime, but extending methods beyond their regime of validity leads to greater discrepancies. Importantly, we recover a $\sim 2 \sigma$ shift in cosmological parameters between low and high redshift cosmic chronometer data with the FC method, but only when one fits all parameters back to the mocks. We observe that fixing parameters, a common approach in the literature, risks underestimating confidence intervals.

**Comment:** This paper discusses statistical methods for confidence intervals in non-Gaussian regimes, with some application to cosmological parameter estimation. However, it does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, or galaxy simulations.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10768

**Authors:** Sergey K. Ermakov, Michael Bussmann, Alexander Debus, Richard Pausch, Ulrich Schramm, Ren\'e Widera, Klaus Steiniger

**Abstract:** Magnetic reconnection drives a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, including geomagnetic storms, solar flares, and activity in blazars. However, direct measurement of key reconnection observables remains challenging due to the remote and extreme nature of these environments. While high-energy particle showers observed on Earth are often attributed to reconnection, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and clear diagnostic signatures are lacking. We present a theoretical, data-driven approach for identifying reconnection radiation signatures and enabling remote diagnostics of reconnection in astrophysical settings through radiation spectra. Using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of magnetic reconnection, we generate radiation spectra and establish connections between spectral features and the underlying reconnection dynamics. We develop a method to estimate the ratio of the reconnection electric field to the plasmoid magnetic field from spectral data. Analytic calculations show that other parameters can be extracted in the ultra-relativistic reconnection regime, such as the magnetic field or the current sheet width.

**Comment:** This paper presents a theoretical approach to identifying radiative signatures of magnetic reconnection in astrophysical environments using PIC simulations. It does not match any of the core criteria, as it focuses on reconnection physics rather than galaxy evolution, star formation, or CGM.

**Abstract:** In this paper we investigate quark deconfinement in neutrons stars and their mergers, focusing on the effects of higher orders for the phase transition between hadronic and quark matter. The different descriptions we use to describe matter microscopically contain varying particle degrees of freedom, including nucleons, hyperons, Delta baryons, and light and strange quarks. We use tabulated equations of state from the CompOSE database in which the quark deconfinement phase transition is described as being first-order, and then smooth it out by introducing a percolation, replacing the single first-order phase transition with two transitions of second or third order. We then perform binary neutron-star merger simulations using these new equations of st ate, focusing on groups of binaries with the same single-star mass, radius, and tidal deformability, but different equations of state. We go on to discuss differences in their evolution, and the ramifications for interpreting future gravitational wave observations and the potential to learn about dense matter.

**Abstract:** (Abridged) The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way exhibits extreme conditions, including high gas densities, elevated temperatures, enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rates, and large-scale dynamics. Large-scale molecular surveys reveal increasing chemical and physical complexity in the CMZ. A key step to interpreting the molecular richness found in the CMZ is to build chemical templates tailored to its diverse conditions. The combined impact of high ionization, elevated temperatures, and dense gas remains insufficiently explored for observable tracers. In this study, we utilized UCLCHEM, a gas-grain time-dependent chemical model, to link physical conditions with their corresponding molecular signatures and identify key tracers of temperature, density, ionization, and shock activity. We ran a grid of models of shocks and protostellar objects representative of typical CMZ conditions, focusing on twenty-four species, including complex organic molecules. Shocked and protostellar environments show distinct evolutionary timescales ($\lesssim 10^4$ vs. $\gtrsim 10^4$ years), with 300 K emerging as a key temperature threshold for chemical differentiation. We find that cosmic-ray ionization and temperature are the main drivers of chemical trends. HCO$^+$, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$SH trace ionization, while HCO, HCO$^+$, CH$_3$SH, CH$_3$NCO, and HCOOCH$_3$ show consistent abundance contrasts between shocks and protostellar regions over similar temperature ranges. While our models underpredict some complex organics in shocks, they reproduce observed trends for most species, supporting scenarios involving recurring shocks in Galactic Center clouds and enhanced ionization towards Sgr B2(N2). Future work should assess the role of shock recurrence and metallicity in shaping chemistry.

**Comment:** This paper models chemical tracers in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way, focusing on shock and protostellar chemistry under Galactic Center conditions. The focus is on the Galactic Center, which is explicitly listed as irrelevant. No direct connection to dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, or CGM.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10665

**Authors:** Yonghua Wang, Wei Chao

**Abstract:** Since the first detection of gravitational waves by ground-based interferometers, it has emerged as a novel probe for exploring physics in the early universe. The particle nature of cold dark matter (DM) and its underlying production mechanisms remain long-standing unresolved issues in the field. Notably, if DM is generated through the freeze-in mechanism in the early universe, direct laboratory detection becomes extraordinarily challenging due to its extremely weak coupling with standard model particles. In this study, we calculate the graviton bremsstrahlung process involved in the freeze-in production of dark matter, deriving the gravitational wave spectra for both the conventional freeze-in mechanism and ultraviolet freeze-in scenarios. Our analysis reveals that these spectra exhibit distinct characteristics, though they fall beyond the detection limits of currently proposed gravitational wave experiments. However, advancements in high-frequency gravitational wave detection technologies in the future may offer a means to indirectly probe the ultraviolet freeze-in mechanism.

**Comment:** This paper calculates gravitational wave spectra from dark matter production via the freeze-in mechanism. It is focused on early universe physics and dark matter, not on galaxies, star formation histories, or the other core topics.

## 34. [Tracing the Physical Lineage of GRB 211211A: Population Constraints on NS-WD Merger Gamma-Ray Bursts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10551) <a id="link34"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10551

**Authors:** Xiao-Tian Xu, Bin-Bin Zhang, Yun-Lang Guo, Xiang-Dong Li

**Abstract:** The peculiar long gamma-ray burst (GRB) event, GRB 211211A, is known for it is association with a kilonova feature. Whereas most long GRBs are thought to originate in the core collapse of massive stars, the presence of kilonova suggests GRB 211211A was instead produced by a merger of a compact object binary. Building on the interpretation put forward by \citet{Yang2022Natur.612..232Y}--who argue that GRB 211211A was powered by a massive white-dwarf + neutron-star (WD-NS) merger--we adopt this WD-NS scenario as our observationally supported starting point. If the burst truly originates from that channel, its rarity must mirror the formation and merger rate of WD-NS binaries--a rate still largely unexplored in conventional massive-binary population studies. In this letter, we present a qualitative analysis based on binary evolution physics in order to understand the fraction of GRB 211211A in short GRBs (NS-WD/NS-NS fraction). Since the progenitors of massive WD-NS binaries occupy the initial mass function-preferred regime, where the zero-age main-sequence mass range of the assumed WD mass range (1.2-1.4$\,M_\odot$) is comparable to that of NSs, the NS-WD/NS-NS fraction emerging from our standard evolutionary path is expected to be $\sim$14--37\%, far higher than the observed fraction ($\sim5$\%). This discrepancy might imply a large, still-unidentified population of GRB 211211A-like events or an unusual origin of the NS-such as being hypernova-born or accretion-induced-collapse-born. Placing these results in a broader compact-binary context, implications for black-hole systems are also discussed.

**Comment:** This paper studies the population of gamma-ray bursts from neutron star-white dwarf mergers, focusing on the rates and evolutionary channels. While it involves binary evolution and compact objects, it does not address the core topics of near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

## 35. [Benchmark of the Fe XXV R ratio in photoionized plasma during eclipse of Centaurus X-3 with XRISM/Resolve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10441) <a id="link35"></a>

**Authors:** Yuto Mochizuki, Masahiro Tsujimoto, Maurice A. Leutenegger, Liyi Gu, Ralf Ballhausen, Ehud Behar, Paul A. Draghis, Natalie Hell, Pragati Pradhan

**Abstract:** The R ratio is a useful diagnostic of the X-ray emitting astrophysical plasmas defined as the intensity ratio of the forbidden over the inter-combination lines in the K$\alpha$ line complex of He-like ions. The value is altered by excitation processes (electron impact or UV photoexcitation) from the metastable upper level of the forbidden line, thereby constraining the electron density or UV field intensity. The diagnostic has been applied mostly in electron density constraints in collisionally ionized plasmas using low-Z elements as was originally proposed for the Sun (Gabriel & Jordan (1969a, MNRAS, 145, 241)), but it can also be used in photoionized plasmas. To make use of this diagnostic, we need to know its value in the limit of no excitation of metastables (R$_0$), which depends on the element, how the plasmas are formed, how the lines are propagated, and the spectral resolution affecting line blending principally with satellite lines from Li-like ions. We benchmark R$_0$ for photoionized plasmas by comparing calculations using radiative transfer codes and observation data taken with the Resolve X-ray microcalorimter onboard XRISM. We use the Fe XXV He$\alpha$ line complex of the photo-ionized plasma in Centaurus X-3 observed during eclipse, in which the plasma is expected to be in the limit of no metastable excitation. The measured R$ = 0.65 \pm 0.08$ is consistent with the value calculated using xstar for the plasma parameters derived from other line ratios of the spectrum. We conclude that the R ratio diagnostic can be used for high-$Z$ elements such as Fe in photoionized plasmas, which has wide applications in plasmas around compact objects at various scales.

**Comment:** This paper focuses on X-ray diagnostics of photoionized plasmas around a compact object (Centaurus X-3). It does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations. The work is more relevant to high-energy astrophysics and plasma diagnostics.

**Authors:** Rodrigo Angulo, Armin Rest, William P. Blair, Jacob Jencson, David A. Coulter, Qinan Wang, Ryan J. Foley, Charles D. Kilpatrick, Xiaolong Li, Anthony L. Piro

**Abstract:** Difference image analysis (DIA) is a powerful tool for studying time-variable phenomena, and has been used by many time-domain surveys. Most DIA algorithms involve matching the spatially-varying PSF shape between science and template images, and then convolving that shape in one image to match the other. The wrong choice of which image to convolve can introduce one of the largest sources of artifacts in the final difference image. We introduce a quantitative metric to determine the optimal convolution direction that depends not only on the sharpness of the images measured by their FWHM, but also on their exposure depths. With this metric, the optimal convolution direction can be determined a priori, depending only on the FWHM and depth of the images. This not only simplifies the process, but also makes it more robust and less prone to creating sub-optimal difference images due to the wrong choice of the convolution direction. As an additional benefit, for a large set of images, we define a Figure-of-Merit based on this metric, which allows us to rank a list of images and determine the ones best suited to be used as templates, thus streamlining and automating the data reduction process.

**Comment:** This paper presents improvements to difference image analysis, a data reduction technique for time-domain astronomy. While useful for observational astronomy, it does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

**Abstract:** The Europa Clipper mission will arrive at the Jovian system in 2030 and analyze ice grains sourced from the icy material on its surface using impact mass spectrometry, which will provide key constraints on Europa's chemical composition and habitability. However, deriving quantitative compositional information from spaceborne impact mass spectra of ice grains has historically proven difficult due to the confounding effects of composition and impact velocity, coupled with difficulties in accelerating ice grains to spacecraft velocities under analogous sampling conditions. Using a novel hypervelocity ice grain acceleration and impact mass spectrometry method, we quantify the degree to which the mass spectra of NaCl-rich ice grains are influenced by chemical composition and impact velocity variations within the flyby velocity ranges planned for the Europa Clipper mission. These results suggest that high-fidelity studies quantifying composition and velocity-related effects in impact mass spectra may be necessary to accurately interpret data collected at Europa and other ocean worlds in the future.

**Authors:** Huei-Ru Vivien Chen, Qizhou Zhang, Tao-Chung Ching, H. Beuther, Kuo-Song Wang

**Abstract:** We present polarization maps of dust emission at 340 GHz in the luminous high-mass protocluster, W3 IRS5, observed with the Submillimeter Array. The projected magnetic fields appear fairly organized with a pinched morphology in the northern part and a concave shape in the southern part. We fit the polarization maps with a two-component magnetic field model: an hourglass model centered at the continuum peak, SMM2, and an empirical sphere centered at the O-type star, IRS7. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we calculate a projected field strength of $B_\mathrm{pos} = 1.4 \; \mathrm{mG}$. Along with the Zeeman measurement, a total magnetic field strength of $B_\mathrm{tot} = 1.6 \; \mathrm{mG}$ is obtained. We find that the gravitational energy is the most dominant, followed by magnetic energy, and then turbulent energy. Small values of the virial parameter, $\alpha_\mathrm{vir} = 0.8$, and the ratio of timescales, $t_\mathrm{ff}/t_\mathrm{corss} = 0.6$, suggest an ongoing collapse. We also show collimated molecular outflows in the $\mathrm{CO \; (3-2)}$ and $\mathrm{SiO \; (8-7)}$ transitions. The morphology of magnetic fields and the surrounding \HII regions put forward a scenario for W3 IRS5. A gravitationally unstable dense core formed within a neutral gas ridge plowed by the expansions of W3 A and W3 B. The core began to contract, causing gravity to pull the magnetic field lines inward, which resulted in a pinched field morphology. Subsequent expansion of W3 F, ionized by IRS7, perturbed the magnetic field, creating concave patterns. The dynamical interactions among protostars led to misalignment of their outflows.

**Comment:** This paper presents observations of magnetic fields and outflows in a high-mass protocluster (W3 IRS5). The focus is on massive star formation, not on dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy-scale outflows relevant to the core topics.

## 39. [The X-ray Source Population of the Metal-Rich Globular Cluster NGC 6528](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10105) <a id="link39"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10105

**Authors:** Bernard Leal, Kwangmin Oh, Jay Strader, Steve E. Zepf, Kristen Dage, S. Kim, C. Y. Hui

**Abstract:** We present the first study of the X-ray sources in one of the most metal-rich globular clusters in the Galaxy, NGC 6528. Using relatively deep (66 ksec) archival imaging from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we identify 18 sources within the half-light radius of the cluster, all in the range $L_X \sim 10^{31}$-$10^{32}$erg s$^{-1}$ (0.5-7 keV). By combining these data with photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope and other sources, we classify the X-ray sources as a likely mix of cataclysmic variables and active binaries, though one or more of the brighter objects could be a quiescent low-mass X-ray binary. For this cluster, it appears that the X-ray binary-enhancing effects of high metallicity are outweighed by the cluster's advanced dynamical evolution, leading to a relatively modest X-ray source population.

**Comment:** This paper studies X-ray sources in a metal-rich globular cluster (NGC 6528). While it deals with stellar populations and binaries, it does not focus on dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, quenching, or galaxy simulations. Globular clusters are not the main focus of near-field cosmology as defined here.

## 40. [Ultra-luminous X-ray pulsars as sources of TeV neutrinos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10487) <a id="link40"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10487

**Authors:** L. Ducci, E. Perinati, P. Romano, S. Vercellone, M. Niko{\l}ajuk, A. Santangelo, M. Sasaki

**Abstract:** We explored the expected properties of the neutrino emission from accreting neutron stars in X-ray binaries using numerical simulations. The simulations are based on a model in which neutrinos are produced by the decay of charged pions and kaons, generated in inelastic collisions between protons accelerated up to TeV energies in the magnetosphere of a magnetized (B~1E12 G) neutron star and protons of the accretion disc. Our results show that this process can produce strong neutrino emission up to a few tens of TeV when the X-ray luminosity is above ~1E39 erg/s, as in ultra-luminous X-ray (ULX) pulsars. We show that neutrinos from a transient Galactic ULX pulsar with L_x ~ 5E39 erg/s can be detected with kilometre-scale detectors such as IceCube if the source is within about 3-4 kpc. We also derived an upper limit on the neutrino flux from the Galactic ULX pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 using IceCube data, a result that has not been previously reported. Our findings establish a new benchmark for future astrophysical neutrino observations, critical for interpreting data from current and upcoming instruments with significantly improved sensitivity.

## 41. [An automated, self-calibration based pipeline for high-fidelity solar imaging with LOFAR: SIMPL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10619) <a id="link41"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10619

**Authors:** Soham Dey, Divya Oberoi, Pietro Zucca, Mattia Mancini, Deepan Patra, Devojyoti Kansabanik

**Abstract:** The LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) is capable of imaging spectroscopy of the Sun in the 10-240 MHz frequency range, with high spectral, temporal, and spatial resolution. However, the complex and rapidly varying nature of solar radio emission - spanning several orders of magnitude in brightness further exacerbated by the strong ionospheric phase distortions during daytime observations, poses major challenges for calibration, imaging, and automation. We aim to develop a fully automated, high-fidelity imaging pipeline optimized for LOFAR solar observations, capable of handling the intrinsic variability of solar emission and producing science-ready images with minimal human intervention. We have built the Solar Imaging Pipeline for LOFAR (SIMPL), which integrates excision of radio-frequency interference (RFI) for the solar-specific scenarios, calibration strategies, and self-calibration. The pipeline is designed to enable scalable and uniform processing of large archival datasets. SIMPL achieves more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in imaging dynamic range compared to previous efforts and reliably produces high-quality spectroscopic snapshot images. It has been tested across a wide range of solar conditions. It is currently being employed to process a decade of LOFAR solar observations, providing science-ready FITS images for the community and enabling both comprehensive and novel studies of solar radio phenomena -- ranging from quiet Sun emission and faint non-thermal features to active regions and their associated dynamic events, such as transient bursts.

## 42. [Leptogenesis and neutrino mass with one right-handed neutrino and Higgs inflaton](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10103) <a id="link42"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10103

**Authors:** Disha Bandyopadhyay, Debasish Borah, Suruj Jyoti Das, Nobuchika Okada

**Abstract:** We propose a novel and minimal setup where the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe and neutrino oscillation data can be satisfied with only one right-handed neutrino (RHN) and a second Higgs doublet with the latter being also responsible for driving cosmic inflation. While inflation is realised via non-minimal coupling of the Higgs to gravity, baryon asymmetry is generated via Affleck-Dine leptogenesis. Due to the presence of only two new fields beyond the standard model (BSM), the proposed setup remains very predictive with only a small allowed parameter space consistent with the PLANCK 2018 and ACT 2025 data simultaneously. The preferred mass spectrum of the BSM particles also keeps the detection prospects alive at terrestrial experiments.

**Comment:** This paper discusses baryon asymmetry and neutrino mass generation in the early universe, with a focus on particle physics and cosmology. It does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

## 43. [Parity violation in framework of nonmetricity gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10532) <a id="link43"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10532

**Authors:** Zhiyuan Yu, Zhengsheng Yang, Taotao Qiu

**Abstract:** The latest observational data of Planck satellite shows nontrivial value of polarization rotation angle caused by cosmic birefringence in the early universe. Moreover, the asymmetry of baryons versus anti-baryons still remains mysterious. Both of them indicates that there should be hidden new physics such as fundamental symmetry breaking. In this paper, we try to interpret these two events in framework of nonmetricity modified gravity. We introduce an interaction term between nonmetricity-based function and matter current, and calculate both the rotation angle and baryon-to-photon ratio. We also constrain the model parameters using the current observational data. With some specific examples, we demonstrate that in nonmetricity gravity theory, these two events can be interpreted in a unified way.

**Comment:** This paper discusses parity violation and baryogenesis in the context of nonmetricity gravity, focusing on early universe physics and fundamental symmetries. It does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

## 44. [Scalar-induced gravitational waves with non-Gaussianity up to all orders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10812) <a id="link44"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10812

**Authors:** Xiang-Xi Zeng, Zhuan Ning, Rong-Gen Cai, Shao-Jiang Wang

**Abstract:** Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) are ubiquitous in many early-Universe processes accompanied by non-Gaussianity; hence, precise calculations of SIGWs involve a full understanding of non-Gaussianity. In this Letter, we propose to use the lattice simulations to directly calculate the energy density spectra of SIGWs with non-Gaussianity up to all orders. Our proposal has been first verified to match the existing semi-analytical results with non-Gaussianity, and then applied to more general cases, including high-order primordial non-Gaussianities, the logarithmic dependence in curvature perturbations, the curvaton model, and the ultra slow-roll model. We find that even a modest non-Gaussianity can significantly alter ultraviolet behaviors in SIGW spectra, necessitating special cautions in future detections as well as mutual constraints on/from primordial black holes.

**Comment:** This paper discusses scalar-induced gravitational waves and non-Gaussianity in the early universe, focusing on primordial cosmology and gravitational wave backgrounds. It does not match any of the specified criteria, as it is not about galaxies, star formation, or near-field cosmology.

**Abstract:** The Faint Object Camera (FOC) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) acquired high-resolution, spatially resolved polarimetric images of nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in the near ultraviolet (near-UV) band. Among the 25 individual targets in the polarized archives, 8 had no published analysis until the beginning of this series of papers. We tackle the last 5 targets in the following. In this paper, we finalize the publication of near-UV imaging polarimetry of AGNs in the HST/FOC archives. We render available spatially resolved polarization maps of the [OIII] emission lines for Mrk 3 and Mrk 78, as well as near-UV continuum polarization maps for Mrk 3, NGC 3862, Cygnus A and 3C 109. We make use of the generalized reduction pipeline presented in the first paper in this series to homogeneously analyze the five remaining polarized observations of AGNs in the FOC archives. In Mrk 3 and Mrk 78, we find a polarization pattern in the narrow-line regions consistent with scattering from an obscured nucleus. For NGC 3862, we confirm marginal UV polarization parallel with the inner radio jet, related to synchrotron emission. In Cygnus A, we report spatially resolved centro-symmetric polarization patterns in both opposite outflows, highlighting the scattering origin of the polarized light. Finally, 3C 109 shows high nuclear polarization, consistent with AGN-dominated emission and parallel with the radio axis, but in tension with polarization arising from dichroic absorption invoked by previous authors. The imaging polarimetry obtained for the narrow-line region and the extended scattering medium surrounding the obscured AGNs is aligned with the predictions of the unified AGN model and demonstrates the power of spatially-resolved polarimetric observation to decipher the complex morphologies at work in AGNs.

**Comment:** This paper analyzes archival HST/FOC UV imaging polarimetry of AGNs. The focus is on AGN structure and polarization, which is not relevant to any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, or galaxy simulations.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10386

**Authors:** Tailong Zhang, Benjamin Wilcock, Sushuang Ma, Giovanna Tinetti, Lawrence Bradley, Marcell Tessenyi, Jonathan Tennyson

**Abstract:** The Twinkle Space Telescope is a satellite designed for spectroscopic observations of a wide range of extrasolar and solar system objects. Equipped with a 0.45 m diameter telescope and a spectrometer covering from 0.5 to 4.5 microns simultaneously, Twinkle will be launched in a sun-synchronous, low-Earth orbit, and it is expected to operate for seven years. Twinkle is developed, managed and operated by Blue Skies Space (BSSL), a space science data company whose vision is to accelerate and expand the availability of new, high-quality datasets to researchers worldwide, complementing the space observatories delivered by government space agencies.   Over its lifetime, Twinkle will conduct large-scale survey programs. The scientific objectives and observational strategy of these surveys are defined by researchers who join the Science Team.   Leveraging advances made possible by recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope, we present here updated simulations evaluating Twinkle's observational capabilities in the context of exoplanet atmospheres. Through retrieval analyses of HD 209458 b, WASP-107 b, GJ 3470 b, and 55 Cnc e, we demonstrate how increasing observational investment enhances the retrieval of atmospheric parameters and molecular abundances. Our sensitivity study highlights Twinkle's capability to detect less abundant or less detectable molecules depending on the observing strategies adopted. This work provides practical guidance for developing targeted observational strategies to maximise Twinkle's scientific return.

**Comment:** This paper focuses on atmospheric characterization of exoplanets using the Twinkle Space Telescope, leveraging JWST advances. It does not match any of the core criteria (near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, quenching, stellar models, galaxy simulations, outflows, or CGM).

## 47. [Forbush Decreases during strong Geomagnetic Storms: Time Delays, Rigidity Effects, and ICME-Driven Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10165) <a id="link47"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10165

**Authors:** O. Ahmed, B. Badruddin, M. Derouich

**Abstract:** We investigate the relationship between Forbush decreases (FDs) and associated geomagnetic storms, and their links to interplanetary solar wind parameters, using high-resolution minute data. FDs are classified by main-phase decrease steps and analyzed with superposed epoch analysis. Fast, turbulent, high-field sheath structures occur before and during coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven FDs, whereas corotating interaction region events show delayed amplification and more perturbed dynamics. Time lags between FD and storm onsets are examined for space weather forecasting. FD amplitude correlates more strongly with moderate and strong CME-driven storms than with extreme storms, likely due to complex magnetospheric responses from successive events and prolonged southward IMF Bz. Events with fast shocks and sheath regions show stronger correlations than those without shocks. Energy dependence, derived from twelve neutron monitor stations worldwide, reveals a two-step linear rigidity spectrum: sharp FD amplitude decrease at low rigidity and a more gradual drop at higher rigidity.

**Comment:** This paper investigates Forbush decreases and geomagnetic storms, focusing on solar wind and cosmic ray modulation. It does not match any of the core criteria related to galaxy evolution, star formation, or CGM.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10330

**Abstract:** Observations of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) at low radio frequencies play an important role in understanding the Galactic pulsar population and characterising both their emission properties and the effects of the ionised interstellar medium on the received signals. To date, only a relatively small fraction of the known MSP population has been detected at frequencies below 300 MHz, and nearly all previous MSP studies at these frequencies have been conducted with northern telescopes. We present a census of MSPs in the SMART pulsar survey, covering declinations south of +30 deg at a centre frequency of 154 MHz. We detected 40 MSPs, with 11 being the first published detections below 300 MHz. For each detection, we provide coherently-dedispersed full-polarimetric integrated pulse profiles and mean flux densities. We measured significant Faraday rotation measures (RMs) for 25 MSPs, and identified apparent phase-dependent RM variations for three MSPs. Comparison with published profiles at other frequencies supports previous studies suggesting that the pulse component separations of MSPs vary negligibly over a wide frequency range due to their compact magnetospheres. We observe that integrated pulse profiles tend to be more polarised at low frequencies, consistent with depolarisation due to superposed orthogonal polarisation modes. The results of this census will be a valuable resource for planning future MSP monitoring projects at low frequencies, and will also help to improve survey simulations to forecast the detectable MSP population with the SKA-Low.

## 49. [Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855) <a id="link49"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10855

**Authors:** Slava G. Turyshev

**Abstract:** This paper presents a rigorous analytical framework for quantitatively evaluating space-based laser power beaming from lunar-orbiting spacecraft to surface receivers, addressing the critical need for continuous, high-density energy to sustain lunar exploration and habitation. The framework integrates physics-based models of spacecraft photovoltaic generation, precise orbital geometries, time-dependent link availability and slant-range variations, coherent beam propagation (including transmitter aperture diameter, beam quality factor, path losses, and pointing jitter), and photonic-to-electrical conversion at the lunar surface. Particular emphasis is placed on phased-array transmitter systems, whose large effective apertures significantly reduce beam divergence relative to single-aperture designs, resulting in orders-of-magnitude increases in delivered surface power under equivalent orbital and power conditions. Parametric sensitivity analyses and illustrative numerical simulations demonstrate how phased-array architectures improve power density and end-to-end efficiency at operational lunar distances. The study also examines advanced orbital configurations (e.g., Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits, Earth-Moon Lagrange points), real-time adaptive beam steering and wavefront control, optimized receiver geometries, and thermal/dust mitigation strategies. The results establish a clear pathway toward scalable, efficient laser power beaming infrastructures capable of overcoming lunar-specific challenges - including prolonged darkness and permanently shadowed regions - and enabling sustained robotic and crewed surface operations.

**Abstract:** The spin-orbit angle between a stellar spin axis and its planetary orbital axis is a key diagnostic of planetary migration pathways, yet the mechanisms shaping the observed spin-orbit distribution remain incompletely understood. Combining the spin-orbit angle with atmospheric measurements has emerged as a powerful method of studying exoplanets that showcases the synergy between ground- and space-based observations. We present the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect measurements of the projected spin-orbit angle ($\lambda$) for three gaseous exoplanets using the newly commissioned PLATOSpec instrument on the E152 Telescope at La Silla Observatory. For WASP-35b, we determine $\lambda = 1_{-18}^{+19}$ deg, demonstrating PLATOSpec's capabilities through excellent agreement with HARPS-N literature data. We provide the first spin-orbit measurements for TOI-622b ($\lambda =-4 \pm 12$ deg, true spin-orbit angle $\psi = $16.1$^{+8.0}_{-9.7}$ deg), revealing an aligned orbit consistent with quiescent disc migration. For K2-237b, we find $\lambda = 91 \pm 7$ deg and $\psi = $90.5$^{+6.8}_{-6.2}$ deg, indicating a nearly perfect polar orbit, which suggests a history consistent with disc-free migration, contrasting previous studies inferring disc migration. TOI-622b populates a sparsely populated region of sub-Jovian planets with measured spin-orbit angles orbiting stars above the Kraft break, while K2-237b's polar configuration strengthens tentative evidence for preferential orbital orientations. All three systems are compelling targets for future atmospheric characterization, where these dynamical constraints will be vital for a comprehensive understanding of their formation and evolution.

**Abstract:** The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a perfect liquid drop at equilibrium is extended to rotating systems with a small frequency $\omega $ within the effective-surface (ES) approach. The gradient surface terms of the NS energy density $\cal{E}(\rho)$ [Equation of State] are taken into account along with the volume ones at the leading order of the leptodermic parameter $a/R << 1$, where $a$ is the ES crust thickness and $R$ is the mean NS radius. The macroscopic NS angular momentum at small frequencies $\omega$ is specified for calculations of the adiabatic moment of inertia (MI) within the Kerr metric coordinate approach in the outer Boyer-Lindquist and inner Hogan forms. The NS MI, $\Theta=\tilde{\Theta}/(1-\cal{G}_{t\varphi})$, was obtained in terms of the statistically averaged MI, $\tilde{\Theta}$, and its time and azimuthal-angle correlation, $\cal{G}_{t\varphi}$, as sums of the volume and surface components. The MI $\Theta$ depends dramatically on its effective radius $R$ because of strong gravitation and surface effects. We found the significant shift of the Schwarzschild radius due to the correlation term $\cal{G}_{t\varphi}$. With this term, the adiabaticity condition fails for the NS J0740+6620, with the mass about $M_\odot$ for a strong gravitation, in contrast to the NS J0030+0451 for smaller mass, and many other NSs.

**Abstract:** The Compton Spectrometer and Imager is an upcoming NASA space telescope in the MeV range. COSI's primary science goals include precisely mapping nuclear line and positron annihilation emission in the Milky Way galaxy through Compton imaging. This relies on our ability to maintain COSI's spectral performance over its mission lifetime. Changes to the detectors' gain characteristics over time will result in a non-linear stretching of the entire energy range. Moreover, observations from past MeV telescopes and proton-beam experiments have shown that radiation damage in space causes photopeak shifts and spectral line broadening. These necessitate a plan for regular, in-orbit calibration. In this study, we demonstrate a method to monitor and recalibrate the COSI detectors using background line emissions produced by the space radiation environment. We employ Monte Carlo simulations of particle background and show that strong background lines arise from nuclear excitation of COSI's detectors (germanium) and cryostat (aluminum) materials. These span COSI's entire bandwidth for single-site interactions and can be used to monitor the effects of radiation damage and gain shifts every eight hours at the full instrument level and every 24 days at the individual detector level. Methods developed by Pike et al. to correct the effects of hole trapping and gain characteristics can then be applied to recover the original spectral performance. These results inform COSI's telemetry requirements for calibration and housekeeping data, and rule out the need for an on-board radioactive calibration source which would have increased the complexity of the spacecraft.

**Comment:** This paper discusses calibration methods for the COSI space telescope, which will map nuclear line and positron annihilation emission in the Milky Way. The focus is on instrumentation and calibration, not on the core science topics such as dwarf galaxies, star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

**Abstract:** Multi-messenger astronomy offers a powerful approach to studying high-energy radiative processes in astrophysical sources. A notable example was seen in 2017, when the IceCube Neutrino Observatory detected a high-energy neutrino event that was found to coincide with a gamma-ray flare from a blazar. Since then, numerous multi-messenger studies combining neutrino and photon data have been conducted, yet the origin of neutrinos from active galactic nuclei (AGN) remains uncertain. In this work, we present the results of an X-ray observing program targeting two AGNs, NGC 1068 and PKS 1502+106. The multi-wavelength dataset includes new observations from NICER and NuSTAR from the observing proposal along with gamma-ray data collected using Fermi-LAT, and one archival observation from Chandra. Additionally, we derive the neutrino fluxes for both AGNs using ten years of IceCube data and neutrino spectra predicted by theoretical models. These results demonstrate the value of combining multi-messenger data in building and constraining theoretical models. They also highlight the importance of testing model predictions against observational data to refine measurements of both the neutrino flux and spectral shape.

**Comment:** This paper presents a multi-wavelength and multi-messenger study of two AGNs, focusing on neutrino and photon emission. It does not match any of the specified criteria, as it is about AGN and not about galaxies, star formation, or near-field cosmology.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10097

**Authors:** J. Michael Shull (University of Colorado), Rongmon Bordoloi (North Carolina State University), Charles W. Danforth (University of Colorado)

**Abstract:** Using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope with both far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) gratings, we measure the ionizing spectra of two bright, intermediate-redshift quasars in their rest-frame extreme ultraviolet (EUV). The availability of both NUV and FUV spectra allows us to define the quasar continuum and correct for strong Lyman-limit systems (LLS) that fall in the gap between the FUV and optical. Each AGN has a prominent LLS, but the flux recovery shortward of their Lyman edges allows us to fit and restore the true AGN continuum. In the EUV (450-912 A) these AGN have flux distributions, $F_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-\alpha_{\nu}}$, with spectral indices $\alpha_{\nu} = 1.11\pm0.22$ (SBS 1010+535, $z_{\rm AGN} = 1.5086$) and $\alpha_{\nu} = 0.98\pm0.22$ (HS 0747+4259, $z_{\rm AGN} = 1.9006$), both considerably harder than the mean index, $\alpha_{\nu} = 1.41\pm0.15$, in a COS composite spectrum of 159 UV-bright AGN. These two AGN are outliers in the index distribution, perhaps resulting from their extremely high UV luminosity ($10^{48}~{\rm erg~s}^{-1}$), estimated black-hole masses (0.5-1)$\times10^{10} M_{\odot}$, and effects on the inner accretion disk and Comptonized winds.

**Comment:** This paper studies the spectral energy distributions of ultra-luminous quasars using HST/COS. It focuses on AGN properties and accretion disks, which are not related to the core topics such as dwarf galaxies, star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

## 56. [Foreground and internal free-free absorption in particle-accelerating colliding-wind binaries : Insights from the radio emission of WR 147](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10506) <a id="link56"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10506

**Abstract:** Radio emission from massive binary systems is generally of composite nature, showing both a thermal emission component from the winds and a non-thermal component from relativistic electrons accelerated in the colliding-wind region. Understanding the processes ruling their radio spectrum is essential to investigate the role of these objects in the production of non-thermal particle populations in our galaxy. Our objective is to explore how the processes at work in particle-accelerating colliding-wind binaries (PACWBs) alter their spectral energy distribution, following a simple phenomenological description. We focus mainly on the role of free-free absorption (FFA) at low frequencies. Our intention is to use WR 147 as a test case, before tentatively extrapolating to a more generic behaviour. We processed recent Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array data, optimised for spectral analysis, combined with older measurements published in the literature at other frequencies. We analysed the radio spectrum considering both a more classical foreground free-free absorption (f-FFA) model and, for the first time, an internal free--free absorption (i-FFA) model. Our results show that the f-FFA model does not reproduce the spectral energy distribution of WR 147 at low frequencies. The i-FFA model is more efficient in providing a more complete description of the SED down to 610 MHz. This model is the only one to account for a change in the spectral index at low frequencies without any exponential drop in flux, as predicted by the f-FFA model. In addition, the upper limit at 150 MHz shows that two turnovers occur in the radio spectrum of WR 147, suggesting the effect of both i-FFA and f-FFA is seen in two regions of the spectrum.

**Comment:** This paper analyzes radio emission and free-free absorption in a colliding-wind binary (WR 147). It is focused on massive stars and particle acceleration, not on any of the core topics such as dwarf galaxies, star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

## 57. [Automatic detection of Ellerman bombs in the H$\alpha$ line](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10853) <a id="link57"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.10853

**Authors:** A. Faryad, A. G. M. Pietrow, M. Verma, C. Denker

**Abstract:** Ellerman bombs (EBs) are small and short-lived magnetic reconnection events in the lower solar atmosphere, most commonly reported in the line wings of the H$\alpha$ line. These events are thought to play a role in heating the solar chromosphere and corona, but their size, short lifetime, and similarity to other brightenings make them difficult to detect. We aim to automatically detect and statistically analyze EBs at different heliocentric angles to find trends in their physical properties. We developed an automated EB detection pipeline based on a star-finding algorithm. This pipeline was used on ten high-resolution H$\alpha$ datasets from the 1-meter Swedish Solar Telescope (SST). This pipeline identifies and tracks EBs in time, while separating them from visually similar pseudo-EBs. It returns key parameters such as size, contrast, lifetime, and occurrence rates based on a dynamic threshold and the more classical static `contrast threshold` of 1.5 times the mean quiet-Sun (QS) intensity. For our dynamic threshold, we found a total of 2257 EBs from 28,772 individual detections across our datasets. On average, the full detection set exhibits an area of 0.44 arcsec$^2$ (0.37 Mm$^2$), a peak intensity contrast of 1.4 relative to the QS, and a median lifetime of 2.3 min. ...

**Comment:** This paper focuses on the automatic detection of Ellerman bombs in the solar atmosphere using H-alpha data. It is unrelated to any of the specified criteria, as it deals with solar physics and not galaxies, star formation histories, or dark matter.

**Relevance:** 1

> [PAPER LIST HERE]
> 
> ## Relevant Topics
> 
> Use the following relevance criteria when considering which papers to keep. To be rated as highly relevant, a paper must fit at least one of the relevant topics below. Papers which fit multiple categories should be rated more highly.
> 
> 1. Near-Field Cosmology
>    - Relevant: Astrophysics work focusing on dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, extragalactic satellite luminosity functions, measurements of dark matter density profiles (core-cusp), abundances of dwarf galaxies, signs of historic interactions between the Milky Way and other galaxies (e.g., the accreted stellar halo). Both theoretical and observational work is relevant.
>    - Irrelevant: Papers that focus on Milky Way properties like the stellar disk, bar, and Galactic center. Papers that focus on higher mass galaxies, like massive spirals and elliptical galaxies.
> 
> 2. Resolved Star Formation Histories
>    - Relevant: Observational work deriving star formation histories from observed color-magnitude diagrams of galaxies. Theoretical work measuring star formation histories of simulated galaxies is also relevant, but should be weighted lower.
> 
> 3. Star Formation Quenching
>    - Relevant: Observational work discussing the quenching of star formation in galaxies, **particularly dwarf galaxies**. Work on higher mass galaxies may still be relevant, but should be weighted lower. Theoretical work on the quenching of star formation of dwarf galaxies is also relevant.
> 
> 4. Stellar Models
>    - Relevant: Theoretical work presenting new stellar models, either stellar evolutionary tracks (i.e., stellar interior models) or stellar atmosphere models. Work presenting new tables of bolometric corrections is also relevant.
> 
> 5. Numerical Galaxy Simulations
>    - Relevant: Theoretical work presenting new numerical simulations of galaxies is relevant, especially high-resolution simulations. Simulations that include new physics models (e.g., ionizing radiation, cosmic ray transport) should be given increased weight. Work analyzing previously published simulations should be weighted lower, unless the work also pertains to one of the other relevant topics. Semi-analytic work on galaxies that matches the other criteria is also relevant.
>    - Irrelevant: Numerical simulations that do not focus on galaxies and do not fulfill other criteria are not relevant. Examples include simulations of tidal disruption events, black hole accretion disks, and planet formation.
> 
> 6. Star Formation Driven Outflows
>    - Relevant: Observational and theoretical work examining the role the star formation processes play on driving galaxy-scale gas outflows. Measurements of mass-loading factors are particularly relevant. Work commenting on the phase structure of the outflows is also relevant. Work on galaxies more massive than the LMC should be weighted lower.
>    - Irrelevant: Papers that focus on outflows driven by sources other than stellar feedback, such as AGN-driven feedback. Papers are relevant if they include discussion of both star-formation-driven outflows and other types of outflows.
> 
> 7. Circumgalactic Medium
>    - Relevant: Observational and theoretical work examining the circumgalactic media (CGM) of dwarf galaxies is relevant. Increased weight should be given to work that connects the CGM to ISM outflows from the galaxy.
>

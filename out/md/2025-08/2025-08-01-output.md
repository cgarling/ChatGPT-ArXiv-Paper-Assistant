## 1. [High-redshift Galaxies from JWST Observations in More Realistic Dark Matter Halo Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23742) <a id="link1"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23742

**Authors:** Saeed Fakhry, Reyhaneh Vojoudi Salmani, Javad T. Firouzjaee

**Abstract:** The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled unexpectedly massive galaxy candidates at high redshifts, challenging standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological predictions. In this work, we study the predictions of more realistic dark matter halo models combined with modified matter power spectra for interpreting JWST observations of high-redshift galaxies. We employ three halo mass functions: the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) model and two physically motivated alternatives introduced by Del Popolo (DP1 and DP2). Our analysis of cumulative stellar mass densities at $z \simeq 8$--$10$ reveals that the standard ST mass function systematically underpredicts JWST observations, achieving marginal consistency only with high star formation efficiencies. In contrast, the DP1 and DP2 models demonstrate significantly improved agreement with observations even within standard $\Lambda$CDM, with statistical consistency within $1$--$2\sigma$ for moderate star formation efficiencies. When combined with modified power spectra, these refined halo models achieve suitable agreement with JWST data across broad parameter ranges, particularly for steeper spectral indices that amplify high-mass halo formation. Crucially, we find that moderate star formation efficiencies coupled with small-scale power enhancements provide robust reconciliation between theory and observations, eliminating the need for extreme astrophysical assumptions. Our results demonstrate that incorporating realistic halo collapse physics, often neglected in standard analyses, can substantially alleviate apparent tensions between JWST observations and $\Lambda$CDM predictions, highlighting the critical importance of small-scale structure formation physics in early cosmic epochs.

**Comment:** This paper directly addresses the abundance of high-redshift galaxies and the dark matter halo mass function, using new models to reconcile JWST observations with ΛCDM. The focus on the abundance of galaxies and the implications for small-scale structure formation is highly relevant to near-field cosmology and the satellite luminosity function criterion.

## 2. [Exploring Mixing Thresholds in Asteroseismic Stellar Evolution Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23275) <a id="link2"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23275

**Authors:** Lynn Buchele

**Abstract:** Inferences from observations clearly show that mixing in stars extends beyond the convective boundaries defined by mixing length theory. This triggered the proposal of a variety of prescriptions to include additional mixing in stellar models. These prescriptions typically introduce free parameters to set the extent of the additional mixing and may also introduce numerical parameters. In the case of exponential overshooting, one must decide the threshold at which the exponential decay of the mixing coefficient can be treated as zero. Using the MESA stellar evolution code, I explore the effect of varying this parameter on asteroseismic models of main-sequence stars with growing convective cores. From this, I conclude that overshoot_D_min should be set to $10^{-2}$ cm$^2$/s or lower for these stars. The default value in MESA is four orders of magnitude higher than this recommendation, which results in discontinuous evolution.

**Comment:** This paper explores mixing thresholds in stellar evolution models using MESA, directly addressing the 'Stellar Models' criterion by investigating the impact of mixing prescriptions on stellar evolution. This is a close match to the core topics.

## 3. [Automated calibration of simulated galaxy catalogues for cosmological analyses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23451) <a id="link3"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23451

**Authors:** I. Tutusaus, P. Fosalba, L. Blot, P. Tallada-Cresp\'i, J. Carretero, F. J. Castander, E. J. Gonzalez, A. Alarcon

**Abstract:** Simulated galaxy catalogues have become an essential tool for preparing and exploiting observations from galaxy surveys. They constitute a key ingredient in modelling the systematic uncertainties present in the analysis. However, in order to reach the large volume and high precision required for galaxy surveys, we generally populate dark matter haloes with galaxies following certain theoretical recipes. Such recipes contain free parameters that are calibrated comparing the simulations against observations, but the creation of galaxy mocks is a stochastic process with a large number of free parameters to calibrate. We present a new pipeline, based on the differential evolution algorithm, that can calibrate galaxy mocks in a fully automated way for realistic scenarios with a large parameter space. We apply the pipeline to galaxy mocks built on a combination of halo occupation distribution and sub-halo abundance matching techniques. We show that our pipeline can properly calibrate the galaxy mocks against observations for both $\Lambda$CDM and modified gravity halo catalogues. This type of calibration pipeline provides a new tool for automating the calibration of future massive galaxy mocks.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new automated pipeline for calibrating simulated galaxy catalogs, using HOD and sub-halo abundance matching. It is directly relevant to the 'Numerical Galaxy Simulations' criterion, as it improves the realism and calibration of galaxy simulations, which are essential for near-field cosmology and related studies.

## 4. [Capturing star formation activity from compressed photometric images of galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23019) <a id="link4"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23019

**Authors:** Kyuseok Oh, M. Dennis Turp

**Abstract:** We present a novel approach for classifying star-forming galaxies using photometric images. By utilizing approximately $124,000$ optical color composite images and spectroscopic data of nearby galaxies at $0.01<0.06$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, along with follow-up spectroscopic line measurements from the OSSY catalog, and leveraging the Vision Transformer machine-learning technique, we demonstrate that galaxy images in JPEG format alone can be directly used to determine whether star-forming activity dominates the galaxy, bypassing traditional spectroscopic analyses such as emission-line diagnostic diagrams. We anticipate that this method holds significant potential for application in current and future large-scale surveys, such as Euclid, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

**Comment:** The paper presents a machine learning method to classify star-forming galaxies from photometric images. While it deals with star formation activity, it does not focus on resolved star formation histories, quenching, or specifically on dwarf galaxies. The method is general and not tailored to the core topics.

**Abstract:** We present a systematic study of merging galaxies among Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) using JWST/NIRCam high-resolution imaging data. From a large sample of 817 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at $38.5$) and bright ($M_{\rm UV}<-19.5$) systems. At fixed $M_*$ and $M_{\rm UV}$, we find negligible differences in the UV slope ($\beta$) between late-stage mergers and isolated LAEs; however, a clear bimodal distribution emerges in the $M_*$-sSFR plane, where isolated LAEs peak at $\log(M_*/M_\odot)\approx7.8$ and $\log({\rm sSFR/yr^{-1}})\approx-7.4$, and late-stage mergers peak at $\log(M_*/M_\odot)\approx8.6$ and $\log({\rm sSFR/yr^{-1}})\approx-7.6$. Our results reveal two evolutionary classes -- Pristine LAEs, low-mass ($M_*10^{8.5}M_\odot$) systems in which mergers enhance star formation and facilitate the escape of Lyman-alpha photons or accrete pristine LAEs -- both of which are consistent with both observational and theoretical expectations and collectively demonstrate that mergers are a central driver of LAE evolution across the first two billion years.

**Comment:** This paper studies Lyman-alpha emitters at high redshift (z=3-7) using JWST, focusing on the role of mergers in their evolution. While it discusses star formation and galaxy evolution, the focus is on high-redshift galaxies, not on near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or dwarf galaxy quenching. The relevance is borderline as it may inform general galaxy evolution, but not the core topics.

**Abstract:** Understanding the Milky Way disc formation requires characterising its structural and kinematic properties as functions of stellar age. Using red giant stars from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia DR3, we model the age-dependent stellar kinematics with a quasi-isothermal distribution function and fit disc parameters as a function of age using non-parametric splines. We identify a transition from thick to thin disc populations around 10 Gyr ago. Stars older than this have short scale lengths ($\sim$1.7 kpc), typical of the thick disc, while younger stars exhibit increasing scale length with decreasing age, consistent with inside-out formation of the thin disc. This transition coincides with the end of the starburst triggered by the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger. Stars formed around 10 Gyr ago exhibit a dip in scale length, even shorter than that of the thick disc. Comparison with an Auriga simulation suggests that this scale-length dip reflects gas disc shrinking caused by the transition from a cold to hot gas accretion mode. We propose the following disc formation scenario: (1) the thick disc formed under cold-mode accretion; (2) the GSE merger triggered a starburst and increased the total mass of the Galaxy, causing the transition to hot-mode accretion; (3) rapid gas consumption led to temporary shrinking of the star-forming gas disc; and then (4) thin disc grows in an inside-out fashion, as the size of the star-forming gas disc grows via hot-mode smooth gas accretion.

**Comment:** This paper analyzes the impact of the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger on the Milky Way's thick-to-thin disc transition and gas disc evolution. While it discusses a major merger event and its effect on the Milky Way's structure, it focuses on the stellar disc and not on dwarf galaxies, satellite systems, or resolved star formation histories of satellites. The topic is adjacent to near-field cosmology but does not directly address the core criteria.

## 7. [The Emergence and Ionizing Feedback of Pop III.1 Stars as Progenitors for Supermassive Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23004) <a id="link7"></a>

**Abstract:** Recent observations by JWST reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of rapidly growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe, underscoring the need for improved models for their origin and growth. Employing new full radiative transfer hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, we investigate the local and intergalactic feedback of SMBH progenitors for the Population III.1 scenario, i.e., efficient formation of supermassive stars from pristine, undisturbed dark matter minihalos. Our cosmological simulations capture the R-type expansion phase of these Pop III.1 stars, with their H-ionizing photon luminosities of $\sim10^{53}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ generating HII regions that extend deep into the intergalactic medium, reaching comoving radii of $r_{\rm HII}\sim 1\,{\rm cMpc}$. We vary both the Pop III.1 ionization flux and cosmological formation environments, finding the former regulates their final $r_{\rm HII}$, whereas the latter is more important in setting their formation redshift. We use the results from our radiation-hydrodynamics simulations to estimate the cosmic number density of SMBHs, $n_{\rm SMBH}$, expected from Pop III.1 progenitors. We find $n_{\rm SMBH}\sim10^{-1}\,{\rm cMpc}^{-3}$, consistent with the results inferred from recent observations of the local and high redshift universe. Overall, this establishes Pop III.1 progenitors as viable candidates for the formation of the first SMBHs, and emphasises the importance of exploring heavy mass seed scenarios.

**Comment:** This paper uses radiative transfer hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation and feedback of Population III.1 stars as progenitors of supermassive black holes in the early universe. While it involves galaxy simulations and feedback, the focus is on the formation of SMBHs and Pop III stars in pristine minihalos, not on dwarf satellites, resolved star formation histories, or near-field cosmology.

## 8. [Modeling turbulent and self-gravitating fluids with Fourier neural operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23662) <a id="link8"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23662

**Authors:** Keith Poletti, Stella S. R. Offner, Rachel A. Ward

**Abstract:** Neural Operators (NOs) are a leading method for surrogate modeling of partial differential equations. Unlike traditional neural networks, which approximate individual functions, NOs learn the mappings between function spaces. While NOs have been predominantly tested on simplified 1D and 2D problems, such as those explored in prior works, these studies fail to address the complexities of more realistic, high-dimensional, and high-dynamic range systems. Moreover, many real-world applications involve incomplete or noisy data, which has not been adequately explored in current NO literature. In this work, we present a novel application of NOs to astrophysical data, which involves high-dynamic range projections into an observational space. We train Fourier NO (FNO) models to predict the evolution of incomplete observational proxies with density variations spanning four orders of magnitude. We demonstrate that FNOs can predict the effects of unobserved dynamical variables. Our work lays the groundwork for future studies that forecast direct astronomical observables.

**Comment:** This paper presents the application of Fourier Neural Operators to model turbulent and self-gravitating fluids, with a focus on astrophysical data and high-dynamic range projections. While it involves numerical methods and simulations relevant to astrophysics, it does not specifically focus on galaxy simulations or any of the other core topics.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23302

**Authors:** Yusuke Mikura, Teppei Okumura, Misao Sasaki

**Abstract:** Gravitational waves (GWs) distort galaxy shapes through the tidal effect, offering a novel avenue to probe the nature of gravity. In this paper, we investigate how extra GW polarizations beyond those predicted by general relativity imprint observable signatures on galaxy shapes. Since galaxy shapes are measured as two-dimensional images projected onto the celestial sphere, we present three-dimensional statistical quantities of the projected tidal tensor sourced by the tensor perturbation. We show that the presence of extra polarization modes modifies both the amplitude and angular dependence of the correlation functions. Furthermore, we identify a distinct observational channel for probing parity violation in helicity-two and helicity-one modes. In particular, we show that if they propagate at different speeds, galaxy surveys can disentangle the source of parity violation. Our findings establish a theoretical framework for using upcoming large-scale galaxy surveys to test modified gravity theories through the polarization content of GWs.

**Comment:** This paper investigates the imprint of gravitational wave polarizations on galaxy shapes and their use in testing modified gravity. While it involves galaxy surveys, the focus is on gravitational wave effects and not on any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

**Abstract:** The relation between the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies encodes information on their mode of growth, especially at the earliest epochs. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened such investigations by detecting the host galaxies of AGN and more luminous quasars within the first billion years of the universe (z > 6). Here, we evaluate the relation between the mass of SMBHs and the total stellar mass of their host galaxies using a sample of nine quasars at 6.18 < z < 6.4 from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) survey with NIRCam and NIRSpec observations. We find that the observed location of these quasars in the SMBH-galaxy mass plane (log MBH ~ 8-9; log M* ~9.5-11) is consistent with a non-evolving intrinsic mass relation with dispersion (0.80_{-0.28}^{+0.23} dex) higher than the local value (~0.3-0.4 dex). Our analysis is based on a forward model of systematics and includes a consideration of the impact of selection effects and measurement uncertainties, an assumption on the slope of the mass relation, and finds a reasonable AGN fraction (2.3%) of galaxies at z ~ 6 with an actively growing UV-unobscured black hole. In particular, models with a substantially higher normalisation in MBH would require an unrealistically low intrinsic dispersion (~0.22 dex) and a lower AGN fraction (~0.6%). Consequently, our results predict a large population of AGNs at lower black hole masses, as are now just starting to be discovered in focused efforts with JWST.

**Comment:** This paper uses JWST to study the mass relation between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies at z > 6. The focus is on high-redshift, massive galaxies and their SMBHs, not on dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, or the other core topics. The connection to the core topics is weak.

## 11. [Discovery of a Pair of Galaxies with Both Hosting X-ray Binary Candidates at $z=2.544$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23230) <a id="link11"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23230

**Authors:** Sijia Cai, Zheng Cai, Jianwei Lyu, Yunjing Wu, Xiaojing Lin, Mingyu Li, Junjie Mao, Jiayi Chen, Pengjun Lu

**Abstract:** Among high-redshift galaxies, aside from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), X-ray binaries (XRBs) can be significant sources of X-ray emission. XRBs play a crucial role in galaxy evolution, reflecting the stellar populations of galaxies and regulating star formation through feedback, thereby shaping galaxy structure. In this study, we report a spectroscopically confirmed X-ray emitting galaxy pair (UDF3 and UDF3-2) at $z = 2.544$. By combining multi-wavelength observations from JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectra, JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging, Chandra, HST, VLT, ALMA, and VLA, we analyze the ionized emission lines, which are primarily driven by H II region-like processes. Additionally, we find that the mid-infrared radiation can be fully attributed to dust emission from galaxy themselves. Our results indicate that the X-ray emission from these two galaxies is dominated by high-mass XRBs, with luminosities of $L_X= (1.43\pm0.40) \times 10^{42} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ for UDF3, and $(0.40\pm0.12) \times 10^{42} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ for UDF3-2. Furthermore, we measure the star formation rate (SFR) of $529_{-88}^{+64}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for UDF3, placing it $\approx$ 0.5 dex below the $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation. This offset reflects the redshift-dependent enhancement of $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation, which is influenced by metallicity and serves as a key observable for XRB evolution. In contrast, UDF3-2, with the SFR of $34_{-6}^{+6}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, aligns well with the $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation. This galaxy pair represents the highest-redshift non-AGN-dominated galaxies with individual X-ray detections reported to date. This finding suggests that the contribution of XRBs to galaxy X-ray emission at high redshift may be underestimated.

**Comment:** This paper studies high-redshift galaxies with X-ray binary candidates and their X-ray emission, focusing on the $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation and the role of XRBs in galaxy evolution. However, the galaxies are at z=2.5 and are not dwarfs or satellites, and the focus is not on near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or outflows in dwarfs. The work is more about high-mass, high-SFR galaxies and XRB feedback at high redshift, which is outside the core topics.

## 12. [How to embed any likelihood into SBI: Application to Planck + Stage IV galaxy surveys and Dynamical Dark Energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22990) <a id="link12"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.22990

**Authors:** Guillermo Franco Abell\'an, Noemi Anau Montel, Oleg Savchenko, Christoph Weniger

**Abstract:** Simulation-based inference (SBI) allows fast Bayesian inference for simulators encoding implicit likelihoods. However, some explicit likelihoods cannot be easily reformulated as simulators, hindering their integration into combined analyses within SBI frameworks. One key example in cosmology is given by the Planck CMB likelihoods. We present a simple method to construct an effective simulator for any explicit likelihood using samples from a previously converged Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) run. This effective simulator can subsequently be combined with any forward simulator. To illustrate this method, we combine the full Planck CMB likelihoods with a 3x2pt simulator (cosmic shear, galaxy clustering and their cross-correlation) for a Stage IV survey like Euclid, and test evolving dark energy parameterized by the $w_0w_a$ equation-of-state. Assuming the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology hinted by DESI BAO DR2 + Planck 2018 + PantheonPlus SNIa datasets, we find that future 3x2pt data alone could detect evolving dark energy at $5\sigma$, while its combination with current CMB, BAO and SNIa datasets could raise the detection to almost $7\sigma$. Moreover, thanks to simulation reuse enabled by SBI, we show that our joint analysis is in excellent agreement with MCMC while requiring zero Boltzmann solver calls. This result opens up the possibility of performing massive global scans combining explicit and implicit likelihoods in a highly efficient way.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new method for embedding explicit likelihoods into simulation-based inference, with an application to cosmological parameter estimation (Planck, galaxy surveys, dark energy). While relevant to cosmology, it does not address near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, or any of the other core topics.

## 13. [Consistent $N_{\rm eff}$ fitting in big bang nucleosynthesis analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23354) <a id="link13"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23354

**Authors:** Sougata Ganguly, Tae Hyun Jung, Seokhoon Yun

**Abstract:** The effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\rm eff}$, serves as a key fitting parameter extensively employed in cosmological studies. In this work, we point out a fundamental inconsistency in the conventional treatment of $N_{\rm eff}$ in big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), particularly regarding its applicability to new physics scenarios where $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, the deviation of $N_{\rm eff}$ from the standard BBN prediction, is negative. To ensure consistent interpretation, it is imperative to either restrict the allowed range of $N_{\rm eff}$ or systematically adjust neutrino-induced reaction rates based on physically motivated assumptions. As a concrete example, we consider a simple scenario in which a negative $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ arises from entropy injection into the electromagnetic sector due to the decay of long-lived particles after neutrino decoupling. This process dilutes the neutrino density and suppresses the rate of neutrino-driven neutron-proton conversion. Under this assumption, we demonstrate that the resulting BBN constraints on $N_{\rm eff}$ deviate significantly from those obtained by the conventional, but unphysical, extrapolation of dark radiation scenarios into the $\Delta N_{\rm eff} < 0$ regime.

**Comment:** This paper discusses the effective number of neutrino species (N_eff) in the context of big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and its implications for cosmological constraints. While BBN is a cosmological topic, the focus is on early universe physics and not on near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or any of the other core topics. The connection to the core topics is very weak.

## 14. [AGN Feedback Efficiency of NAL Quasars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23328) <a id="link14"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23328

**Authors:** Toru Misawa, Jane C. Charlton, Michael Eracleous

**Abstract:** We consider if outflowing winds that are detected via narrow absorption lines (NALs) with FWHM of $<$ 500 km/s (i.e., NAL outflows) in quasar spectra contribute to feedback. As our sample, we choose 11 NAL systems in eight optically luminous quasars from the NAL survey of Misawa et al. (2007a), based on the following selection criteria: i) they exhibit ``partial coverage'' suggesting quasar origin (i.e., intrinsic NALs), ii) they have at least one low-ionization absorption line (C II and/or Si II), and iii) the Ly$\alpha$ absorption line is covered by available spectra. The results depend critically on this selection method, which has caveats and uncertainties associated with it, as we discuss in a dedicated section of the paper. Using the column density ratio of the excited and ground states of C II and Si II, we place upper limits on the electron density as $n_{\rm e}$ $ 79$ - (3.1$\times 10^{5})$ and $\log(\dot{E_{\rm k}}/{\rm erg~s}^{-1}) > 42.9$ - 49.8, respectively. Taking the NAL selection and these results at face value, the inferred feedback efficiency can be comparable to or even larger than those of broad absorption line and other outflow classes, and large enough to generate significant AGN feedback. However, the question of the connection of quasar-driven outflows to NAL absorbers at large distances from the central engine remains open and should be addressed by future theoretical work.

**Comment:** This paper studies AGN-driven outflows detected via narrow absorption lines (NALs) in quasars, focusing on their feedback efficiency. While it discusses outflows, the outflows are AGN-driven, not star-formation-driven, and the galaxies are luminous quasars, not dwarfs. The connection to the core topics is weak, as AGN-driven feedback is not a relevant criterion.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23100

**Authors:** A. Siemiginowska, R. Morganti, G. Fabbiano, E. O'Sullivan, T. Oosterloo, C. Tadhunter, D. Burke

**Abstract:** We present a deep high-resolution Chandra X-ray Observatory image data of a powerful compact radio source PKS 0023-26 associated with a quasar at redshift 0.322. The earlier studies of the optical environment suggested that the source could be located in a galaxy cluster or a group. However, we report a non-detection of hot gas on large scales (out to $\sim 60$ kpc radius) and place an upper limit on the X-ray luminosity of $<3\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, consistent only with the presence of a poor, low-temperature ($\rm kT < 0.5$ keV) galaxy group. X-ray spectral analysis of the central circular region, $r<7$ kpc shows, in addition to the mildly absorbed AGN, a thermal emission component with a temperature of $\rm kT=0.9^{+0.19}_{-0.37}$ keV. We discuss the origin of this hot component as a result of interaction between the evolving radio source and the interstellar medium. Our high angular resolution X-ray image traces the distribution of hot gas which is closely aligned with and extends beyond the radio source, and also in the direction perpendicular to the radio source axis. The X-rays are enhanced at the northern radio lobe and the location of the peak of the CO(3-2)/CO(2-1) line emission, suggesting that the interactions between the jet and cold medium result in the X-ray radiation which excites CO. The shock driven by the jet into the ISM is supersonic with the Mach number of $\mathcal{M} \sim 1.75-2$, creating the cocoon of hot X-rays surrounding the radio source. This result agrees with observations of shocks in other radio galaxies pointing to a prevalent impact of jets on ISM.

**Comment:** This paper studies the interaction between radio jets and the ISM in a quasar host galaxy, focusing on X-ray and CO emission. While it discusses outflows and ISM interactions, the galaxy is a massive quasar host at z=0.322, not a dwarf or near-field system. The focus is on AGN-driven feedback, not star-formation-driven outflows or the CGM of dwarfs.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23040

**Authors:** Alejandra Granados (for the IceCube Collaboration), Rishi Babu (for the IceCube Collaboration), Mehr Un Nisa (for the IceCube Collaboration)

**Abstract:** The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the South Pole, covers a cubic kilometer of Antarctic ice, and is designed to detect astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range. While IceCube has recently identified a diffuse flux of neutrinos originating from the Galactic Plane, specific sources of astrophysical neutrinos within the Milky Way remain elusive. Hadronic gamma-rays, produced through the decay of neutral pions, are expected to display a characteristic "pion bump" or "spectral break" around 200 MeV. Recent studies by the Fermi-LAT Collaboration highlight 56 sources from the 4FGL Catalog exhibiting a spectral break in the MeV energy range. Detecting astrophysical neutrinos from these sources would provide compelling evidence for cosmic-ray acceleration in their vicinity. In this analysis, we search for astrophysical neutrino emission from 56 sources showing characteristics of a pion bump using 13 years of IceCube data. Our findings could enhance our understanding of potential cosmic-ray acceleration sites in the galaxy.

**Comment:** The paper discusses neutrino searches from Galactic sources using IceCube, focusing on cosmic-ray acceleration sites in the Milky Way. While it is related to Galactic astrophysics, it does not address near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, or any other core topics.

**Abstract:** The young neutron star X-ray binary, Cir X-1, resides within its natal supernova remnant and experiences ongoing outbursts every 16.5 days, likely due to periastron passage in an eccentric orbit. We present the deepest ever radio image of the field, which reveals relativistic jet-punched bubbles that are aligned with the mean axis of the smaller-scale jets observed close to the X-ray binary core. We are able to measure the minimum energy for the bubble, which is around $E_{min}$ = $10^{45} $ erg. The nature and morphological structure of the source were investigated through spectral index mapping and numerical simulations. The spectral index map reveals a large fraction of the nebula's radio continuum has a steep slope, associated with optically thin synchrotron emission, although there are distinct regions with flatter spectra. Our data are not sensitive enough to measure the spectral index of the protruding bubbles. We used the PLUTO code to run relativistic hydrodynamic simulations to try and qualitatively reproduce the observations with a combined supernova-plus-jet system. We are able to do so using a simplified model in which the asymmetrical bubbles are best represented by supernova explosion which is closely followed (within 100 years) by a phase of very powerful jets lasting less than 1000 years. These are the first observations revealing the initial breakout of neutron star jets from their natal supernova remnant, and further support the scenario in which Cir X-1 is a younger relation of the archetypal jet source SS433.

**Comment:** The paper presents observations and simulations of relativistic jets from a neutron star X-ray binary breaking out of its natal supernova remnant. The focus is on jet-supernova interactions and not on galaxies, dwarf galaxies, or their star formation histories. No direct relevance to near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

## 18. [Accretion Regimes of Neutrino-Cooled Flows onto Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23691) <a id="link18"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23691

**Authors:** Javiera Hern\'andez-Morales, Daniel M. Siegel

**Abstract:** Neutrino-cooled accretion disks can form in the aftermath of neutron-star mergers as well as during the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars (collapsars) and the accretion-induced collapse of rapidly rotating white dwarfs. Due to Pauli blocking as electrons become degenerate at sufficiently high accretion rates $\dot{M}$, the resulting 'self-neutronization' of the dissociated accreting plasma makes these astrophysical systems promising sources of rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis (the r-process). We present a one-dimensional general-relativistic, viscous-hydrodynamic model of neutrino-cooled accretion disks around black holes. With collapsars, super-collapsars and very massive star collapse in mind, we chart the composition of the accretion flow and systematically explore different radiatively efficient and inefficient accretion regimes with increasing $\dot M$, across a vast parameter space of $\dot{M}\sim 10^{-6}-10^6 M_\odot \,\text{s}^{-1}$, black hole masses of $M_\bullet\sim 1 - 10^4 M_\odot$ and dimensionless spins of $\chi_\bullet \in [0,1)$, as well as $\alpha$-viscosity values of $\alpha\sim 10^{-3}-1$. We show that these accretion regimes are separated by characteristic thresholds $\dot{M}_{\rm char}$ that follow power laws $\dot M_{\rm char}\propto M_{\bullet}^\alpha \alpha^\beta$ and that can be understood based on analytic approximations we derive. We find that outflows from such disks are promising sites of r-process nucleosynthesis up to $M_\bullet \lesssim 3000 M_\odot$. These give rise to lanthanide-bearing 'red' super-kilonovae transients mostly for $M_\bullet \lesssim 200-500 M_\odot$ and lanthanide suppressed 'blue' super-kilonovae for larger $M_\bullet$. Proton-rich outflows can develop specifically for large black hole masses ($M_\bullet \gtrsim 100 M_\odot$) in certain accretion regimes, which may give rise to proton-rich isotopes via the $\nu$p-process.

**Comment:** This paper presents a model of neutrino-cooled accretion disks around black holes, with implications for r-process nucleosynthesis and kilonovae. The focus is on accretion physics and nucleosynthesis in extreme environments, not on galaxies, dwarf galaxies, or the other core topics. No direct relevance to near-field cosmology or the other criteria.

## 19. [Kilo-scale point-source inference using Parametric Cataloging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23472) <a id="link19"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23472

**Authors:** Gabriel H. Collin

**Abstract:** The estimation of the number of point-sources in the sky is one the oldest problems in astronomy, yet an easy and efficient method for estimating the uncertainty on these counts is still an open problem. Probabilistic cataloging solves the general point-source inference problem, but the trans-dimensional nature of the inference method requires a bespoke approach that is difficult to scale. Here it is shown that probabilistic cataloging can be performed in a fixed-dimensional framework called Parametric Cataloging under mild assumptions on some of the priors. The method requires only a simple reparameterization of the flux coordinates, yielding an accessible method that can be implemented in most probabilistic programming environments. As the parameter space is fixed-dimensional, off the shelf gradient based samplers can be employed which allows the method to scale to tens of thousands of sources.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new method for probabilistic cataloging of point sources, which is a general methodological advance in astronomical data analysis. While point-source inference is important, it does not directly address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

**Abstract:** The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is usually inferred from the depth of the shower maximum ($X_{\rm{max}}$) of cosmic-ray showers, which is only ambiguously determined by modern hadronic interaction models. We present a data-driven interpretation of UHECRs, the heavy-metal scenario, which assumes pure iron nuclei above $10^{19.6}$ eV ($\approx 40$ EeV) as the heaviest observed mass composition and introduces a global shift in the $X_{\rm{max}}$ scale predicted by the two hadronic interaction models QGSJet II-04 and Sibyll 2.3d. We investigate the consequences of the proposed mass-composition model based on the obtained shifts in the $X_{\rm{max}}$ values, which naturally lead to a heavier mass composition of UHECRs than conventionally assumed. We explore the consequences of our model on the energy evolution of relative fractions of primary species, consequently decomposed energy spectrum, hadronic-interaction studies and the arrival directions of UHECRs. We show that within this scenario, presented recently in Vicha et al 2025 ApJL 986 L34, the cosmic-ray measurements can be interpreted in a more consistent way.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new scenario for the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, focusing on heavy nuclei. While it involves cosmic rays and their sources, it does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, or galaxy simulations.

## 21. [Classifying Compact Radio Emission in Nearby Galaxies: a 10GHz Study of Active Galactic Nuclei, Supernovae, Anomalous Microwave Emission and Star Forming Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23332) <a id="link21"></a>

Harff, Amna Khalyleh, Timothy McBride, Jesse Mason, Anthony Preston, Cortney Rinehart, Ethan Vinson, Teresa Panurach, Richard M. Plotkin, Liliana Rivera Sandoval

**Abstract:** We present 115 compact radio point sources in three galaxies, NGC 5474, NGC 4631 and M51, taken in the most extended (A-)configuration of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 10GHz. Several of these compact radio point sources have diffuse counterparts identified in previous multi-band studies of resolved radio continuum emission. We find compact counterparts to eight star forming regions, four anomalous microwave emission candidates, and one supernova remnant (SN 2011dh). Nine of the compact radio sources match X-ray counterparts, the majority of which are background galaxies. These AGN are all within the D25 (isophotal diameter) of the host galaxy and might act as contaminants for X-ray binary population studies, highlighting the need for high-resolution multi-band imaging. This study showcases the broad number of science cases that require sensitive radio facilities, like the upcoming Square Kilometre Array and the planned next generation Very Large Array.

**Comment:** This paper presents a study of compact radio emission in three nearby galaxies, identifying sources such as AGN, supernovae, and star forming regions. While it includes star forming regions, there is no mention of resolved star formation histories, dwarf galaxies, or galaxy simulations. The focus is on source classification, not on the core topics.

## 22. [How Massive Star Clusters Form and Evolve: A Near-IR Survey of the W51 Complex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23112) <a id="link22"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23112

**Authors:** Aden Dawson, Adam Ginsburg, Carlos Roman-Zuniga

**Abstract:** We present near-infrared JHKs and narrow-band H2(1-0) photometric observations of the W51A region, obtained with GTC EMIR, aiming to characterize its young stellar population and provide mass estimates for individual cluster members and the proto-clusters. Our observations reveal over 3000 new sources, out of which 88 are located in the proto-clusters, W51 IRS2 and W51 Main. The average extinction (AV), measured from the J-H color, of sources is 19 AV in W51 IRS2 and 14 AV in W51 Main. We document 17 new instances of H2 emission in the region by utilizing observations from the H2(1-0) narrow-band filter. Despite limited completeness, we estimated masses for each cluster member and estimated the total cluster mass to be in the range of 900-4700 solar masses for W51 IRS2 and 500-2700 solar masses for W51 Main, using an assumed age range of 1-3 Myr. We measured the initial mass function (IMF) in the proto-clusters assuming a range of ages from 1-3 Myr and found that the IMF slopes for both proto-clusters are consistent with the Salpeter IMF in the mass range greater than or equal to 8 solar masses within 1 to 2 sigma.

**Comment:** The paper presents a near-IR survey of the W51 complex, focusing on the formation and evolution of massive star clusters. While it discusses the initial mass function and cluster properties, it does not address resolved star formation histories of galaxies, dwarf galaxies, or quenching. The focus is on a massive star-forming region, not on galaxy-scale processes.

## 23. [Decrease in Milky Way rotation curve revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23551) <a id="link23"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23551

**Authors:** Jozef Kla\v{c}ka, Michal \v{S}turc

**Abstract:** Context. Latest papers on the rotation curve of the Milky Way galaxy, i. e. Ou et al. (2024); Jiao et al. (2023); Sylos Labini et al. (2023) suggest a Keplerian decrease in the rotation curve. This behavior is not consistent with other spiral galaxies (Lelli et al. 2016; Mistele et al. 2024). Aims. Show that the prior use of the axisymmetric Jeans equation is not consistent with the final model produced in the papers. Methods. Comparison of the results on gravitational potential in Ou et al. (2024); Jiao et al. (2023); Sylos Labini et al. (2023) with the prior assumptions about the axisymemtric properties of the Milky Way galaxy. Results. The gravitational potentials published by Ou et al. (2024); Jiao et al. (2023); Sylos Labini et al. (2023) lead to almost spherically symmetric properties of the Milky Way galaxy at Galactocentric radii above 20 kpc, which is not consistent with the use of axisymmetric Jeans equations.

**Comment:** This paper revisits the Milky Way rotation curve and critiques the use of the axisymmetric Jeans equation. While it discusses the Milky Way's mass distribution, it does not focus on satellite galaxies, near-field cosmology, or any of the other core topics.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23069

**Authors:** Flavio Bombacigno, Fabio Moretti, Gonzalo J. Olmo

**Abstract:** We discuss the propagation of gravitational waves over a non-Riemannian spacetime, when a non-minimal coupling between the geometry and matter is considered in the form of contractions of the energy momentum tensor with the Ricci and co-Ricci curvature tensors. We focus our analysis on perturbations on a Minkowski background, elucidating how derivatives of the energy momentum tensor can sustain non-trivial torsion and non-metricity excitations, eventually resulting in additional source terms for the metric field. These can be reorganized in the form of D'Alembert operator acting on the energy momentum tensor and the equivalence principle can be reinforced at the linear level by a suitable choice of the parameters of the model. We show how tensor polarizations can exhibit a subluminal phase velocity in matter, evading the constraints found in General Relativity, and how this allows for the kinematic damping in specific configurations of the medium and of the geometry-matter coupling. These in turn define regions in the wavenumber space where propagation is forbidden, leading to the appearance of typical cut-off scale in the frequency spectrum.

**Comment:** This paper discusses gravitational waves in modified gravity theories with non-minimal geometry-matter coupling. It does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, dwarf galaxies, or galaxy simulations.

## 25. [Dynamical Love numbers of black holes: theory and gravitational waveforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22994) <a id="link25"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.22994

**Authors:** Sumanta Chakraborty, Valerio De Luca, Leonardo Gualtieri, Paolo Pani

**Abstract:** In General Relativity, the static tidal Love numbers of black holes vanish identically. Whether this remains true for time-dependent tidal fields -- i.e., in the case of dynamical tidal Love numbers -- is an open question, complicated by subtle issues in the definition and computation of the tidal response at finite frequency. In this work, we compute the dynamical tidal perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole to quadratic order in the tidal frequency. By employing the Teukolsky formalism in advanced null coordinates, which are regular at the horizon, we obtain a particularly clean perturbative scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a response function based on the full solution of the perturbation equation which does not depend on any arbitrary constant. Our analysis recovers known results for the dissipative response at linear order and the logarithmic running at quadratic order, associated with scale dependence in the effective theory. In addition, we find a finite, nonvanishing conservative correction at second-order in frequency, thereby possibly demonstrating a genuine dynamical deformation of the black hole geometry. We then assess the impact of these dynamical tidal effects on the gravitational-wave phase, which enter at 8th post-Newtonian order, and express the correction in terms of generic $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients, which have to be matched to the perturbative result. Despite their conceptual interest, we argue that such corrections are too small to be observable even with future-generation gravitational wave detectors. Moreover, the corresponding phase shifts are degenerate with unknown point-particle contributions entering at the same post-Newtonian order.

**Comment:** The paper is about tidal Love numbers of black holes and their impact on gravitational waveforms. It does not address any of the core topics such as galaxy evolution, dwarf galaxies, or stellar models.

## 26. [Gamma-Rays and Gravitational Waves from Inelastic Higgs Portal Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22975) <a id="link26"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.22975

**Authors:** Dan Hooper, Gordan Krnjaic, Duncan Rocha, Subhojit Roy

**Abstract:** We explore a simple and predictive dark matter scenario involving a complex scalar field, $\phi$, coupled to the Higgs portal with no additional field content. In the UV, the field possesses a global $U(1)$ symmetry which is broken by mass terms and Higgs portal interactions. In the mass basis, the complex field splits into a pair of real scalars with a small mass splitting (in analogy to pseudo-Dirac fermions), such that the Higgs portal acquires both diagonal and off-diagonal terms with respect to these eigenstates. In the parameter space where the off-diagonal interaction predominates, this scenario is safe from direct detection constraints. Moreover, this model provides a viable explanation for the longstanding Galactic Center gamma-ray excess. Additionally, this model influences the Higgs potential in a way that could facilitate a strong first-order electroweak phase transition in the early universe, potentially leading to a stochastic gravitational wave background that could fall within the reach of upcoming space-based detectors.

**Comment:** The paper discusses a dark matter model and its implications for gamma-ray and gravitational wave signals, including the Galactic Center excess. It does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, or galaxy simulations.

## 27. [A Comprehensive Study of the Energy and Redshift Distributions of the Fast Radio Burst Population Based on the First CHIME/FRB Catalog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23122) <a id="link27"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23122

**Authors:** Qing-Zhen Lei, Xin-Zhe Wang, Can-Min Deng

**Abstract:** Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief, high-energy bursts of radio waves from extragalactic sources, and their origin remains an open question. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the FRB population using the first CHIME/FRB catalog, focusing on their energy and redshift distribution, with careful consideration of selection effects. We investigate a range of models, including the Schechter function and the broken power-law function for the energy distribution, and several redshift evolution models, such as the star formation history (SFH) model, as well as models incorporating time delays relative to the SFH or additional redshift evolution factors. Our results indicate that the energy distribution of FRBs is best described by the Schechter function, with a power-law index of $\gamma = -1.49^{+0.37}_{-0.27}$ and a characteristic cutoff energy of $E_\mathrm{c} = 2.82^{+2.43}_{-1.47} \times 10^{41}$ erg. Furthermore, we find no evidence for redshift evolution in the energy distribution of FRBs. In terms of their redshift distribution, our analysis shows that it follows the cosmic SFH, without requiring additional delayed components or redshift evolution factors, suggesting that most FRBs likely originate from young stellar populations. Simultaneously, we infer a local volumetric rate of $\Phi_0 = 4.68^{+4.66}_{-2.39} \times 10^{4} \rm \ Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ for $E>10^{39}$ erg. These results, robust against CHIME observational biases, may provide new insights into the underlying properties of the FRB population.

**Comment:** This paper analyzes the energy and redshift distributions of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) using the CHIME/FRB catalog. While it discusses the cosmic star formation history (SFH) as a model for FRB redshift distribution, the focus is on FRBs as a population, not on galaxies, their resolved star formation histories, or near-field cosmology. No direct connection to dwarf galaxies, galaxy simulations, or outflows.

## 28. [Lord of LRDs: Insights into a "Little Red Dot'' with a low-ionization spectrum at z = 0.1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23774) <a id="link28"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23774

**Abstract:** Recent JWST observations have revealed a puzzling population of optically red and compact galaxies with peculiar "V"-shaped spectra at high redshift, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs are found at z > 4 and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early stages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at z = 0.1, which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in an JWST-selected LRD at z = 2.26. We find small but statistically significant variability in H$\alpha$ consistent with previous findings. Finally, with the new X-ray observation from NuSTAR, we confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with $N_{\rm H}>10^{24}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$. All evidence suggests SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 has a complex gaseous environment and the strong ionic, atomic, and molecular absorptions are hard to explain with typical stellar and AGN models.

**Comment:** This paper focuses on a local analog of 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), which are compact, red galaxies with AGN-like features. The study is primarily about AGN properties, spectral features, and the gaseous environment of a specific galaxy. There is no focus on dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, quenching, stellar models, galaxy simulations, outflows, or the CGM. The work is not relevant to the core topics.

## 29. [Origin of the ~150 kpc radio filament in galaxy ESO 137-006](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23026) <a id="link29"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23026

**Authors:** Toushif Alam, Kunal P. Mooley, Kartick C. Sarkar

**Abstract:** Sensitive wide-field radio surveys have started uncovering many filamentary structures associated with the jets and lobes of radio galaxies, radio relics in galaxy clusters, and tailed galaxies. Although limited theoretical investigations on the origin of the filamentary structures have associated these filaments with astrophysical shocks and interactions with intracluster magneto-ionic media, more quantitative studies are needed to ascertain their precise nature and origin. Recent MeerKAT observations found peculiar filamentary structures (threaded radio structures) joining the lobes of a nearby FRII-like galaxy, ESO 137-006. Here we investigate the origin of these "synchrotron threads" to understand if they may be confined magnetically and could arise due to shocks associated with jet activity. Through simulation- and theory-based analysis, we find that the dynamical time (~70 Myr) associated with the shock front closely matches the estimated synchrotron age (~130 Myr) of the threads, thus making the shock origin hypothesis a favorable scenario for this particular filament.

**Comment:** This paper investigates the origin of a ~150 kpc radio filament in a massive radio galaxy, focusing on shocks and synchrotron emission. The subject is a massive galaxy and its radio structures, not dwarf galaxies, star formation histories, or the other core topics.

## 30. [A Melody in the Noise: Modeling Echoes of the Crab Nebula](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23214) <a id="link30"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23214

**Authors:** Thierry Serafin Nadeau, Marten H. van Kerkwijk

**Abstract:** Pulses from the Crab pulsar are often followed by ``echoes'', produced by radiation that was deflected by small filamentary structures in the Crab nebula and thus traveled via longer paths. We describe a simplified but detailed model that treats the filaments as cylinders of dense, neutral material with a thin ionized skin. In this picture, echoes are produced when the line of sight crosses the skin at glancing incidence, which naturally leads to the large electron column density gradients required to get the observed delays even with electron densities comparable to those inferred from optical line emission ratios. We compare the properties of the predicted echoes with those of a relatively isolated observed one identified during daily monitoring with CHIME. We find that the delays of the simulated echoes follow closely the near quadratic evolution known to be a feature of these echoes, and that, unlike in previous models, we match the characteristic observed asymmetry between incoming and outgoing arcs, with the size of the gap in between a consequence of the skin crossing time. However, our model fails to quantitatively reproduce the magnifications of the echoes. We believe this likely is because the filaments are not as smooth as envisaged, so that a given echo results from many images. Nevertheless, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the nebula is filled with small-scale filamentary structures, which may well be substructures of the larger filaments that are seen in optical images.

**Comment:** This paper models radio echoes from the Crab Nebula, focusing on filamentary structures and their effect on pulsar signals. While it involves ISM structure, it does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, or galaxy simulations.

## 31. [Hierarchical Triples vs. Globular Clusters: Binary black hole merger eccentricity distributions compete and evolve with redshift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23212) <a id="link31"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23212

**Authors:** Andris Dorozsmai, Isobel M. Romero-Shaw, Aditya Vijaykumar, Silvia Toonen, Fabio Antonini, Kyle Kremer, Michael Zevin, Evgeni Grishin

**Abstract:** The formation mechanisms of merging binary black holes (BBHs) observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration remain uncertain. Detectable eccentricity provides a powerful diagnostic for distinguishing between different formation channels, but resolving their eccentricity distributions requires the detection of a large number of eccentric mergers. Future gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will detect tens of thousands of BBH mergers out to redshifts $z \ge 10$, making it critical to understand the redshift-dependent evolution of eccentricity distributions. We simulate this evolution for two key channels: dynamical assembly in globular clusters (GCs), which leads to rapid, eccentric mergers; and hierarchical triples in the field, where three-body dynamics can induce eccentricity in the inner binary. When considering all BBH mergers, the GC channel dominates overall, consistent with previous studies. However, when focusing on mergers with detectable eccentricity in next-generation detectors, we find that hierarchical triples dominate the eccentric merger rate at $0\le z \le 4$, with GC mergers becoming competitive at higher redshifts. Across all model variations, eccentric mergers in the local Universe ($z\lesssim 1$) have significant contributions from field triples, challenging the common view that such systems primarily form in dense environments. We show that, regardless of cluster and stellar evolution uncertainties, hierarchical triples contribute at least 30 per cent of eccentric mergers across a large range of redshifts.

**Comment:** This paper focuses on the eccentricity distributions of binary black hole mergers from different formation channels (globular clusters and hierarchical triples). While it involves numerical simulations and galaxy evolution, it does not focus on galaxies themselves, their satellites, star formation histories, or outflows. The topic is not directly related to any of the core criteria.

## 32. [Jet-Driven Formation of Bipolar Rings in Planetary Nebulae: Numerical Simulations Inspired by NGC 1514](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23670) <a id="link32"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23670

**Authors:** Muhammad Akashi (Technion, Israel), Ealeal Bear (Technion, Israel), Noam Soker (Technion, Israel)

**Abstract:** We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of jets launched into a dense shell, reproducing two rings in a bipolar structure that resemble the two dusty rings of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 1514. The scenario we simulate assumes that a strong binary interaction enhanced the mass loss rate from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar progenitor of NGC 1514, and shortly thereafter, the main-sequence companion accreted mass from the AGB star, launching a pair of jets. We find that adiabatic flows, where radiative losses are negligible, produce prominent rings, as observed in the infrared in NGC 1514. In contrast, when radiative cooling is significant, the rings are thin and faint. Our results reinforce the prevailing notion that jets play a substantial role in shaping planetary nebulae (PNe). More generally, as the binary companion to the central star of NGC 1514 avoided common envelope evolution, our results suggest that jets play a major role in many binary systems experiencing stable mass transfer at high rates. This conclusion complements the view that jets play a significant role in unstable mass transfer, specifically in common envelope evolution. Studies of strongly interacting binary systems, whether stable or not, should include jets. If jets continue to be active after ring formation, the outcomes are circum-jet rings, as observed in some other PNe and core-collapse supernova remnants.

**Comment:** This paper presents 3D hydrodynamical simulations of jet-driven ring formation in planetary nebulae, inspired by NGC 1514. While it involves numerical simulations, the focus is on planetary nebulae and binary interactions, not on galaxies or the core topics.

**Abstract:** We present the most up-to-date constraints on axion early dark energy (AEDE) from cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. In particular, we assess the impact of data from ground-based CMB experiments, the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) -- both with and without $Planck$ -- on constraints on AEDE. We also highlight the impact that BAO information from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has on these constraints. From CMB data alone, we do not find statistically significant evidence for the presence of AEDE, and we find only moderate reduction in the Hubble tension. From the latest SPT data alone, we find the maximal fractional contribution of AEDE to the cosmic energy budget is $f_{\rm EDE}\,<\,0.12$ at $95\,$% confidence level (CL), and the Hubble tension between the SPT and SH0ES results is reduced to the $2.3\,\sigma$ level. When combining the latest SPT, ACT, and $Planck$ datasets, we find $f_{\rm EDE}\,<\,0.091$ at $95\,$% CL and the Hubble tension at the $3.3\, \sigma$ level. In contrast, adding DESI data to the CMB datasets results in mild preference for AEDE and, in some cases, non-negligible reduction in the Hubble tension. From SPT+DESI, we find $f_{\rm EDE}\,=\,0.081^{+0.037}_{-0.052}$ at $68\,$% CL, and the Hubble tension reduces to $1.5\,\sigma$. From the combination of DESI with all three CMB experiments, we get $f_{\rm EDE}\,=\, 0.071^{+0.035}_{-0.038}$ at $68\,$% CL and a weak preference for AEDE over $\Lambda$CDM. This data combination, in turn, reduces the Hubble tension to $2.3\, \sigma$. We highlight that this shift in parameters when adding the DESI dataset is a manifestation of the discrepancy currently present between DESI and CMB experiments in the concordance model $\Lambda$CDM.

**Comment:** This paper presents constraints on axion early dark energy using CMB and BAO data, with a focus on cosmological parameters and the Hubble tension. It does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

## 34. [The Fate of Transonic Shocks around Black Holes and their Future Astrophysical Implications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23187) <a id="link34"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23187

**Authors:** Indu K. Dihingia, Akhil Uniyal, Yosuke Mizuno

**Abstract:** Theoretical models have long predicted the existence of shocks in multi-transonic accretion flows onto a black hole, yet their fate under realistic general relativistic simulations has not been fully tested. In this study, we present results from high-resolution two-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of low-angular-momentum accretion flows onto Kerr black holes, focusing on the formation of shocks in transonic accretion flow. We demonstrate that for specific combinations of energy and angular momentum, global shock solutions naturally emerge between multiple sonic points. These shocks are sustained in both corotating and counter-rotating cases, and their locations depend on specific energy, angular momentum, and the spin of the black hole which is in good agreement with analytical solutions. In magnetized flows, weak magnetic fields preserve the shock structure, whereas strong fields suppress it, enhancing turbulence and driving powerful, magnetically dominated jets/outflows. The strength and structure of the outflow also depend on a black hole spin and magnetization, with higher black hole spin parameters leading to faster jets. Shock solutions are found only in super-Alfv\'{e}nic regions, where kinetic forces dominate. Our findings provide important insights into the physics of hot corona formation and jet launching in low-angular-momentum accretion systems such as Sgr~A$^*$ (weak jet/outflow) and X-ray binaries.

**Comment:** The paper focuses on accretion flows and shock formation around black holes, with implications for jet launching in systems like Sgr A* and X-ray binaries. This is not related to galaxy-scale processes, near-field cosmology, or the other core topics.

## 35. [When First Beats Fast: Early Neutrino-Mass-Driven Flavor Instabilities in Supernovae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22985) <a id="link35"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.22985

**Authors:** Damiano F. G. Fiorillo, Hans-Thomas Janka, Georg G. Raffelt

**Abstract:** Collective neutrino flavor conversions in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) begin with instabilities, initially triggered when the dominant $\nu_e$ outflow concurs with a small flux of antineutrinos with the opposite lepton number, with $\overline{\nu}_e$ dominating over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$. When these "flipped" neutrinos emerge in the energy-integrated angular distribution (angular crossing), they initiate a fast instability. However, before such conditions arise, spectral crossings typically appear within $20~\mathrm{ms}$ of collapse, i.e., local spectral excesses of $\overline{\nu}_e$ over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ along some direction. Therefore, post-processing SN simulations cannot consistently capture later fast instabilities because the early slow ones have already altered the conditions.

**Comment:** The paper discusses neutrino flavor instabilities in core-collapse supernovae. While supernovae are important for galaxy evolution, the focus here is on neutrino physics, not on galaxy-scale processes, star formation histories, or outflows.

## 37. [On the Origin of Ultra-high-energy Cosmic Rays Assuming a Heavy Mass Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23385) <a id="link37"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23385

**Authors:** Alena Bakalov\'a, Ana Laura M\"uller, Jakub V\'icha

**Abstract:** Recent studies, supported by updated hadronic interaction models, suggest that the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays may be heavier than previously assumed. This has significant implications for source identification, as the deflections of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) are larger for heavy primaries than for lighter ones at the same energy. In this work, we assume that cosmic rays above 40 EeV consist of iron nuclei only and investigate their possible sources through simulations of cosmic ray propagation, including interactions with ambient photon fields and deflections in the GMF using multiple models. We consider two types of sources as potential origins of these cosmic rays, active galactic nuclei and starburst galaxies. We compare the predicted distributions of arrival directions from sources within 250 Mpc with the measured arrival directions of cosmic rays above 40 EeV. Our results indicate that stronger correlation is found for the active galactic nuclei scenario compared to starburst galaxies. However, we find that within our heavy mass composition model, the GMF leads to significant deflections, making source identification challenging with current knowledge and tools, even at the highest energies.

**Comment:** This paper investigates the sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays under the assumption of a heavy mass composition. The focus is on cosmic ray propagation and source identification, not on any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, or galaxy simulations.

**Abstract:** The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (``Roman'') is a 2.4m space telescope scheduled for a 2026 launch. The Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) on Roman is a technology-demonstration instrument with a coronagraph and, for the first time in space, deformable mirrors and active wavefront control. This paper walks through the algorithmic and system-level architecture of the HOWFSC implementation for CGI, including the use of ground-in-the-loop (GITL) operations to support computationally-expensive operations, and reports on instrument performance measured during thermal vacuum testing in instrument integration and test. CGI achieved better than $5\times10^{-8}$ total raw contrast with two independent coronagraph architectures covering 3-9 and 6-20 $\lambda/D$ between them and a $360^{\circ}$ dark hole on each. The contrast limits appear to be driven by time available for testing, and do not appear to represent a floor in the achievable performance of CGI in flight.

**Abstract:** This work presents a novel cosmic-ray scattering experiment employing a Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) muon tomography system. By introducing the scattering angle between incident and outgoing cosmic-ray tracks as a key observable, this approach enables simultaneous studies of secondary cosmic-ray composition and searching for new physics. During a 63-day campaign, 1.18 million cosmic ray scattering events were recorded and analyzed. By performing combined template fits to the observed angular distribution, particle abundances are measured, for example, resolving the electron component at $\sim 2\%$ precision. Furthermore, constraints are established on elastic muon-dark matter (DM) scattering cross-sections for muon-philic dark matter. At the 95\% confidence level, the limit reaches 1.62 $\times$ $10^{-17}$ $\rm{cm}^{2}$ for 1 GeV slow DM, demonstrating sensitivity limit to light muon-coupled slow DM.

## 40. [Neural Posterior Estimation of Neutron Star Equations of State](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23506) <a id="link40"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23506

**Authors:** Val\'eria Carvalho, M\'arcio Ferreira, Micha{\l} Bejger, Constan\c{c}a Provid\^encia

**Abstract:** We present a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) from astrophysical observations of masses, radii and tidal deformabilities, using Neural posterior estimation (NPE) with Conditional Normalising Flows (CNF). To ensure that the model conforms with reality, physics-informed constraints are embedded directly into the training loss. This enables efficient, likelihood-free inference of full posterior distributions for key thermodynamic quantities-including pressure, squared speed of sound, and the trace anomaly-conditioned on observational data. Our models are trained on synthetic datasets generated from two agnostic EoS priors: polytropic parametrizations (PT) and gaussian process (GP) reconstructions. These datasets span various scenarios, including the presence or absence of tidal deformability information and observational noise. Across all settings, the method produces accurate and well-calibrated posteriors, with uncertainties reduced when tidal deformability constraints are included. Furthermore, we find that the behavior of normalized predictive dispersions is strongly correlated with the maximum central density inside NSs, suggesting that the model can indirectly infer this physically meaningful quantity. The approach generalizes well across EoS families and accurately reconstructs derivative quantities such as the polytropic index, demonstrating its robustness and potential for probing dense matter in NS cores.

**Abstract:** We present a catalogue of 3557 Double Radio sources associated with Active Galactic Nuclei (DRAGNs) from the First Pilot Survey of the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU), observed at 944 MHz with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope, covering 270 deg^2. We have extracted and identified each source by eye, tagged it with a morphological type and measured its parameters. The resulting catalogue will be used in subsequent papers to explore the properties of these sources, to train machine-learning algorithms for the detection of these sources in larger fields, and to compare with the results of Citizen Science projects, with the ultimate goal of understanding the physical processes that drive DRAGNs. Compared with earlier, lower sensitivity, catalogues, we find more diffuse structure and a plethora of more complex structures, ranging from wings of radio emission on the side of the jets, to types of object which have not been seen in earlier observations. As well as the well-known FR1 and FR2 sources, we find significant numbers of rare types of radio source such as Hybrid Morphology Radio Sources and one-sided jets, as well as a wide range of bent-tail and head-tail sources.

**Comment:** This is a catalog of Double Radio sources associated with Active Galactic Nuclei (DRAGNs) from the EMU survey. The focus is on AGN-driven radio sources, not on dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations. No direct relevance to the core topics.

## 42. [MeerKAT 1.3 GHz Observations of the Wide Angle Tail Radio Galaxy J1712$-$2435](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23463) <a id="link42"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23463

**Authors:** William Cotton, Gourab Giri, P. J. Agnihotri, D. J. Saikia, K. Thorat, F. Camilo

**Abstract:** We present full polarization MeerKAT images of the wide-angle tail, giant radio galaxy J1712$-$2435 at 1.3 GHz with 7.\asec5 resolution and an RMS sensitivity of 8 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Due to the angular proximity to the Galactic Center (l=359.6$^\circ$, b=+8.5$^\circ$) the immediate environment is not well understood but there are massive clusters nearby. Emission can be traced over an extent of 34.\amin6 which at the redshift of 0.024330 corresponds to a projected length of 1.02 Mpc. The inner jets are quite straight but then bend and completely decollimate into extended plumes nearly orthogonal to the initial jet directions at a projected distance of approximately 100 kpc. The nearly unity brightness ratio of the inner jets suggest that they are orientated within a few degrees of the plane of the sky. The 1400 MHz power is 3.9$\times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, somewhat below the FRI/FRII divide. The total power emitted is estimated to be 5.6$\times 10^{41}$ erg sec$^{-1}$ over the range 10 MHz to 100 GHz. The source dynamics are modeled with magneto-hydrodynamics simulations; the result is a rough reproduction of the source's radio morphology / appearance. This study further highlights the merit of alternative scenarios, calling for future observational and numerical efforts.

**Comment:** This paper focuses on the radio morphology and dynamics of a giant radio galaxy, using MHD simulations to model jet behavior. The subject is a massive galaxy, not a dwarf or satellite, and the focus is on AGN jets rather than star formation, quenching, or near-field cosmology. No relevant criteria are matched.

**Abstract:** We present the results of the further investigation of the Class II methanol maser emission in the $14_1 - 14_0$ A$^{-+}$ transition at 349.1 GHz discovered in 2016 in the remarkable core S255IR-SMA1, harboring a $\sim$20 M$_\odot$ protostar NIRS3, which exhibited a disk-mediated accretion burst in 2015. The present study is based on the observations of this object with ALMA in Band 7 at the largest baselines, which provide the angular resolution of $\sim$15 mas. We estimated physical conditions in the region from which comes the maser emission, and in the surroundings, using the presumably quasi-thermal methanol lines in our bands and the CH$_3$CN $19_\mathrm{K} - 18_\mathrm{K}$ line series. The total flux density in the $14_1 - 14_0$ A$^{-+}$ line in 2021 is about two times higher than in 2019. A maser emission of about the same intensity in 2021 is detected for the first time in the $12_1 - 12_0$ A$^{-+}$ transition at 336.9 GHz. The physical conditions in the masering and non-masering regions are similar. The masers are apparently excited by the radiation of the central source. Unfortunately, the existing models cannot adequately take into account this radiation. The $18_{-3}-17_{-4}$ E transition at 345.919 GHz shows characteristics of maser emission, too.

## 44. [The Impact of Foregrounds on Dark Ages Measurements with the Highly Redshifted 21 cm Line](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22993) <a id="link44"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.22993

**Authors:** Jonathan C. Pober, Willow Smith

**Abstract:** Studies of the cosmic dark ages ($30 \lesssim z \lesssim 150$) using the highly redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen offer unparalleled amounts of cosmological information, and recent years have seen the refinement of concepts for such experiments (e.g. CoDEX and FarView), nominally feasible with technology and resources in the next one to two decades. This work studies how the "foreground wedge" -- a term in the 21 cm cosmology literature referring to the contamination of power spectrum modes through the combination of smooth-spectrum foreground emission and the frequency-dependent point spread function of a radio interferometer -- manifests at these very high redshifts. We find the effect is more significant than at Epoch of Reionization redshifts targeted by current ground-based experiments, with foreground avoidance techniques (which discard all $k$ modes falling within the wedge) typically losing an order of magnitude of sensitivity. Given the extreme faintness of the 21 cm signal from the cosmic dark ages and the very high sky temperatures (the dominant source of noise) at low radio frequencies, we conclude that some level of foreground subtraction will be necessary to enable dark ages 21 cm cosmology with experiments of the scale believed to be achievable in the near term.

**Authors:** Zachary J. Hoelscher, Thomas W. Kephart, Kelly Holley-Bockelmann

**Abstract:** The values of the Hubble constant inferred from local measurements and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) exhibit an approximately 5 sigma tension. Some have suggested this tension is alleviated if matter is converted to dark radiation via dark matter decay. As it is not clear that dark matter decays, we instead examine the effects of converting matter to gravitational radiation via black hole mergers. We consider mergers of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), mergers of stellar-mass black holes, and the formation of SMBHs from mergers of smaller black holes. We find that these processes cannot alleviate the tension, as an unrealistically large merger rate, or an overproduction of SMBHs is required. We also consider whether one can use the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect to constrain mechanisms that form SMBHs from mergers of smaller black holes. We find that this is also too small to be viable.

**Comment:** This paper examines the cosmological impact of black hole mergers on the Hubble tension. It is focused on cosmological parameters and black hole populations, not on galaxies, their satellites, or star formation processes.

## 46. [Mass Determination of Supermassive Black Holes Governing Evolution of Radio Emitters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23161) <a id="link46"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23161

**Authors:** Kimitake Hayasaki, Ryo Yamazaki

**Abstract:** Tidal disruption events (TDEs) involving supermassive black holes (SMBHs) often exhibit radio emission, yet its physical origin remains uncertain, especially in non-jetted cases. In this Letter, we formulate a general dynamical framework for a radio-emitting shell driven by disk winds and expanding through a power-law ambient medium under the influence of SMBH gravity. We derive and classify power-law-in-time solutions to the governing equations in the adiabatic regime. In particular, a universal $t^{2/3}$ scaling emerges naturally when gravitational energy dominates or is comparable to thermal energy, irrespective of the ambient density profile, whereas the classical Sedov-Taylor solution is recovered when gravity is negligible. Our analysis reveals that, in regimes where SMBH gravity governs the shell expansion, the SMBH mass can be inferred from radio observations of the shell. This approach is independent of and complementary to conventional mass estimators, with direct implications for interpreting radio-emitting TDEs and probing SMBH demographics. Our formalism further predicts that 10-100 GHz monitoring with existing and planned facilities can yield SMBH masses within months of disruption, providing a time-domain analogue to reverberation mapping.

**Comment:** This paper focuses on mass determination of supermassive black holes in the context of tidal disruption events (TDEs) and radio emission. TDEs and SMBHs are explicitly listed as irrelevant in the criteria.

**Abstract:** The balloon-borne hard X-ray polarimetry mission XL-Calibur observed the Black Hole X-ray Binary (BHXRB) Cygnus X-1 (Cyg X-1) during its nearly six-day Long Duration Balloon (LDB) flight from Sweden to Canada in July 2024. The XL-Calibur observations allowed us to derive the most precise constraints to date of the Polarization Degree (PD) and Polarization Angle (PA) of the hard X-ray emission from a BHXRB. XL-Calibur observed Cyg X-1 in the hard state and measured a $\sim$19-64 keV PD of ($5.0^{+2.7}_{-3.0}$)% at a PA of $-28^{\circ}\pm 17^{\circ}$, with an 8.7% chance probability of detecting larger PDs than the one observed, given an unpolarized signal. The XL-Calibur results are thus comparable to the 2-8 keV PD and PA found by IXPE, with a similar agreement between the hard X-ray PA and the radio jet direction. We also discuss the implications of our polarization measurements in the context of models describing the origin of the broadband X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission, to which XL-Calibur provides independent constraints on any proposed emission modeling.

**Comment:** This paper presents X-ray polarimetry of the black hole X-ray binary Cyg X-1. The focus is on constraining the origin of hard-state X-ray emission in a black hole binary, not on galaxies, star formation histories, or near-field cosmology.

**Authors:** Thierry Serafin Nadeau, Marten H. van Kerkwijk, Jing Luo, Robert Main, Kiyoshi W. Masui, James W. McKee, Ue-Li Pen

**Abstract:** The Crab Pulsar is known to feature plasma lensing events known as echoes. These events show additional components in the pulse profile which are produced by signal that is deflected by ionized nebular material and are therefore delayed relative to the primary emission. We observed the Crab pulsar with \ac{CHIME} during its daily transits, creating an archive of baseband recordings of bright single pulses (known as giant pulses) in the 400$-800\,\unit{MHz}$ band. From these, we produced daily stacks of aligned pulses between late October 2021 and March 2024. We find that in these averages, echoes are readily visible throughout the observation period, and we identify clear groups of echoes with distinct behaviour in terms of their evolution with time and frequency. Many echoes exhibit dispersive delays consistent with being observed through excess column densities relative to the unscattered rays, but we also find two events where the dispersive delays indicate column density deficits. For the first time, we also find echoes for which the line of sight never directly intersects the intervening structures, resulting in events with non-zero minimum delays, of around ${0.5 \rm\,ms}$. The frequency and diversity of the observed echoes make the Crab an excellent target for long-term studies of astrophysical plasma lensing.

**Abstract:** Cosmological collider physics allows the detection of heavy particles at inflationary scales through their imprints on primordial non-Gaussianities. We study the chemical potential mechanism applied to a pair of charged scalars. We analytically evaluate the resulting one-loop contribution to the bispectrum, using the spectral decomposition. In this way we are able to determine the parametric dependences for both the signal and the background. We show that a signal strength $f_{\mathrm{NL}}\sim O(0.01)$ can be obtained within theoretical control, potentially reachable by 21cm tomography. As an application we consider the colored Higgs bosons in $\mathrm{SU}(5)$ supersymmetric orbifold grand unification with masses $M\lesssim10^{15}\:\mathrm{GeV}$.

**Comment:** This paper is about cosmological collider physics and the detection of heavy particles via primordial non-Gaussianities, which is not related to any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

**Authors:** Yu Song, Yehui Hou, Lei Huang, Bin Chen

**Abstract:** Improved observational precision in relativistic jets has underscored the need for tractable theoretical models. In this study, we construct a semi-analytical hybrid jet model that incorporates both black hole-driven and disk-driven components within the framework of steady, axisymmetric, ideal MHD. We derive a condition that determines the launching sites of cold outflows, introducing a new constraint on the magnetic field configuration threading the accretion disk. Using the Bernoulli equation and critical point analysis, we derive flow solutions along various magnetic field lines. Our hybrid jet model shows that discontinuities in field-line angular velocity lead to clear velocity shear and density jumps at the interface between the two jet components. These features are accompanied by localized enhancements in velocity and density, potentially explaining the observed limb-brightening.

**Comment:** This paper presents a semi-analytical MHD model for hybrid black hole-disk driven jets, focusing on jet launching and structure. The work is not related to near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23320

**Authors:** Yuma S. Furuta, Yuta Hamada, Kazunori Kohri

**Abstract:** We investigate the extent to which the Swampland Conjecture can be employed to constrain large-field inflationary models from the perspective of quantum gravity consistency. In particular, we focus on the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which imposes an upper bound on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves predicted by large-field inflation scenarios. This provides a striking contrast with the well-known Lyth bound, which yields a lower bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio in such models. The two bounds thus play complementary roles in assessing the viability of inflationary scenarios. We demonstrate that, for certain representative large-field inflation models, the Swampland Distance Conjecture alone can impose more stringent upper limits on the tensor-toscalar ratio than current observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background. These findings highlight the utility of Swampland criteria as a theoretical discriminator among competing inflationary models, independent of empirical data.

**Comment:** This paper focuses on inflationary models and the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which are topics in early universe cosmology and quantum gravity, not near-field cosmology or any of the other specified relevant topics.

**Abstract:** The estimation of CME arrival time strongly depends on the CME propagation models in interplanetary space and the geometrical aspects of the CME model. We conducted ensemble simulations of CMEs propagation with various elliptical cone shapes to study the relation between the CME speed and the optimum cone shape. We numerically searched for the best elliptical aspect ratio of the elliptical cone for each CME in our CME-ICME pair data. We found that the fast CMEs tend to have a higher elliptical aspect ratio (more circular) than the slower CMEs (flattened). Our results suggest that a fast CME gives a stronger push to all directions, which results in a more circular shape of the leading-edge. We believe that this velocity-dependent behavior is related to the different Lorentz force strengths during the early expansion of a CME.

**Comment:** This paper focuses on coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in interplanetary space, which is unrelated to galaxy evolution, near-field cosmology, or any of the specified core topics.

## 53. [T CrB: overview of the accretion history, Roche-lobe filling, orbital solution, and radiative modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23323) <a id="link53"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23323

**Authors:** U. Munari, F. Walter, N. Masetti, P. Valisa, S. Dallaporta, A. Bergamini, G. Cherini, A. Frigo, A. Maitan, C. Marino, G. Mazzacurati, S. Moretti, F. Tabacco, S. Tomaselli, A. Vagnozzi, P. Ochner, I. Albanese

**Abstract:** (abridged) We aim to derive a robust estimate of the most important parameters describing the physical nature of T CrB, trace the accretion history onto its white dwarf, and account for the unexpected delay in the occurrence of the new outburst: the SAP prior to 1946 was brighter, and it was followed by the nova eruption within 6 months from its conclusion. This time the 2015-2023 SAP has been fainter and two years past its conclusion no new eruption has yet taken place. During 2005-2025, a period covering SAP and the preceding quiescence, we collected a massive amount of photometric and spectroscopic observations that we have analyzed together with Swift UVOT data. Guided by the results of the orbital solution and in particular by the radiative modeling to which we subjected the whole set of available data, we found for T CrB a binary period of 227.5528 days, an inclination of 61 deg, and masses of 1.35 Msun and 0.93 Msun for the white dwarf and the M3III companion, respectively, making mass transfer dynamically stable. The red giant fills completely its Roche lobe, and at Vrot sin(i)=4.75 +-0.26 km/s it is rotating much slower that the 16 km/s co-rotation value. The ~20 deg azimuth of the hot spot, implied by the hump shaping the optical light curve in quiescence, fixes the outer radius of the disk to 58 Rsun, the same as the canonical value expected from disk theory. In quiescence the disk is cold and mostly neutral. SAP has been caused by an inside-out collapse of the disk, during which the mean accretion rate onto the WD has been ~28x larger than in quiescence. SAP ended in April 2023, but from May 2024 mass-flow has intensively resumed at disk inner radii while the collapse wave reached the outer portions of the disk; the consequent revamp in mass accretion could fill the gap inherited by the fainter 2015-2023 SAP and eventually lead the WD accreted shell to ignition.

**Comment:** This paper provides an overview of the accretion history, Roche-lobe filling, and radiative modeling of the symbiotic binary T CrB. The focus is on binary evolution and accretion processes, not on galaxies, star formation histories, or near-field cosmology.

## 54. [Lepton number crossings are insufficient for flavor instabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22987) <a id="link54"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.22987

**Authors:** Damiano F. G. Fiorillo, Georg G. Raffelt

**Abstract:** In dense neutrino environments, the mean field of flavor coherence can develop instabilities. A necessary condition is that the flavor lepton number changes sign as a function of energy and/or angle. Whether such a crossing is also sufficient has been a longstanding question. We construct an explicit counterexample: a spectral crossing without accompanying flavor instability, with an even number of crossings being key. This failure is physically understood as Cherenkov-like emission of flavor waves. If flipped-lepton-number neutrinos never dominate among those kinematically allowed to decay, the waves cannot grow.

**Comment:** This paper discusses flavor instabilities in dense neutrino environments, a topic in neutrino physics and not related to galaxies, star formation, or any of the core topics.

## 55. [Disentangling spinning and nonspinning binary black hole populations with spin sorting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23663) <a id="link55"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23663

**Authors:** Lillie Szemraj, Sylvia Biscoveanu

**Abstract:** The individual component spins of binary black holes (BBH) are difficult to resolve using gravitational-wave observations but carry key signatures of the processes shaping their formation and evolution. Recent analyses have found conflicting evidence for a sub-population of black holes with negligible spin, but the Default spin magnitude population model used in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analyses cannot formally accommodate an excess of systems with zero spin. In this work, we analyze several different simulated BBH populations to demonstrate that even in the face of this mismodeling, spinning and nonspinning populations can be reliably distinguished using the Default spin magnitude population model coupled with spin sorting. While typical analyses sort the binary components by their masses, sorting the components by their spin magnitudes instead offers a complementary view of the properties of individual systems consistent with equal mass and of population-level properties, given binary evolution processes like tidal-spin up that predict asymmetric spin magnitudes among the binary components. We conclude that current observations of the BBH population are inconsistent with a fully nonspinning population, but could be explained by a population with only one spinning black hole per binary or a population with up to 80% nonspinning sources.

**Comment:** This paper analyzes the spin properties of binary black holes using gravitational-wave data. It does not address galaxies, star formation, or any of the relevant criteria.

## 56. [On the Interpretation of Velocity Residuals in Protoplanetary Disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23287) <a id="link56"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23287

**Authors:** Masataka Aizawa, Ryuta Orihara

**Abstract:** We present a first-order analytical model for line-of-sight velocity residuals, defined as the difference between observed velocities and those predicted by a fiducial model, assuming a flared, nearly axisymmetric disk with the perturbations in disk surface height $\delta h(r)$, inclination $\delta i(r)$, and position angle $\delta\mathrm{PA}(r)$. Introducing projection-deprojection mapping between sky-plane and disk-frame coordinates, we demonstrate that the normalized velocity residuals exhibit Fourier components up to the third harmonic ($\sin3\phi$ and $\cos3\phi$). Moreover, we show that the radial profiles of $\delta h(r)$, $\delta i(r)$, and $\delta\mathrm{PA}(r)$ can be uniquely recovered from the data by solving a linear inverse problem. For comparison, we highlight factors that are not considered in previous models. We also outline how our framework can be extended beyond the first-order residuals and applied to additional observables, such as line intensities and widths.

**Comment:** This paper presents an analytical model for interpreting velocity residuals in protoplanetary disks. It does not address galaxies, star formation histories, or any of the relevant criteria.

## 57. [Polarization properties of thermal accretion disk emission. I. Direct radiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23379) <a id="link57"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23379

**Authors:** L. Marra, J. Podgorn\'y, R. Taverna, G. Matt, S. Bianchi, M. Dov\v{c}iak, R. Goosmann

**Abstract:** The X-ray polarimetric observing window re-opening is shedding new light on our current understanding of compact accreting sources. This is true, in particular, for stellar-mass black hole sources observed in the thermally-dominated state, for which the polarization signal is expected to depend on the accretion disk inclination and the black hole spin. Two main effects determine the polarization properties of the accretion disk emission: the absorption and scattering processes occurring before the radiation leaves the disk atmosphere, and the relativistic effects influencing its propagation towards the observer at infinity. In this work, we investigate these effects together considering only the contribution of direct radiation. We analyze how the ionization state of the disk atmosphere, approximated with a constant-density surface layer assumed to be either in collisional ionization equilibrium or photoionization equilibrium, can influence the spectro-polarimetric properties of the radiation at the emitting disk surface. Subsequently we study how these are modified by the propagation in a strong gravitational field.

**Comment:** This paper focuses on the polarization properties of thermal accretion disk emission around stellar-mass black holes, which is not related to any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, dwarf galaxies, resolved star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

## 58. [X-ray polarization of reflected thermal emission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23687) <a id="link58"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23687

**Authors:** J. Podgorn\'y, M. Dov\v{c}iak, R. Goosmann, F. Marin, L. Marra, G. Matt, A. R\'o\.za\'nska, R. Taverna

**Abstract:** X-ray thermal emission is inherent in neutron-star and black-hole X-ray binary systems. Within these systems, it may reflect from optically thick matter, which will create characteristic observable X-ray spectro-polarimetric features. We compute rest-frame reflection spectra and the corresponding energy-dependent linear polarization degree and angle for (un)polarized single-temperature black-body spectra impinging on a partially ionized constant-density optically thick slab. We use a combination of a Monte Carlo simulation that takes into account scattering, absorption, and spectral lines, with a non-LTE radiative transfer pre-computation of the ionization structure of the slab in photo-ionization equilibrium. We discuss the impact of the reflector's ionization and of the incident spectral shape on the obtained energy dependence of polarization. Despite the presence of highly polarized absorption features and low-polarized spectral lines, an underlying scattering-induced increase of polarization degree with energy in mid to hard X-rays naturally arises due to multiple Compton-scattering energy shifts. Such re-processing effect is particularly apparent in 2-8 keV for steep incident X-ray spectra reflecting from highly-ionized optically thick media. Integration of the resulting local reflection tables in specific large-scale reflection geometries occurring in X-ray binary systems, including relativistic effects, will be presented in a follow-up paper. Nonetheless, we anticipate that the obtained local energy-dependent features will imprint at large distances from the source to the observed X-ray polarization, and could contribute to the observed increase of total polarization degree with energy in 2-8 keV in many accreting systems by the IXPE mission.

**Comment:** This paper models X-ray polarization from reflected thermal emission in X-ray binaries, focusing on radiative transfer and polarization features. It does not address any of the core topics such as near-field cosmology, star formation histories, or galaxy simulations.

## 59. [Doubly regular black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23250) <a id="link59"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.23250

**Authors:** Arthur G. Suvorov, Pedro Bargue\~no

**Abstract:** In addition to curvature singularities, electrovacuum black holes in general relativity exhibit thermodynamic singularities. These so-called Davies' points occur at non-extremal values of charge and spin where the heat capacity diverges and may indicate a type of theoretical incompleteness. The thermodynamic regularity of several families of static, asymptotically-flat spacetimes with bounded curvature invariants is examined using a theory-agnostic framework, showing that while they may be regular in physical space they are generally not in phase space. The inclusion of angular momentum, via the Newman-Janis algorithm, makes the set of such "doubly regular" objects especially restrictive. It is argued that, if thermodynamic regularity is to be considered a desirable property for an astrophysical black hole, these considerations could be used to narrow down the viable pool of regular extensions to the Kerr-Newman metric.

**Comment:** This is a theoretical study of black hole solutions and their thermodynamic properties. It does not relate to galaxies, star formation, or any of the core topics.

**Authors:** Rasha Abbasi (for the IceCube Collaboration), Paolo Desiati (for the IceCube Collaboration), Juan Carlos D\'iaz V\'elez (for the IceCube Collaboration), Frank McNally (for the IceCube Collaboration)

**Abstract:** This study presents preliminary results from the analysis of cosmic-ray anisotropy using air showers detected by the IceTop surface array between 2011 and 2022. With improved statistical precision and updated Monte Carlo simulation events compared to previous IceTop reports, we investigate anisotropy patterns across four energy ranges spanning from 300 TeV to 6.9 PeV. This work extends the measurement of cosmic-ray anisotropy in the southern hemisphere to higher energies than previously achieved with IceTop. Our results provide a foundation for exploring potential connections between the observed anisotropy, the energy spectrum, and the mass composition of the cosmic-ray flux.

**Comment:** The paper analyzes cosmic-ray anisotropy using IceTop data. It does not address galaxies, star formation, quenching, or any of the specified relevant topics.

**Abstract:** We present an analysis of new multi-wavelength observations of the TeV gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057, conducted using SALT, Swift, NuSTAR, and VERITAS in 2023--2024. By combining these new data with archival observations, we confirm previous suggestions of orbital variability in the source's X-ray spectrum, including increased X-ray absorption at the orbital phase interval of $\phi\approx0.3\textrm{--}0.4$. The source's X-ray flux within this phase interval seems to have exhibited a significant change on an orbital timescale. Additionally, occasional short-term variations in the X-ray band on a timescale of less than 3 days have been observed. The measured duration of the increased absorbing column density and the flux variability timescales can provide clues about the interaction between the putative pulsar and the Be companion's disk if, as previously suggested, the pulsar crosses the disk at this phase interval. Moreover, the new contemporaneous X-ray and TeV observations around the pulsar-crossing phases revealed independent variability in the X-ray and TeV fluxes, contrary to a previous observation of concurrent flux increases. While these observations alone cannot provide definitive conclusions, we discuss our results in the context of pulsar-disk interaction and intrabinary shock emission scenarios.

**Comment:** The paper presents a multi-wavelength study of a gamma-ray binary, focusing on pulsar-disk interactions and X-ray/TeV variability. It does not address galaxies, star formation histories, quenching, or near-field cosmology.

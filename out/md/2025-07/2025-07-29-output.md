## 1. [Observed Timescales of Stellar Feedback in Star-Forming, Low-Mass Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19573) <a id="link1"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.19573

**Authors:** Laura C. Hunter, Liese van Zee, Roger E. Cohen, Kristen B. McQuinn, Madison Markham, Justin A. Kader, Lexi N. Gault, Andrew E. Dolphin

**Abstract:** Understanding the timescales of atomic gas turbulence is crucial to understanding the interplay between star formation and the interstellar medium (ISM). To investigate the timescales of turbulence low-mass galaxies ($10^{6.8}$100 Myr ago, and the HI turbulence properties, may be related to the time scales over which turbulence decays in the ISM. Additionally, the results demonstrate a possible difference in the global and local turbulence properties of low-mass galaxies.

## 2. [Unveiling the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy Core with Gaia DR3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20212) <a id="link2"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.20212

**Authors:** Ellie K. H. Toguchi-Tani, Daniel R. Hey, Thomas de Boer, Peter M. Frinchaboy, Daniel Huber

**Abstract:** The Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy provides us with the unique opportunity to study an ongoing Galactic cannibalistic event between our Milky Way Galaxy and a satellite dwarf galaxy. We present the first major membership star catalog of the Sagittarius dwarf core ($\approx$400,000 sources) and Messier 54 ($\approx$2000 sources) with positions, proper motions, and parallaxes from $Gaia$ DR3, supplemented with metallicities from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment. We isolate the Sagittarius dwarf core (3.7 core radii) and Messier 54 (0.125 core radii) using literature positions. Using evolutionary sub-samples separated within a color-magnitude diagram, we analyze the structures and substructures of the Sagittarius core and infer its positional relationship with Messier 54 within 5D phase space. A sample of Milky Way stars from a similar galactic latitude was used to identify contaminants and separate member stars from the core of the Sgr dSph and Messier 54 using a Gaussian distribution in proper motion space. We present the derived proper motion, parallaxes, and metallicities for these evolutionary sub-samples while demonstrating the precision of our sample using red clump standard candles. We find a distance modulus for the Sagittarius core and Messier 54 of $(m-M)_{0}=17.002^{+0.038}_{-0.042}$ mag and $(m-M)_{0}=17.011^{+0.038}_{-0.039}$ mag, corresponding to a heliocentric distance of $d=25.14^{+0.45}_{-0.48}$ kpc and $d=25.25^{+0.48}_{-0.45}$ kpc respectively. With red clump distance analysis, our results imply there is no separation between the Sagittarius core and Messier 54.

**Comment:** Directly studies the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, a Milky Way satellite, using Gaia DR3 data. Focuses on membership, structure, and substructure of the Sagittarius core and its relationship with Messier 54, which is highly relevant to near-field cosmology and the study of Milky Way satellite galaxies.

## 3. [Do Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies Follow the Globular Cluster-Halo Mass Relation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20687) <a id="link3"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.20687

**Authors:** Duncan A. Forbes, Jonah S. Gannon

**Abstract:** The stellar mass-halo mass relation and the globular cluster (GC) number-halo mass relation are two scaling relations that relate fundamental properties of normal galaxies. Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs), some of which, have rich GC systems and relatively low stellar masses can not follow the mean trend of both relations simultaneously; it is thus important to understand which relationship is followed by UDGs. Using independent halo masses determined from kinematic fitting to large radii, we identify three UDGs and two UDG-like galaxies from the literature and examine which scaling relation they follow. We find that the galaxies follow the GC number-halo mass relation but deviate in a systematic way from the stellar mass-halo mass relation, which depends on their GC count. This scatter off the relation is towards higher halo masses, or equivalently lower stellar masses. The galaxies exhibiting the largest offsets may represent `failed galaxies' that have experienced quenched star formation with later assembly.

**Comment:** This paper focuses on ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), their globular cluster systems, and their relation to dark matter halo mass—directly relevant to near-field cosmology, satellite luminosity functions, and the study of low-mass galaxies' dark matter content. The discussion of 'failed galaxies' and deviations from scaling relations is highly aligned with the core topics.

## 4. [Efficient semi-analytic modelling of Pop III star formation from Cosmic Dawn to Reionization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19581) <a id="link4"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.19581

**Authors:** Sahil Hegde, Steven R. Furlanetto

**Abstract:** The quest to find the first stars has driven astronomers across cosmic time, from hopes to identify their signatures in their heyday at cosmic dawn to deep searches for their remnants in our local neighborhood. Such work crucially relies on robust theoretical modelling to understand when and where we expect pristine star formation to have occurred and survived. To that end, here we introduce an analytic bathtub for cosmic dawn, the abcd model, to efficiently trace the formation of the first stars from their birth through the first billion years of our universe's history, jointly following star formation out of pristine and metal-enriched gas over time. Informed by the latest theoretical developments in our understanding of star formation in molecular cooling halos, metal mixing, and early galaxies, we expand pre-existing minimal models for galaxy formation to include Population III stars and many of the processes - both internal and environmental - affecting their evolution, while remaining fast and interpretable. With this framework, we can bridge the gap between numerical simulations and previous semi-analytic models, as we self-consistently follow star formation in dark matter halos from the minihalo era through the epoch of reionization, finding that, under plausible physical conditions, pristine star formation can persist at a high level in the presence of Pop II star formation down to $z\sim 5$, but is limited to the most massive halos. We highlight areas of theoretical uncertainty in the physics underpinning Pop III star formation and demonstrate the effects of this uncertainty first on individual star formation histories and subsequently bracketing the range of global star formation levels we expect. Finally, we leverage this model to make preliminary observable predictions, generating forecasts for high-$z$ luminosity functions, transient rates, and the 21-cm global signal.

**Comment:** This paper presents a semi-analytic model for Population III star formation, focusing on the formation and evolution of the first stars in dark matter halos, including predictions for high-z luminosity functions and the 21-cm signal. While it deals with early galaxy formation and dark matter halos, its main focus is on cosmic dawn and reionization, not specifically on near-field cosmology or the properties of local dwarf galaxies or satellite systems.

## 5. [Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS): Satellite Quenching at Intermediate Redshift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20822) <a id="link5"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.20822

**Authors:** L. J. M. Davies, M. F. Fuentealba-Fuentes, R. J. Wright, M. Bravo, S. Wagh, M. Siudek

**Abstract:** Determining the processes by which galaxies transition from a star-forming to a quiescent state (quenching) is paramount to our understanding of galaxy evolution. One of the key mechanisms by which this takes place is via a galaxy's interactions with a local, over-dense environment (satellite or environmental quenching). In the very local Universe, we see these processes in action, and can also observe their effects via the distribution of satellite galaxy properties. However, extending similar analyses outside of the local Universe is problematic, largely due to the difficulties in robustly defining environments with small and/or incomplete spectroscopic samples. We use new environmental metrics from the high-completeness Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) to explore the properties of satellite galaxies at intermediate redshift (0.3$<$z$<$0.5) and compare directly to the Galaxy And Mass Assembly Survey (GAMA) at 0$<$z$<$0.2. Importantly, both the galaxy properties and environmental metrics in DEVILS and GAMA are derived in an identical manner, reducing any methodology biases. We find: i) that satellite galaxies in DEVILS and GAMA show suppressed star-formation in comparison to isolated systems at the same stellar mass, by $\sim$0.5dex in log$_{10}$(SFR/M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), ii) that this suppression is strongest in higher mass dark matter halos (up to $\sim$1dex in log$_{10}$(SFR/M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) in the most massive halos) and iii) that at fixed stellar and halo mass, this suppression increases with time - with satellite passive fractions increasing by $\sim$10-15\% over the last $\sim$5Gyr. This is consistent with previous observations and numerical simulations.

**Comment:** Focuses on satellite galaxies and their quenching in different environments, but at intermediate redshift (0.3<z<0.5) and compares to local Universe. While it discusses satellite galaxy properties and environmental effects, the emphasis is not specifically on the Milky Way or its immediate satellites, but rather on more general satellite populations in extragalactic surveys. Relevant to satellite galaxy evolution, but not tightly focused on near-field cosmology.

## 6. [Beyond Extreme Burstiness: Evolving Star Formation Efficiency as the Key to Early Galaxy Abundance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20606) <a id="link6"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.20606

**Authors:** Abhijnan Kar, Shadab Alam, Joseph Silk

**Abstract:** JWST observations have revealed an overabundance of bright galaxies at $z \geq 9$, creating apparent tensions with theoretical predictions within standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We address this challenge using a semi-empirical approach that connects dark matter halos to observed UV luminosity through physically motivated double power-law star formation efficiency (SFE) model as a function of halo mass, redshift and perform joint Bayesian analysis of luminosity functions spanning $z = 4 - 16$ using combined HST and JWST data. Through systematic model comparison using information criteria (AIC, BIC, DIC), we identify the optimal framework requiring redshift evolution only in the low-mass slope parameter $\alpha(z)$ while maintaining other SFE parameters constant. Our best-fitting model achieves excellent agreement with observations using modest, constant UV scatter $\sigma_{\rm UV} = 0.32$ dex, significantly lower than the $\gtrsim 1.3$ dex values suggested by previous studies for $z > 13$. This reduced scatter requirement is compensated by strongly evolving star formation efficiency, with $\alpha$ increasing toward higher redshifts, indicating enhanced star formation in low-mass halos during cosmic dawn. The model also successfully reproduces another important observational diagnostic such as effective galaxy bias across the full redshift range. Furthermore, model predictions are consistent up to a redshift of $z\sim 20$. Our results demonstrate that JWST's early galaxy observations can be reconciled with standard cosmology through the interplay of modest stochasticity and evolving star formation physics, without invoking extreme burstiness or exotic mechanisms.

**Comment:** This paper addresses the abundance of early galaxies at high redshift using star formation efficiency models and luminosity functions. While it deals with galaxy abundance and dark matter halos, its focus is on the high-redshift universe (z > 4) and not on near-field cosmology or local dwarf satellites. It is somewhat related through the study of low-mass halos, but not directly focused on the Milky Way or its satellites.

## 7. [A Comparative Study of Halo Mass Estimates from Group Catalogs and Lensing Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20294) <a id="link7"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.20294

**Authors:** Xinyue Chen, Weiwei Xu, Ran Li, Huanyuan Shan, Ji Yao, Chunxiang Wang

**Abstract:** We compare halo mass estimates from three galaxy group catalogs (redMaPPer, Yang21, and Zou21) with those derived from gravitational lensing measurements. Each catalog employs distinct methodologies, including mass-richness relations, abundance matching, and luminosity-based calibration. A linear correlation is observed between catalog-estimated and lensing-derived masses. The redMaPPer catalog shows the best agreement, especially for lower-redshift groups, with minor deviations in higher-redshift bins. Yang21 is the only catalog containing low mass groups, which gives a reasonably good mass estimation, except for the lowest mass bin. Cross-matched groups between redMaPPer and Yang21 reveal the former catalog provides more accurate mass estimation, while the Yang21 makes under-estimation of halo mass for those sharing the central galaxy with redMaPPer and over-estimation of halo mass for those with different center determination with redMaPPer and for the unique Yang21 groups. These findings emphasize the importance of redshift-dependent calibration and refined group definitions for accurate mass estimation.

**Comment:** This paper compares halo mass estimates from group catalogs and lensing, focusing on group catalogs that include low mass groups. While it touches on halo mass estimation and group finding, it does not specifically focus on dwarf satellite galaxies, satellite luminosity functions, or near-field cosmology. The focus is more on catalog methodology and mass calibration across a range of group masses, not specifically on the low-mass/dwarf regime or Milky Way satellites.

## 8. [PyBird-JAX: Accelerated inference in large-scale structure with model-independent emulation of one-loop galaxy power spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20990) <a id="link8"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.20990

**Authors:** Alexander Reeves, Pierre Zhang, Henry Zheng

**Abstract:** We present $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$, a differentiable, $\texttt{JAX}$-based implementation of $\texttt{PyBird}$, using internal neural network emulators to accelerate computationally costly operations for rapid large-scale structure (LSS) analysis. $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ computes one-loop EFTofLSS predictions for redshift-space galaxy power spectrum multipoles in 1.2 ms on a CPU and 0.2 ms on a GPU, achieving 3-4 orders of magnitude speed-up over $\texttt{PyBird}$. The emulators take a compact spline-based representation of the input linear power spectrum $P(k)$ as feature vectors, making the approach applicable to a wide range of cosmological models. We rigorously validate its accuracy against large-volume simulations and on BOSS data, including cosmologies not explicitly represented in the training set. Leveraging automatic differentiation, $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ supports Fisher forecasting, Taylor expansion of model predictions, gradient-based searches, and vectorised ensemble sampling. Interfaced with a variety of samplers and Boltzmann solvers, $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ provides a high-performance, end-to-end inference pipeline. Combined with a symbolic-$P(k)$ generator, a typical Stage-4 LSS MCMC converges in minutes on a GPU. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ delivers the precision and speed required for upcoming LSS surveys, opening the door to accelerated cosmological inference with minimal accuracy loss and no pretraining. In a companion paper [1], we put $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ to use in achieving LSS marginalised constraints free from volume projection effects through non-flat measures.

**Comment:** This paper focuses on accelerated inference for large-scale structure (LSS) analysis using galaxy power spectra, which is relevant to cosmological inference but does not specifically address near-field cosmology, satellite galaxies, or substructure. The focus is on methodology for LSS surveys rather than the small-scale structure or Milky Way satellites.

## 9. [Future Parameter Constraints from Weak Lensing CMB and Galaxy Lensing Power- and Bispectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20262) <a id="link9"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.20262

**Authors:** Jonas Frugte, P. Daniel Meerburg

**Abstract:** Upcoming stage 4 surveys, such as the Simons Observatory, LSST, and Euclid, are poised to measure weak gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and galaxies with unprecedented precision. While the power spectrum is the standard statistic used to analyze weak lensing data, non-Gaussianity from non-linear structure growth encodes additional cosmological information in higher-order statistics. We forecast the ability of future surveys to constrain cosmological parameters using the weak lensing power spectrum and bispectrum from both CMB and galaxy surveys, including their cross-correlations. We consider an eight-parameter model ($\Lambda$CDM + $\sum m_\nu$ + $w_0$) and assess constraints for stage 4 survey specifications. In the absence of systematics, both the CMB and galaxy lensing bispectra are found to be detectable at high signal-to-noise. We test two priors: a ''strong'' one based on constraints from CMB temperature and $E$-mode polarization anisotropies, and a ''weak'' one with minimal assumptions. With the weak prior, the bispectrum significantly improves parameter constraints by breaking degeneracies. For strong priors, improvements are more limited, especially for the CMB bispectrum. On small scales, where non-linear effects dominate, the bispectrum's constraining power can rival that of the power spectrum. We also find strong synergy between CMB and galaxy lensing; combining both probes leads to tighter constraints, particularly on neutrino mass. It was recently found that the CMB lensing bispectrum is strongly affected by the Born approximation, so we also consider post-Born corrections but find that our main conclusions remain the same. These results highlight the potential of higher-order lensing statistics and motivate further work on neglected effects such as non-Gaussian covariance, instrumental systematics, and baryonic feedback.

**Comment:** This paper forecasts cosmological parameter constraints from weak lensing of the CMB and galaxies, using power spectra and bispectra. While it is relevant to cosmological parameter estimation and large-scale structure, it does not focus on near-field cosmology, satellite galaxies, or substructure in the local universe.

## 10. [SPLENDOR: a novel detector platform to search for light dark matter with narrow-gap semiconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17782) <a id="link10"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.17782

**Authors:** P. Abbamonte, A. Albert, D. S. M. Alves, J. Anczarski, T. Aralis, T. U. B\"ohm, C. Boyd, J. Chen, P. -H. Chu, M. S. Cook, C. W. Fink, M. L. Graesser, Y. Kahn, C. S. Kengle, T. Kucinski, N. A. Kurinsky, C. Lane, A. Leder, R. Massarczyk, A. Mazumdar, S. J. Meijer, W. Nie, E. A. Peterson, A. Phipps, F. Ronning, P. F. S. Rosa, I. Rydstrom, N. S. Sirica, Z. J. Smith, K. Stifter, S. M. Thomas, S. L. Watkins, B. A. Young, J. -X. Zhu

**Abstract:** We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results. Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR provides a novel approach to dark matter detection, combining quantum sensing with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass range of dark matter parameter space.

**Comment:** This paper presents a novel detector platform for light dark matter searches using narrow-gap semiconductors. While dark matter detection is broadly relevant to cosmology, the work does not focus on near-field cosmology, satellite galaxies, or substructure in the local universe. The emphasis is on detector technology and dark matter parameter space.

## 11. [Linking enhanced star formation and quenching to faint tidal features in galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21050) <a id="link11"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.21050

**Authors:** Alexander J. Gordon, Annette M. N. Ferguson, Robert G. Mann, Vivienne Wild

**Abstract:** Galaxy mergers and interactions have long been suggested as a significant driver of galaxy evolution. However, the exact extent to which mergers enhance star formation and AGN activity has been challenging to establish observationally. In previous work, we visually classified a sample of galaxies with various types of faint tidal features in DECaLS images. In this paper, we cross-correlate this sample with a principal component analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey data to investigate how the presence of these features, as well as their specific nature, correlates with intense star formation and AGN activity. Averaged over all tidal classes, we find that tidal feature galaxies are 10.3$\pm$1.5 times more likely to be in a starburst phase, and 24.3$\pm$5.0 times more likely to have rapidly quenched (post-starbursts), than those in a mass-matched control sample. Examining differences between tidal classes, galaxies with \textit{arm} features are 1.4$\pm$0.2 times more likely to be starbursting than the other categories, while those with \textit{shell} features are 2.7$\pm$0.6 times more likely to be in a quiescent state. In a similar analysis, we identify which galaxies show evidence of AGN activity and find no significant difference between the fraction of those with or without tidal features. Overall, our results reinforce the notion that mergers play an important role in driving star formation and rapid quenching in galaxies, and provide some of the first empirical evidence that the strength of this effect has a dependence on the detailed nature of the interaction, as traced by the tidal feature morphology.

**Comment:** Examines the link between tidal features and star formation/quenching in galaxies, with a focus on mergers and interactions. While it touches on galaxy interactions and tidal features, it does not specifically address dwarf satellites, the Milky Way, or near-field cosmology topics.

## 12. [Fuzzy dark matter soliton as gravitational lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20323) <a id="link12"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.20323

**Authors:** Ke Wang

**Abstract:** The Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations predict fuzzy dark matter (FDM) solitons. Given the FDM mass $\sim10^{-20}\rm~{eV}/c^2$, the FDM soliton in the Milky Way is massive $\sim 10^7~M_{\odot}$ but diffuse $\sim 10{\rm~pc}$. Therefore, this FDM soliton can serve as a gravitational lens for gravitational waves (GWs) with frequency $\sim10^{-8}{\rm~Hz}$. In this paper, we investigate its gravitational lensing effects by numerical simulation of the propagation of GWs through it. We find that the maximum magnification factor of GWs is very small $\sim10^{-4}$, but the corresponding magnification zone is huge $\sim6{\rm~pc}$ for FDM with mass equal to $8^{-21}\rm~{eV}/c^2$. Consequently, this small magnification factor in that large magnification zone means a small antisotropy of $\sim10^{-4}$ over a large solid angle in the GW background, even though this antisotropy is out of the sensitivity of the pulsar timing arrays today.

**Comment:** Discusses fuzzy dark matter solitons in the Milky Way and their gravitational lensing effects. While it involves dark matter in the Milky Way, the focus is on soliton lensing of gravitational waves, not on satellite galaxies, substructure, or near-field cosmology topics.

## 13. [Dark photon dark matter from flattened axion potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20484) <a id="link13"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.20484

**Authors:** Hong-Yi Zhang, Paola Arias, Andrew Cheek, Enrico D. Schiappacasse, Luca Visinelli, Leszek Roszkowski

**Abstract:** Dark photons can be resonantly produced in the early universe via their coupling to an oscillating axion field. However, this mechanism typically requires large axion-dark photon couplings or some degree of fine-tuning. In this work, we present a new scenario in which efficient dark photon production arises from axion potentials that are shallower than quadratic at large field values. For moderately large initial misalignment angles, the oscillation of the axion field can trigger either efficient dark photon production or strong axion self-resonance via parametric resonance. When self-resonance dominates and disrupts the field's homogeneity, we show that oscillons -- localized, oscillating axion field configurations -- naturally form and can sustain continued dark photon production, provided the coupling is $\gtrsim \mathcal O(1)$. For dark photon mass up to three orders of magnitude below the axion mass, the produced dark photons can account for a significant fraction of the present-day dark matter. We support this scenario with numerical lattice simulations of a benchmark model. Our results further motivate experimental searches for ultralight dark photon dark matter. The simulation code is publicly available at https://github.com/hongyi18/AxionDarkPhotonSimulator.

**Comment:** This paper presents a new scenario for dark photon dark matter production via axion dynamics, including the formation of oscillons. While it is relevant to dark matter theory, it does not focus on near-field cosmology, satellite galaxies, or the core-cusp problem. The work is more about early universe physics and dark matter candidates, not the local universe or satellite galaxy properties.

## 14. [Superhorizon fluctuations and the cosmic dipole problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20462) <a id="link14"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.20462

**Authors:** Ge Chen, Chengcheng Han, Linwei Qiu

**Abstract:** Recent observations have identified a significant 4.9$\sigma$ tension between the cosmic dipole inferred from galaxy number counts and that derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), suggesting a potential deviation from the cosmological principle. This work investigates whether superhorizon isocurvature perturbations in cold dark matter (CDM) can account for this discrepancy. We demonstrate that, unlike adiabatic modes which cancel at leading order, superhorizon isocurvature modes can generate an intrinsic CMB dipole without significantly affecting galaxy number counts, thereby explaining the observed mismatch. We explore both single-mode and continuous-spectrum cases, focusing on two concrete models: a nearly scale-invariant power-law spectrum with a UV cutoff and axion-induced isocurvature perturbations. For the axion scenario, we show that if the radial mode evolves during inflation, the resulting perturbations can match the required amplitude while evading current CMB constraints. Our analysis constrains the self-coupling of associated potential for the axion to the range $10^{-9} < \lambda < 4 \times 10^{-9}$. These findings offer a viable solution to the dipole tension and may serve as indirect evidence for axion dark matter.

**Comment:** This paper investigates the cosmic dipole problem and superhorizon isocurvature perturbations, with a focus on cosmological principle and axion dark matter. While it discusses dark matter, it is not focused on near-field cosmology, satellite galaxies, or local group structure.

## 15. [Rotating Proto-Neutron Stars Admixed with Mirror Dark Matter: A two fluid approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20823) <a id="link15"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.20823

**Authors:** Adamu Issifu, Andreas Konstantinou, Prashant Thakur, Tobias Frederico

**Abstract:** This work investigates the impact of mirror dark matter (DM) on the global properties of rotating neutron stars (NSs) across evolutionary stages, from hot, lepton-rich proto-neutron stars (PNSs) to cold, catalyzed NSs along the Kelvin--Helmholtz timescale. The baryonic matter (BM) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field (RMF) approach with density-dependent couplings, while the dark sector mirrors the visible sector with analogous thermodynamic conditions. Using a two-fluid formalism with purely gravitational DM-BM interaction, we find that rotation enlarges the star, whereas DM admixture increases compactness and enhances gravitational stability. However, increased compactness due to DM lowers the threshold for rotational instabilities, making DM-admixed stars more susceptible. Rotation decreases temperature profiles by redistributing thermal energy over a larger volume and reducing central density, while DM raises temperatures by deepening the gravitational potential and increasing thermal energy. Stars become more prone to collapse and rotational instabilities as frequency ($\nu$) rises and the polar-to-equatorial radius ratio ($r_p/r_e$) decreases, especially near the Keplerian limit ($\nu_K$). DM-admixed stars also show higher surface gravitational redshifts due to their compactness. Our results qualitatively agree with universal relations primarily derived for rotating cold stars. These findings highlight competing effects of rotation and DM on NS thermal evolution, structure, and observables, potentially offering indirect probes of DM within NSs.

**Comment:** Focuses on the impact of dark matter (specifically mirror dark matter) on neutron star properties. While it involves dark matter, the context is neutron stars, not dwarf galaxies or satellite systems relevant to near-field cosmology. No direct connection to satellite luminosity functions, core-cusp, or substructure in the Milky Way or its satellites.

**Abstract:** Dark objects streaming into the solar system can be probed using gravitational wave (GW) experiments through the perturbations that they would induce on the detector test masses. In this work, we study the detectability of the resulting gravitational signal for a number of current and future GW observatories. Dark matter in the form of clumps or primordial black holes with masses in the range $10^7$-$10^{11}\,\rm{g}$ can be detected with the proposed DECIGO experiment.

## 17. [Bound dark energy: Particle origin of dark energy with DESI BAO and DES supernova data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19619) <a id="link17"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.19619

**Authors:** Jose Agustin Lozano Torres, Axel de la Macorra

**Abstract:** The recent findings from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicate a preference for dynamical dark energy at a significance level above $2.5 \sigma$, with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data, favoring a time dependent equation of state $w(z)$ rather than the cosmological constant ($w = -1$). We introduce the Bound Dark Energy (BDE) model, in which dark energy arises from the lightest meson field $\phi$ in a dark SU(3) gauge group, developing dynamically through non perturbative interactions. Governed by an inverse power law potential $V(\phi) = \Lambda_c^{4+2/3}\phi^{-2/3}$, BDE features no dark energy free parameters: one less than $\Lambda$CDM ($\Lambda$) and three less than the $ w_{0}w_{a} $CDM ($ w_{0}, w_{a},\Lambda $) models. By integrating DESI BAO measurements, CMB data and Dark Energy Survey SN Ia distance data collected during the fifth year, BDE demonstrates a reduction of $42$ and $37$ percent in the reduced $\chi^{2}_{BAO}$ as well as lower AIC and BIC values compared to the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM models, respectively, while maintaining a comparable fit for both type Ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background data. Although the ($w_{0},w_{a}$) contour in BDE is 10,000 times smaller than that found in the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model, the BDE model suggests a dynamical dark energy scenario with precise values of $w_{0}=$-0.9301 $\pm$ 0.0004 and $w_{a}=$ -0.8085 $\pm$ 0.0053 while providing a consistency on the six Planck and derived parameters at the 1$\sigma$ level between BDE, $\Lambda$CDM and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM models. The critical parameters condensation energy scale $\Lambda_{c} = 43.806 \pm 0.190$ eV and epoch $a_{c} = (2.497 \pm 0.011) \times 10^{-6}$ are consistent with predictions from high energy physics.

**Authors:** Mansur Ziiatdinov, Farida Farsian, Francesco Schillir\'o, Salvatore Distefano

**Abstract:** Machine Learning (ML) serves as a general-purpose, highly adaptable, and versatile framework for investigating complex systems across domains. However, the resulting computational resource demands, in terms of the number of parameters and the volume of data required to train ML models, can be high, often prohibitive. This is the case in astrophysics, where multimedia space data streams usually have to be analyzed. In this context, quantum computing emerges as a compelling and promising alternative, offering the potential to address these challenges in a feasible way. Specifically, a four-step quantum machine learning (QML) workflow is proposed encompassing data encoding, quantum circuit design, model training and evaluation. Then, focusing on the data encoding step, different techniques and models are investigated within a case study centered on the Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) signal detection in the astrophysics domain. The results thus obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of QML in astrophysics, highlighting the critical role of data encoding, which significantly affects the QML model performance.

**Comment:** This paper compares quantum machine learning approaches for astrophysical signal detection, specifically focusing on gamma-ray bursts. It does not address near-field cosmology, satellite galaxies, or substructure, and is more about computational methods in astrophysics.

## 19. [Debiasing inference in large-scale structure with non-flat volume measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20991) <a id="link19"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.20991

**Authors:** Alexander Reeves, Pierre Zhang, Henry Zheng

**Abstract:** Increasingly large parameter spaces, used to more accurately model precision observables in physics, can paradoxically lead to large deviations in the inferred parameters of interest -- a bias known as volume projection effects -- when marginalising over many nuisance parameters. For posterior distributions that admit a Laplace expansion, we show that this artefact of Bayesian inference can be mitigated by defining expectation values with respect to a non-flat volume measure, such that the posterior mean becomes unbiased on average. We begin by finding a measure that ensures the mean is an unbiased estimator of the mode. Although the mode itself, as we rediscover, is biased under sample averaging, this choice yields the least biased estimator due to a cancellation we clarify. We further explain why bias in marginal posteriors can appear relatively large, yet remains correctable, when the number of nuisances is large. To demonstrate our approach, we present mock analyses in large-scale structure (LSS) wherein cosmological parameters are subject to large projection effects (at the 1-2$\sigma$ level) under a flat measure, that are however recovered at high fidelity ($<0.1\sigma$) when estimated using non-flat counterparts. Our cosmological analyses are enabled by $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$, a fast, differentiable pipeline for LSS developed in our companion paper [1].

**Comment:** This paper addresses statistical inference in large-scale structure cosmology, focusing on debiasing parameter estimation in the presence of many nuisance parameters. It does not address near-field cosmology, satellite galaxies, or related substructure topics.

## 20. [Fast and "lossless" propagation of relativistic electrons along magnetized non-thermal filaments in galaxy clusters and the Galactic Center region](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20780) <a id="link20"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.20780

**Authors:** Eugene Churazov, Lawrence Rudnick, Ildar Khabibullin, Marisa Brienza, Alex Schekochihin, Dmitri Uzdensky

**Abstract:** Relativistic leptons in galaxy clusters lose their energy via radiation (synchrotron and inverse Compton losses) and interactions with the ambient plasma. At z~0, pure radiative losses limit the lifetime of electrons emitting at ~GHz frequencies to t<100 Myr. Adiabatic losses can further lower Lorentz factors of electrons trapped in an expanding medium. If the propagation speed of electrons relative to the ambient weakly magnetized (plasma $\beta\sim10^2$) Intracluster Medium (ICM) is limited by the Alfv\'en speed, $v_{a,ICM}=c_{s,ICM}/\beta^{1/2}\sim 10^7\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, GHz-emitting electrons can travel only $l \sim v_{a,ICM}t_r\sim 10\,kpc$ relative to the underlying plasma. Yet, elongated structures spanning hundreds of kpc or even a few Mpc are observed, requiring either a re-acceleration mechanism or another form of synchronization, e.g., by a large-scale shock. We argue that filaments with ordered magnetic fields supported by non-thermal pressure have $v_{a}\gg v_{a,{\rm ICM}}$ and so can provide such a synchronization even without re-acceleration or shocks. In particular, along quasi-stationary filaments, electrons can propagate without experiencing adiabatic losses, and their velocity is not limited by the Alfv\'en or sound speeds of the ambient thermal plasma. This model predicts that along filaments that span significant pressure gradients, e.g., in the cores of galaxy clusters, the synchrotron break frequency $\nu_b\propto B$ should scale with the ambient gas pressure as $P^{1/2}$, and the emission from such filaments should be strongly polarized. While some of these structures can be observed as "filaments", i.e., long and narrow bright structures, others can be unresolved and have a collective appearance of a diffuse structure, or be too faint to be detected, while still providing channels for electrons' propagation.

**Comment:** Discusses relativistic electron propagation in filaments in galaxy clusters and the Galactic Center region. The focus is on plasma physics and cosmic ray transport, not on satellite galaxies, substructure, or near-field cosmology.

## 21. [From South to North: Leveraging Ground-Based LATs for Full-Sky CMB Delensing and Constraints on $r$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19897) <a id="link21"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.19897

**Authors:** Wen-Zheng Chen, Yang Liu, Yi-Ming Wang, Hong Li

**Abstract:** Delensing--the process of mitigating the lensing-induced B-mode contamination in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations--will be a pivotal challenge for next-generation CMB experiments seeking to detect primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) through B-mode polarization. This process requires an accurate lensing tracer, which can be obtained either through internal reconstruction from high-resolution CMB observations or from external large-scale structure (LSS) surveys. Ground-based large-aperture telescopes (LATs) are crucial for internal reconstruction, yet existing and planned facilities are confined to the southern hemisphere, limiting effective delensing to that region. In this work, we assess the impact of introducing a northern hemisphere LAT, assumed to be situated near AliCPT (hence termed Ali-like LAT, or LATN), on delensing performance and PGW detection, using simulations. Our baseline setup includes a space-based small-aperture mission (LiteBIRD-like, SAT) and a southern LAT (SO-like, LATS). External LSS tracers, which have been shown to play an important role in delensing before the availability of ultra-sensitive polarization data, are also considered. We find that southern-hemisphere internal delensing reduces the uncertainty in r by approximately 21% compared to the no-delensing case. Adding LATN enables full-sky internal delensing, achieving a further ~19% reduction--comparable to that from including LSS tracers (~17%). Once LATN is included, the marginal benefit of LSS tracers drops to ~10%. These results highlight the significant role of LATN in advancing delensing capabilities and improving PGW constraints.

**Comment:** This paper discusses CMB delensing strategies and the impact of ground-based telescopes on primordial gravitational wave constraints. It does not address near-field cosmology, satellite galaxies, or dark matter substructure.

**Abstract:** We present an overview of the MINERVA survey, a 259.8 hour (prime) and 127 hour (parallel) Cycle 4 treasury program on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). MINERVA is obtaining 8 filter NIRCam medium band imaging (F140M, F162M, F182M, F210M, F250M, F300M, F360M, F460M) and 2 filter MIRI imaging (F1280W, F1500W) in four of the five CANDELS Extragalactic fields: UDS, COSMOS, AEGIS and GOODS-N. These fields were previously observed in Cycle 1 with 7 - 9 NIRCam filters by the PRIMER, CEERS and JADES programs. MINERVA reaches a 5$\sigma$ depth of 28.1 mag in F300M and covers $\sim$ 542 arcmin$^2$, increasing the area of existing JWST medium-band coverage in at least 8 bands by $\sim$ 7$\times$. The MIRI imaging reaches a 5$\sigma$ depth of 23.9 mag in F1280W and covers $\sim$ 275 arcmin$^2$ in at least 2 MIRI filters. When combined with existing imaging, these data will provide a photometric catalog with 20-26 JWST filters (depending on field) and 26-35 filters total, including HST. This paper presents a detailed breakdown of the filter coverage, exposure times, and field layout relative to previous observations, as well as an overview of the primary science goals of the project. These include uncovering the physics of enigmatic sources hiding in current broadband catalogs, improving systematics on stellar mass functions and number densities by factors of $\gtrsim$ 3, and resolved mapping of stellar mass and star formation at 1 $< z <$ 6. When complete, MINERVA will become an integral part of the treasury deep field imaging datasets, significantly improving population studies with well-understood completeness, robust photometric redshifts, stellar masses, and sizes, and facilitating spectroscopic follow up for decades to come.

**Comment:** This is a survey description paper for JWST imaging of extragalactic fields, focusing on deep field observations and galaxy evolution at 1 < z < 6. It does not focus on near-field cosmology, satellite galaxies, or local group dwarfs, and is thus not relevant.

## 23. [The phase spiral's origin and evolution: indications from its varying properties across the Milky Way disk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19579) <a id="link23"></a>

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.19579

**Authors:** Axel Widmark, Kiyan Tavangar, Josh Kalish, Kathryn V. Johnston, Jason A. S. Hunt

**Abstract:** The phase spiral is a perturbation to the vertical phase-space distribution of stars in the Milky Way disk. We study the phase spiral's properties and how they vary with spatial position, in order to constrain its origin and evolution, as well as properties of the disk itself. We produce high resolution maps using two complementary data processing schemes: (a) we bin the Gaia proper motion sample in a disk parallel spatial grid, reaching distances up to 4 kpc; (b) we bin the spatially nearby line-of-sight velocity sample in terms of disk parallel orbital parameters. We find complex structure, most significantly with respect to Galactocentric radius and guiding radius, but also in Galactic azimuth and epicyclic action and phase. We find that spiral winding and rotation phase vary smoothly across the disk, with close-to-flat radial profiles. This uniform structure, in particular for the rotation phase, indicates that the phase spiral was sourced by one or many global perturbations. Curiously, this also implies that the winding time has a strong slope with respect to Galactocentric radius, with low values for the inner disk.

**Comment:** The paper studies the phase spiral in the Milky Way disk, focusing on vertical phase-space perturbations and their spatial variation. This is primarily about the structure and dynamics of the Milky Way disk, not about dwarf satellites, satellite luminosity functions, or near-field cosmology. The focus is on disk properties, which is explicitly listed as irrelevant.

**Abstract:** In this work, we present LensingFlow. This is an implementation of an automated workflow to search for evidence of gravitational lensing in a large series of gravitational wave events. This workflow conducts searches for evidence in all generally considered lensing regimes. The implementation of this workflow is built atop the Asimov automation framework and CBCFlow metadata management software and the resulting product therefore encompasses both the automated running and status checking of jobs in the workflow as well as the automated production and storage of relevant metadata from these jobs to allow for later reproduction. This workflow encompasses a number of existing lensing pipelines and has been designed to accommodate any additional future pipelines to provide both a current and future basis on which to conduct large scale lensing analyses of gravitational wave signal catalogues. The workflow also implements a prioritisation management system for jobs submitted to the schedulers in common usage in computing clusters ensuring both the completion of the workflow across the entire catalogue of events as well as the priority completion of the most significant candidates. As a first proof-of-concept demonstration, we deploy LensingFlow on a mock data challenge comprising 10 signals in which signatures of each lensing regime are represented. LensingFlow successfully ran and identified the candidates from this data through its automated checks of results from consituent analyses.

**Comment:** This paper introduces an automated workflow for gravitational wave lensing analyses. It is not related to near-field cosmology, satellite galaxies, or dark matter substructure.

We first identified it as an ultra metal-poor (UMP; $\\rm[Fe/H] < -4$) red giant-branch (RGB) star candidate in the $Gaia$ BP/RP (XP) spectro-photometric catalog ($Gaia$ $G$ magnitude $\\approx$15). A combination of multi-band photometry and high-resolution spectroscopic analysis under local thermodynamic equilibrium confirmed the status of GDR3_526285 as a distant ($\\approx$24 kpc from the Sun) RGB star ($T_{\\rm eff} = 4596\\,{\\rm K}$, $\\log g = 0.88$) in the Milky Way's outer halo. We obtain only an upper limit for the carbon abundance of $\\rm[C/H] < -4.32$, resulting in $\\rm[C/Fe] < +0.50$. A correction for the evolutionary carbon depletion ($\\Delta \\rm[C/Fe] = +0.68$) brings the nominal carbon-to-iron ratio upper limit to $\\rm[C/Fe]_{\\rm cor} < +1.18$. Given its extraordinarily low [C/H], GDR3_526285 likely formed from gas cooled via dust grains rather than fine structure line cooling. The kinematics of GDR3_526285 suggests that this star was either dynamically perturbed by the infall of the Magellanic system or was formerly a member of the Magellanic Clouds and was later stripped by the Milky Way. Our results showcase the potential of an all-sky search for low-metallicity targets with $Gaia$ XP and confirm that the methodology described here is an useful \"treasure map\" for finding additional UMP stars.",

        "abstract": "The Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy is undoubtedly being disrupted in the tidal field of the Milky Way. The Milky Way disc is also found to be in a state of disequilibrium. The role of the Sagittarius in driving or contributing to this disequilibrium has been extensively investigated. Most of these studies, however, assume an initially near-equilibrium disc. It was also hypothesized that the passage of Sagittarius could have increased the star-forming activity in the Solar Neighbourhood. We check whether galaxies that have undergone cosmological evolution are affected by interactions analogous to those between the Sagittarius and the Milky Way. We use the high-resolution simulation TNG50 to look for pairs similar to the Milky Way and Sagittarius. We search within redshift z=1-0 for discs from the MW/M31 sample that interacted with a satellite more massive than 10 billion Msun, had a pericenter smaller than 50 kpc, and was on an approximately polar orbit. We exclude cases where, within 1 Gyr of the pericenter, a similar interaction occurred. In 90 percent of cases, a passage of the Sagittarius analogue had no significant effect on either the vertical velocity field of the disc or the star formation history. A response in vertical stellar kinematics can be found mostly in cold discs and mildly correlates with the strength of interactions. For star formation, the studied interactions had an effect only when little to no star formation was ongoing prior to the interaction, often due to previously disturbed star-forming discs, e.g., from AGN activity. Our results indicate that stellar discs in TNG50 are frequently vertically perturbed preceding pericenter passages of Sagittarius analogues. Future studies using other simulations and extragalactic surveys will help establish whether vertical disequilibrium is a common feature of disc galaxies or an artifact of the specific setup studied.",

While one star shows binary mass transfer signatures, the other six display consistent abundance patterns (dispersions $<$ uncertainties).

We find that the transformer-based network significantly outperforms the CNN across all metrics, achieving sub-percent error in the total segmented mass per halo class. Both networks deliver much higher accuracy than the perturbation-theory-based model \\textsc{pinocchio}, especially at low halo masses and in the detailed reconstruction of proto-halo boundaries. We also investigate the impact of different input features by training models on the density field, the tidal shear, and their combination.

        "abstract": "The magnitude gap between the central and satellite galaxies encodes information about the mass accretion history of a dark matter halo, and serves as a useful observational probe for the mass distribution in a halo. In this work, we perform the first weak lensing test of the connections between the magnitude gap and the halo profile. We measure the halo profiles of isolated central galaxies (ICGs) selected primarily from the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample. Halo mass and concentration are inferred by fitting stacked lensing profiles in bins of central luminosity, $L_\\mathrm{c}$, and the central-satellite magnitude gap, $L_\\mathrm{gap}$. We detect dependence on the magnitude gap in both halo properties. The dependence is the strongest in the ICG luminosity range of $10^{10.3}<L_\\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\\odot] \\leq 10^{10.3}$, a disordering of the gap dependence is marginally observable. We compare the observational results with predictions by two lightcone catalogs built from the Illustris TNG300 and the Millennium simulations. The gap dependence in the two mock samples show overall consistency with observations, but neither matches them in all $L_\\mathrm{c}$ bins to a quantitative level. We also compare the significance of the gap dependence on halo mass and concentration and find that our measurement prefers gap dependence in both parameters, while the halo mass dependence is preferred over the concentration if only one of the two dependencies is allowed.",

Identifying their origins is crucial for revealing galaxy properties at early times. Traditional classification methods relying on dynamical properties face inherent uncertainties stemming from the evolving Galactic potential and complex merger histories. Chemically driven classification confronts a distinct obstacle: multiple populations - abundance variations in light elements of GC members. In this Letter, we identify primordial populations exhibiting lower [Al/Fe] as reliable tracers of their birth environments' chemical evolution. A clear chemical dichotomy emerges between in-situ and accreted GC populations at [Fe/H] > -1.5, particularly in the [Mg/Fe]-[Al/Fe] plane, indicating that their progenitor galaxies have experienced fundamentally different enrichment histories. While our chemically driven classification demonstrates general consistency with dynamically driven classifications, notable discrepancies emerge: NGC 288 and M4 are reclassified as in-situ, and Terzan 9 as accreted. This chemically driven GC classification provides promising application for Galactic archaeology.",

        "abstract": "With over two dozen detections in the Milky Way, double neutron stars (DNSs) provide a unique window into massive binary evolution. We use the POSYDON binary population synthesis code to model DNS populations and compare them to the observed Galactic sample. By tracing their origins to underlying single and binary star physics, we place constraints on the detailed evolutionary stages leading to DNS formation. Our study reveals a bifurcation within the well-known common envelope formation channel for DNSs, which naturally explains an observed split in the orbital periods of the Galactic systems. The two sub-channels are defined by whether the donor star has a helium core (Case B mass transfer) or a carbon-oxygen core (Case C) at the onset of the common envelope, with only the helium core systems eventually merging due to gravitational wave-modulated orbital decay. However, producing DNSs through both sub-channels requires either a generous core definition of $\\simeq$ 30% H-fraction or a high common envelope ejection efficiency of $\\alpha_{\\rm CE}\\gtrsim1.2$. By testing different supernova kick velocity models, we find that galactic DNSs are best reproduced using a prescription that favors low velocity kicks ($\\lesssim 50 \\, \\rm km/s$), in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, our models indicate that merging DNSs are born from a stripped progenitor with a median pre-supernova envelope mass $\\sim$ 0.2$M_{\\odot}$.

By combining these data with archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, we derived proper motions (PMs) for a significant portion of the JWST field. Our analysis of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) reveals two prominent sequences extending from a magnitude F322W2 ~ 17.5 to the bottom of the main sequence (MS). These sequences correspond to the two main stellar populations of omega Centauri: the bMS (He-rich) and rMS (He-normal) populations. The two sequences intersect at the MS knee (F322W2 ~ 19.5) and change positions for lower magnitudes, with the bMS luminosity function (LF) ending at least ~0.5 magnitudes brighter than the rMS LF. We identified a third group of stars (named gMS) along the main sequence located between the two primary ones and conducted a detailed analysis of the LFs and MFs for these three stellar populations. The LFs of these sequences show similar trends, with the rMS being the most populated and the bMS the least. The MFs display distinct power-law slopes: the rMS is well fitted by a single power-law while the gMS and the bMS are characterised by MFs steeper than that of the rMS for masses larger than 0.2 solar masses and flatter MFs for smaller masses. The flattening around ~0.2 solar masses for the gMS and the bMS might be a real feature of the MFs of these populations or due to uncertainties in the adopted mass-luminosity relationship (MLR). The variation in the slope of the MFs of the gMS and bMS contributes to the steepening (flattening) of the combined MF for masses higher (lower) than 0.2 solar masses.",

Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs ($m_{\\rm BH} \\sim 10^6 M_\\odot$) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation, and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion. Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H$2$ cooling, shifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with significant baryon--dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\\rm b\\chi} \\gtrsim 0.8 \\sigma_{\\rm b\\chi}$, where $\\sigma_{\\rm b\\chi}$ is the root-mean-square streaming velocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense, gravitationally unstable, atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH wake.

        "abstract": "The substellar initial mass function (IMF) and the formation mechanisms of brown dwarfs (BDs) remain key open questions in star formation theory. IMF characterization in a large number of star-forming regions (SFRs) is essential for constraining these processes. We aim to identify and spectroscopically confirm very low-mass members of the Corona Australis (CrA) SFR to refine its substellar census, determine its low-mass IMF, and compare it to other clusters. Using deep I-band photometry from SuprimeCam/Subaru and data from the VISTA Hemisphere Survey, we identified low-mass BD candidates in CrA. We subsequently obtained NIR spectra of 173 of these candidates with KMOS/VLT, as well as optical spectra for 8 kinematic candidate members using FLOYDS/LCO. The kinematic candidates are confirmed as low-mass stellar members with spectral types M1 to M5. In contrast, all 173 BD candidates observed with KMOS are identified as contaminants. Although the follow-up yielded no new substellar members, it places strong constraints on the number of undetected substellar objects in the region. Combined with literature data, this enables us to derive the substellar IMF, which is consistent with a single power-law slope of alpha = 0.95+-0.06 in the range 0.01-1 MSun or alpha = 0.33+-0.19 in the range 0.01-0.1 MSun. The star-to-BD ratio in CrA is about 2. We also provide updated IMFs and star-to-BD ratios for Lupus3 and ChaI from the SONYC survey, reflecting revised distances from Gaia. Finally, we estimate surface densities and median FUV fluxes for 6 SFRs and clusters and compare their substellar populations as a function of environmental properties. The IMF and star-to-BD ratio show no clear dependence on stellar density or ionizing flux from the massive stars. A combined effect - where one factor enhances and the other suppresses BD formation - also appears unlikely. (Abridged)",

        "abstract": "Estimating properties of star clusters from unresolved broadband photometry is a challenging problem that is classically tackled by spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting methods that are based on simple stellar population (SSP) models. However, because of their exponential scaling, grid-based methods suffer from computational limitations. In addition, stochastic latent variables in the model can make the computation of the likelihood function intractable. These limitations can be overcome by modern generative deep learning methods that offer flexible and powerful tools for modeling high-dimensional posterior distributions and fast inference from learned data. We present a normalizing flow approach for the inference of cluster age, mass, and reddening from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) broadband photometry. In particular, we explore our network's behavior on an inference problem that has been analyzed in previous works. We used the SED modeling code CIGALE to create a dataset of synthetic photometric observations for $5 \\times 10^6$ mock star clusters. Subsequently, this data set was used to train a coupling-based flow in the form of a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) to predict posterior probability distributions for cluster age, mass, and reddening from photometric observations. We predicted cluster parameters for the 'Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS' (PHANGS) Data Release 3 catalog. To evaluate the capabilities of the network, we compared our results to the publicly available PHANGS estimates and found that the estimates agree reasonably well. We demonstrate that normalizing flow methods can be a viable tool for the inference of cluster parameters, and argue that this approach is especially useful when latent variables make the computation of the likelihood intractable and in scenarios that require efficient density estimation.",

We present spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of Cassiopeia A's (Cas A) northeastern (NE) jet using the archival 1 Ms Chandra/ACIS observations, and focusing on three fingers of the jet. We report the highest Cr/Fe mass ratio (Cr/Fe $\\sim0.14$) ever observed in Cas A, localized in a compact region within the southernmost finger in the NE jet. Comparisons with nucleosynthesis models indicate that the NE jet originated approximately at the boundary separating the complete Si burning layer from the incomplete Si-burning layer. We also find that mixing from different layers is needed to explain the chemical composition of the three fingers in the NE jet. We also detect significant differences in the physical and chemical properties among the three fingers analyzed of the NE jet. In particular, we find that, unlike the other two, the southernmost finger originated from a slightly more peripheral region of the explosion. Moreover, while the northern and central fingers lie almost in the plane of the sky, the southernmost finger is moving in a different direction, showing a velocity along the line of sight of $\\sim2100$ km s$^{-1}$ towards the observer, with a tilt angle of $\\sim16$\\textdegree.

We map the outflows into the FLASH hydrodynamics code to model their expansion in axisymmetry, and study the effects of employing different $r$-process heating rates. Except for the highest heating rate prescription, we find no significant differences with respect to overall ejecta dynamics and morphology compared to the simulation without heating. Once homologous expansion is attained, typically after $\\sim$ 2s for these ejecta, we map the outflows to the Sedona radiative transfer code and compute the spectral evolution of the kilonova and broadband light curves in various LSST bands. The kilonova properties depend on the remnant lifetime, with peak luminosities and peak timescales increasing for longer-lived remnants that produce more massive ejecta. For all models, there is a strong dependence of both the bolometric and broadband light curves on the viewing angle. While the short-lived (12ms) remnant produces higher luminosities when viewed from angles closer to the pole, longer-lived remnants (240ms and 2.5s) are more luminous when viewed from angles closer to the equator. Our results highlight the importance of self-consistent, long-term modeling of merger ejecta, and taking viewing-angle dependence into account when interpreting observed kilonova light curves. We find that magnetized outflows from a HMNS -- if it survives long enough -- could explain blue kilonovae, such as the blue emission seen in AT2017gfo.",

Since LRDs may be in the early phase of black hole growth, identifying them in the early universe is crucial for understanding the formation of the first supermassive black holes. However, no robust LRD candidates have been identified at $z>10$, because commonly-used NIRCam photometry covers wavelengths up to $\\sim5\\,{\\rm \\mu m}$ and is insufficient to capture the characteristic V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of LRDs.

CW-LRD-z10 exhibits a compact morphology, a distinct V-shaped SED, and a non-detection in F115W, all consistent with being an LRD at $z\\sim10$.

In this paper, we show that Ganymede, the largest Jovian moon, provides a prime target to search for dark matter impacts due to its differentiated composition and Gyr-old surface. We study the effects of dark matter collisions with Ganymede first with analytic estimates, finding that in a large region of parameter space, dark matter punches through Ganymede's conductive ice sheet, liberating sub-surface material. This sub-surface material may be compositionally different from the surface ice, providing a key observable with which to discriminate asteroid impacts from those caused by dark matter. We confirm our analytic estimates with dedicated simulations of dark matter impacts using iSALE, a multi-material impact code. We then discuss potential detection prospects with two missions currently en route to the Jovian system, Europa Clipper and JUICE, finding that these missions may have the ability not only to identify signs of life on the Galilean moons, but signs of dark matter as well.",

Given that more massive giants retain more surface lithium, increasing mass by accreting circumstellar matter could be a channel to enrich lithium. We evaluate this process in the current work. Using MESA, we construct a model of matter accretion, including mass loss, that evolves a star from the main sequence turnoff to the red giant branch tip. The mean accretion rate is estimated from the upper limit of the accreted mass and the evolutionary time of the star during this period, and a grid of accretion rates is constructed. We separately consider their effects on the lithium enhancement of giants, both in terms of the mass and the composition of accretion. Accreting matter with higher lithium abundances has a promoting effect on the lithium enhancement of giants. The accreted matter with excess lithium alleviates the dilution of lithium in the convective envelope during the first dredge-up. The added mass results in lower temperatures at the bottom of the convective envelope, which likewise weakens the depletion of surface lithium. Weak accretion of circumstellar matter is a possible route to lithium enhancement for giants, and it predicts an upper limit on the lithium abundance of $\\rm \\sim 2.5\\,dex$. However, the mass increment it requires poses a potential challenge to real astrophysical environments. Such accretion suppresses lithium dilution and depletion of the star during the first dredge-up, thus exhibiting lithium enhancement behavior.",

Crucially, our limits exclude the projected sensitivity regions of current and upcoming direct detection experiments. Since these conclusions are a priori not valid for light mediators, we extend our analysis to this case.

        "abstract": "The progenitors of Type II-P supernovae (SNe) are generally considered to be red supergiants; however, the so-called \"red supergiant problem\" indicates that a deeper investigation into the progenitors of this class of SNe is necessary. SN 2009ib and SN 2012ec are two Type II-P SNe for which progenitor candidates have been identified in pre-explosion images. In this work, we use new, late-time Hubble Space Telescope observations to search for the disappearance of these two candidates and confirm their nature. In the case of SN 2009ib, the late-time high-resolution imaging reveals that the progenitor candidate is in fact a blend of multiple unresolved stars. Subsequent difference imaging shows no significant change in brightness at the SN's position even years after the explosion. These findings indicate that the flux from the previously identified source is dominated by unresolved field stars, with little to no contribution from the genuine progenitor. In the case of SN 2012ec, a comparison of pre-explosion and late-time images reveals that the progenitor candidate faded by about 0.6 mag in the F814W band seven years after the explosion, confirming the disappearance of the progenitor.",

        "abstract": "We present a catalog of 8545 and 19,257 unique DA white dwarfs observed in SDSS Data Release 19 and previous SDSS data releases, respectively. This is the largest catalog of both spectroscopic and photometric measurements of DA white dwarfs available to date, and we make this catalog and all code used to create it publicly available. We measure the apparent radial velocity, spectroscopic effective temperature and surface gravity, and photometric effective temperature and radius for all objects in our catalog. We validate our measurements against other published white dwarf catalogs. For apparent radial velocities, surface gravities, and effective temperatures measured from spectra with signal-to-noise ratios $>50$, our measurements agree with published SDSS white dwarf catalogs to within 7.5 km/s, 0.060 dex, and $2.4\\%$, respectively. For radii and effective temperatures measured with Gaia photometry, our measurements agree with other published Gaia datasets to within $0.0005$ $R_\\odot$ and $3\\%$, respectively. We use this catalog to investigate systematic discrepancies between white dwarfs observed in SDSS-V and previous generations of SDSS. For objects observed in both SDSS-V and previous generations, we uncover systematic differences between measured spectroscopic parameters depending on which set of survey data is used. On average, the measured apparent radial velocity of a DA white dwarf is $11.5$ km/s larger and the surface gravity is $0.015$ dex smaller when a white dwarf's spectroscopic parameters are measured using SDSS-V data compared to using data from previous generations of SDSS. These differences may be due to changes in the wavelength solution across survey generations.",

This can be implemented recursively in powers of the velocity in both the Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks. We validate our analytic calculations against fully nonlinear N-body simulations, demonstrating that they can be used to recover the growth rate at better than percent level precision, well beyond the statistical requirements of upcoming peculiar velocity surveys and measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect.

Detecting eccentricity in these systems is challenging due to a lack of accurate eccentric waveform models and the high computational cost of Bayesian inferences. We access the eccentricities of six previously observed low-mass gravitational wave events using publicly available data from the first four observing runs of the LIGO and Virgo collaboration. We analyze the events using the new eccentric waveform model, SEOBNRv5EHM, and compare our results with the existing model, TEOBResumS-Dali. We also present the first eccentricity constraints for GW190814. To improve accuracy, we include higher-order modes in both models and optimize inference using efficient marginalization and parallelization techniques. We find that GW200105 exhibits non-negligible eccentricity, with a measured eccentricity of $e=0.135^{+0.019}_{-0.088}$ at 20 Hz (90% credible level) for TEOBResumS-Dali and $e=0.125^{+0.029}_{-0.082}$ for SEOBNRv5EHM, given a uniform eccentricity prior from 0 to 0.2. This provides moderate support for the eccentric hypothesis, with a Bayes factor of $\\sim10-15$ in favor of the eccentric model. With a uniform log prior on eccentricity, the Bayes factor is reduced to 2.35. The remaining five sources are consistent with low eccentricity, with 90% upper limits from $e \\leq 0.011$ to $e \\leq 0.066$. We find no support for non-negligible eccentricity in GW190814.",

We present results of such a joint search with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) for the optical counterpart of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA event S250328ae, a binary black hole merger candidate of high significance detected at a distance of 511$\\pm$82 Mpc and localized within an area of 3 (15) square degrees at 50% (90%) confidence. We observed the 90% confidence area with DECam and identified 36 high-confidence transient candidates after image processing, candidate selection, and candidate vetting. We observed with PFS to obtain optical spectra of DECam candidates, Swift-XRT candidates, and potential host galaxies of S250328ae. In total, 3897 targets were observed by seven pointings covering ~50% of the 90% confidence area. After template fitting and visual inspection, we identified 12 SNe, 159 QSOs, 2975 galaxies, and 131 stars. With the joint observations of DECam and PFS, we found variability in 12 SNe, 139 QSOs, 37 galaxies, and 2 stars. We do not identify any confident optical counterparts, though the association is not ruled out for three variable candidates that are not observed by PFS and 6 QSO candidates without clear variability if the optical counterpart of S250328ae is faint. Despite the lack of confident optical counterparts, this paper serves as a framework for future collaborations between wide-field imagers and multi-object spectrographs to maximize multi-messenger analyses.",

        "abstract": "The 21 cm radiation of neutral hydrogen provides crucial information for studying the early universe and its evolution. To advance this research, countries have made significant investments in constructing large low-frequency radio telescope arrays, such as the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Square Kilometre Array Phase 1 Low Frequency (SKA1-low). These instruments are pivotal for radio astronomy research. However, challenges such as ionospheric plasma interference, ambient radio noise, and instrument-related effects have become increasingly prominent, posing major obstacles in cosmology research. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient signal processing method that combines wavelet transform and mathematical morphology. The method involves the following steps: Background Subtraction: Background interference in radio observation signals is eliminated. Wavelet Transform: The signal, after removing background noise, undergoes a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform. Threshold processing is then applied to the wavelet coefficients to effectively remove interference components. Wavelet Inversion: The processed signal is reconstructed using wavelet inversion. Mathematical Morphology: The reconstructed signal is further optimized using mathematical morphology to refine the results. Experimental verification was conducted using solar observation data from the Xinjiang Observatory and the Yunnan Observatory. The results demonstrate that this method successfully removes interference signals while preserving useful signals, thus improving the accuracy of radio astronomy observations and reducing the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI).",

        "abstract": "Soft X-ray emission from neutron stars affords powerful diagnostic tools for uncovering their surface and interior properties, as well as their geometric configurations. In the atmospheres of neutron stars, the presence of magnetic fields alters the photon-electron scattering cross sections, resulting in non-trivial angular dependence of intensity and polarization of the emergent signals. This paper presents recent developments of our Monte Carlo simulation, MAGTHOMSCATT, which tracks the complex electric field vector for each photon during its transport. Our analysis encompasses the anisotropy and polarization characteristics of X-ray emission for field strengths ranging from non-magnetic to extremely magnetized regimes that are germane to magnetars. In the very low field domain, we reproduced the numerical solution to the radiative transfer equation for non-magnetic Thomson scattering, and provided analytical fits for the angular dependence of the intensity and the polarization degree. These fits can be useful for studies of millisecond pulsars and magnetic white dwarfs. By implementing a refined injection protocol, we show that, in the magnetar regime, the simulated intensity and polarization pulse profiles of emission from extended surface regions becomes invariant with respect to the ratio of photon ($\\omega$) and electron cyclotron ($\\omega_{\\rm B}$) frequencies once $\\omega / \\omega_{\\rm B} \\lesssim 0.01$. This circumvents the need for simulations pertinent to really high magnetic field strengths, which are inherently slower.

        "abstract": "We investigate how dust foreground complexity can affect measurements of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, in the context of the Simons Observatory, using a cross-spectrum component separation analysis. Employing a suite of simulations with realistic Galactic dust emission, we find that spatial variation in the dust frequency spectrum, parametrized by $\\beta_d$, can bias the estimate for $r$ when modeled using a low-order moment expansion to capture this spatial variation. While this approach performs well across a broad range of dust complexity, the bias increases with more extreme spatial variation in dust frequency spectrum, reaching as high as $r\\sim0.03$ for simulations with no primordial tensors and a spatial dispersion of $\\sigma(\\beta_d)\\simeq0.3$ -- the most extreme case considered, yet still consistent with current observational constraints. This bias is driven by changes in the $\\ell$-dependence of the dust power spectrum as a function of frequency that can mimic a primordial $B$-mode tensor signal. Although low-order moment expansions fail to capture the full effect when the spatial variations of $\\beta_d$ become large and highly non-Gaussian, our results show that extended parametric methods can still recover unbiased estimates of $r$ under a wide range of dust complexities. We further find that the bias in $r$, at the highest degrees of dust complexity, is largely insensitive to the spatial structure of the dust amplitude and is instead dominated by spatial correlations between $\\beta_d$ and dust amplitude, particularly at higher orders. If $\\beta_d$ does spatially vary at the highest levels investigated here, we would expect to use more flexible foreground models to achieve an unbiased constraint on $r$ for the noise levels anticipated from the Simons Observatory.",

        "abstract": "The non-linear relation between the UV and X-ray luminosity in quasars has been studied for decades. However, as we lack a comprehensive model able to explain it, its investigation still relies on observational efforts. This work focuses on optically selected quasars detected by eROSITA. We present the properties of the sources collected in the eROSITA early data release (eFEDS) and those resulting from the first six months of eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1). We focus on the subset of quasars bright enough in the optical/UV band to avoid an ''Eddington bias'' towards X-ray brighter-than-average spectral energy distributions. The final samples include 1,248 and 519 sources for eFEDS and eRASS1, up to redshift $z\\approx3$ and $z\\approx1.5$, respectively. We found that the X-ray$-$UV luminosity relation shows no significant evolution with redshift, and its slope is in perfect agreement with previous compilations of quasar samples. The intrinsic dispersion of the relation is about 0.2 dex, which is small enough for possible cosmological applications. However, the limited redshift range and statistics of the current samples do not allow us to obtain significant cosmological constraints yet. We show how this is going to change with the future releases of the eROSITA data.",

The abundant production of gauge fields during axion inflation notably sources a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background signal, which nourishes the hope that future GW searches might have a chance to probe the model. In this paper, we scrutinize GW production during axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a powerful numerical technique that captures the nonlinear dynamics of the system in the limit of vanishing axion gradients. We focus on axion inflation coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector, i.e., pure axion inflation (PAI), and perform the first-ever comprehensive parameter scan of GW production in the Abelian PAI model close to the onset of strong backreaction. Remarkably enough, we find that GW signals within the reach of future GW interferometers can only be realized in parameter regions that also lead to strong backreaction and that are in conflict with the upper limit on $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$, i.e., the allowed energy density of dark radiation. This observation defines a clear target for future lattice studies of axion inflation that may confirm or improve the predictions of our GEF benchmark.",

The trajectories are obtained by simultaneously solving baryon-number, electric-charge, and lepton-asymmetry conservation, closed by a state-of-the-art lattice-QCD equation of state: a fourth-order Taylor expansion in the chemical potentials that merges the latest $(2\\!+\\!1)$-flavor susceptibilities with charm-quark contributions, thus delivering a consistent $(2\\!+\\!1\\!+\\!1)$-flavor equation of state. Results are compared with an ideal quark-gluon plasma and with a hadron-resonance gas to highlight interaction effects. Two cases of primordial lepton asymmetries are analyzed: a symmetric configuration $(\\ell_e=\\ell_\\mu=\\ell_\\tau=\\ell/3)$ and an asymmetric one $(\\ell_e=0,\\;\\ell_\\mu=-\\ell_\\tau)$. Increasing $|\\ell|$ systematically drives the trajectories toward larger values of $\\mu_B$ and more negative $\\mu_Q$.

Assuming a modest $\\mu_{Q}$-dependence of the lattice-QCD critical end point estimates (obtained at $\\mu_{Q} = 0$), the trajectories for all lepton asymmetries explored ($|\\ell|\\lesssim 0.1$) lie to their left, implying that in a standard cosmological scenario the QCD transition is almost certainly a smooth crossover.

To address this critical bottleneck, we introduce Flow-Matching Markov Chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC), a pioneering Bayesian framework that synergizes continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with parallel tempering MCMC (PTMCMC). By leveraging CNFs to rapidly explore high-dimensional parameter spaces and PTMCMC for precise posterior sampling, FM-MCMC achieves unprecedented efficiency and accuracy in recovering EMRI intrinsic parameters.

The size of the accretion disc surrounding the black hole is a critical parameter for understanding quasar physics and their potential use as standard candles in cosmology. However, direct measurements of accretion disc sizes have so far been confined to the Local Universe ($z<0.2$), limiting our understanding of quasars during the peak of cosmic activity. Here, we report the first direct measurement of the accretion disc size in the quasar QSO J0455-4216 at $z=2.66$, when the Universe was only $\\sim2$ Gyrs old. Medium-band filters mounted on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at La Silla Observatory were used to isolate continuum emission regions during a six-month monitoring campaign. The light curves exhibit pronounced variability features and enabled the detection of inter-band time delays from different parts of the disc. We mapped the disc and located its ultraviolet-emitting outermost region at $3.02^{+0.33}_{-0.57}$ light-days from the black hole ($\\sim 500$ AU). Given a supermassive black hole 900 million times the mass of the Sun, these measurements validate accretion disc theory at an unprecedented redshift and pave the way for efficient black hole mass estimates, reducing decades-long spectroscopic reverberation campaigns to just a few years or less.",

        "abstract": "HD~5501, a hitherto little studied eclipsing binary with an early A-type primary, has been caught in a short-lived, astrophysically interesting phase of its binary evolution. Recent photometric and spectroscopic observations, including photometric data from {\\it TESS}, show it has a highly variable light curve as well as complex spectral variability, particularly in both the absorption and emission components at H~$\\alpha$. Our current campaign, including both professional and amateur observers, has determined that the primary is evolving rapidly across the Hertzsprung gap and that, unusually in the case of mass transfer, the orbital period is declining with a characteristic time-scale $P/\\dot{P} \\approx$ 170,000 years. Significantly, the orbit is eccentric and it appears that mass transfer from the primary to the secondary occurs only near periastron. Modeling indicates the presumed B7 V secondary to be surrounded by an accretion torus, which likely has dynamically chaotic variations in size and shape. Our analysis further implies the presence of a circumbinary disc or shell supplied by mass loss through the Lagrange $L_3$ point. That mass loss appears to account for most of the emission at H$\\alpha$. We describe how this astrophysically interesting system may yield valuable information about binary star evolution at the onset of Roche-lobe overflow, as well as insights into eccentricity-modifying mechanisms such as the Soker mechanism.",

We present a substantial UV spectroscopic analysis of VW Cephei, a late-type contact binary system, using 46 low-resolution spectra from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) in the wavelength range 1150-1978 \\r{A}. By modelling continuum and emissions lines in individual spectra, we report the significant detection of OIII] (1660 and 1666 \\r{A}) and SiIV (1393 and 1402 \\r{A}) line complexes. We observe that UV fluxes for both continuum and emission lines like CIV, OIII], CII and SiIV vary significantly (fractional rms variability up to 45%) from hours to years. In addition, line widths also change by hundreds of kilometres/sec. The UV flux variabilities observed in the continuum bands and line emissions are uncorrelated. However, most of the flux values follow the binary orbital period observed from optical data. Our analysis indicates that, while the variation in continuum flux may be attributed to a heated photosphere, the line width measurements indicate that the emission lines are likely formed in the dynamical clouds associated with Roche lobe overflow. We estimate the mass transfer rate of $ \\dot{M} = (0.82 \\pm 0.01) \\times 10^{-7} \\ M_{\\odot} {yr^{-1}}$ from UV line fluxes, which is in good agreement with optical studies.",

We also study a cylindrical shape of the emission region and its effect on the isotropy of the emitted radiation. We obtain simple numerical factors that scale the emission for different assumptions about the geometry of the emission region and the distribution of the emitting electrons. For a 3D Gaussian spatial distribution of the electrons we obtain 0.222 times lower flux than for homogeneous emission region. Finally, we also evaluate the absorption of the radiation produced in the different scenarios, and compare the full calculations with the two most commonly assumed simplifications. We find that for cases when the absorption is lesser than by one order of magnitude, the full calculations for homogeneous sphere can be well approximated with homogeneously-emitting slab, while the absorption in the case of 3D Gaussian distribution of electrons is significantly weaker.",

If this radio emission is bright enough, inhabited galaxies themselves form a cosmic population of artificial radio galaxies.

Measured radio source counts set limits on radio broadcasts across the radio spectrum, including the first Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) constraints at ~250 GHz. I compare these with commensal limits from background galaxies in the fields of large SETI surveys. The field limits are more powerful, but generally only over a limited luminosity range and for frequencies with dedicated SETI surveys. The limits are weaker when broadcasts clump into discrete hosts that are themselves extremely rare. I find that the abundance of Kardashev Type III radio broadcast populations is less than one in 10^17 stars, about one in a million large galaxies.

However, definite proofs about the progenitor and central engine of these GRBs have not been directly observed in the past. Here we report the existence of a Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) signature with periodic frequency $\\sim$0.02 Hz in the early X-ray afterglow phase of GRB 220711B. Such a low-frequency QPO likely signals the precession of a relativistic jet launched from a GRB hyper-accreting black hole central engine. The energy injection signature from the \\textbf{late} X-ray observations (from $5\\times 10^2s\\sim 1\\times10^4s$) is consistent with the precession hypothesis. The prompt $\\gamma$-ray light curve does not show any QPO signature, suggesting that the X-ray flaring emission in the early afterglow phase and prompt emission likely originate from different accretion processess, indicating that the progenitor stars of GRBs have a core-envelope structure with a stratified angular momentum distribution and the late-time accretion disk likely has a misalignment with respect to the rotation axis of the black hole. Such a misalignment is not expected in a canonical collapsar model. As a result, the QPO signature in GRB 220711B may reveal a new formation channel of long GRBs, possibly a stellar-merger-induced core collapse, with the orbital angular momentum of the binary misaligned with the spin axis of the collapsing star.",

Simulations are carried out with the kglobal model, which produces bulk heating and the extended powerlaw distributions of both species that have been documented in observations. The simulations have been carried out with a range of proton-to-electron mass ratios and upstream temperatures to isolate the factors that control energy gain. The simulations reveal that when the upstream temperatures of the two species are equal, the proton heating and energization exceeds that of electrons and that this is a consequence of the much larger energy gain of protons on their first entry into the reconnection exhaust. The effective energy gain of protons on exhaust entry scales as $m_iC_A^2$ since the protons counterstream at the Alfv\\'en speed $C_A$ while the initial electron energy gain is smaller by the factor $(\\beta_{e0}m_e/m_i)^{1/2}$. Since Fermi reflection during flux rope merger dominates energy gain in large-scale reconnecting systems and the rate of energy gain is proportional to energy, protons continue to gain energy faster than electrons for the duration of the simulations, leading to temperature increments of protons exceeding that of electrons and the non-thermal energy content of protons also exceeding that of electrons.",

Once produced, the RHNs emit gravitons through bremsstrahlung as they decay into the Standard Model (SM) particles via $N\\rightarrow \\ell + H$, enabled by the unavoidable minimal coupling to gravity, sourcing a stochastic GW background.

        "abstract": "We aim to characterize the physical and activity properties of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS through spectroscopic and photometric observations during the first month after its discovery. We performed time-series photometry and long-slit spectroscopy between 2 and 29 July 2025 using multiple ground-based telescopes. Photometric data were calibrated against field stars from the ATLAS and APASS catalogs, and Fourier analysis was applied to derive the comet's rotational period. Spectral data were obtained using the SALT telescope and Nordic Optical Telescope. We report a spin period of $16.16 \\pm 0.01$ h with a lightcurve amplitude of approximately 0.3 mag. The comet exhibits increasing dust activity and reddening colors during the observation period, with no visible tail detected, likely due to viewing geometry and low dust production. Dust mass loss rates are estimated between 0.3 and 4.2 kg s^-1, consistent with weakly active distant comets. Spectral colors are similar to those of outer Solar System comets and differ from previously reported values for 3I/ATLAS. The morphological and photometric properties of 3I/ATLAS are consistent with a weakly active comet of outer Solar System origin, despite its interstellar provenance. Continued monitoring around perihelion is necessary to track changes in activity, color, which will provide insights into the evolution of interstellar materials under solar radiation.",

        "abstract": "The Subaru-Asahi StarCam is a high-sensitivity live-streaming camera for meteor observation, installed on the dome of the Subaru Telescope at the summit area of Maunakea, Hawai'i. Although it was originally intended to share the Maunakea night sky with the public, including the local Hawai'i community, the system quickly demonstrated its potential for scientific research, owing to its highly sensitive video capabilities and the exceptional fraction of clear nights at the site. The core of the StarCam system features a Sony FX3 camera body paired with an F1.4 wide-angle lens, offering a field of view of 70 deg by 40 deg. Leveraging a state-of-the-art, high-sensitivity CMOS sensor and a bright lens, the system is capable of capturing stars as faint as magnitude 8 in real-time, with an effective frame rate of 15--30 fps. Live streaming via YouTube began in April 2021, and the feed is constantly monitored by more than a hundred viewers at any given nighttime. This has enabled the camera to be used not only for observing regular meteor showers but also for monitoring scientifically important phenomena such as fireballs or unexpected meteor outbursts. Notable scientific achievements include: 1) Detection of the new Arid meteor shower in 2021, 2) Identification of a sub-peak activity in the Gamma-Perseid meteor shower (2021), 3) Detection of the 2022 Tau-Herculid meteor shower outburst, 4) Confirmation of the activity of the Andromedid meteor shower (2021), and 5) Multiple detections of meteor cluster phenomena. We discuss the potential and the future scope of StarCam as an open-access, real-time data platform for citizen science in meteor observations.",

By systematically exploring parameter spaces and comparing theoretical predictions with recent observational constraints, we establish constraints on the chiral invariant mass. Our results suggest that more than a half of the nucleon mass originates from sources beyond spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, challenging conventional understanding of nucleon mass generation. These constraints arise solely from fundamental physical principles and observational data, independent of specific assumptions about the nature of the quark-hadron transition, providing robust insights into the microscopic origin of hadron masses.",

        "abstract": "Cosmic microwave background data from the Planck satellite, combined with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Type Ia supernovae from various samples, provide hints of dynamical dark energy (DE). These results indicate a peak in the DE density around $z\\sim 0.4-0.5$, with the highest significance observed when using the supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey. In this Letter, we show that this peak does not necessarily imply a true crossing of the phantom divide if the measured effective DE is not a single component, but a combination of standard and negative quintessence. The latter is characterized by negative energy density and positive pressure, both decreasing in absolute value and tending to 0 in the future. For appropriate values of the parameters, negative quintessence is relevant at intermediate redshifts and becomes subdominant in front of standard quintessence around $z\\sim 0.4-0.5$, giving rise to the aforementioned peak in the DE density. We find that our model is preferred over $\\Lambda$CDM at a $3.27\\sigma$ CL, which is comparable to the level of exclusion found with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. Our analysis leaves open the possibility of negative quintessence and other exotic fields existing in the low-energy universe, potentially playing a significant role in cosmic dynamics.",

At the contrast levels required to detect and characterize terrestrial planets, these effects may become significant. Instrumentally induced polarization is often referred to as ``incoherent,\" yet this use of the term lacks rigor. This work uses Jones calculus and vector field simulations, including interactions with dielectric surfaces to show that the secondary polarization is fully coherent with the input field, but it does not interfere with it due to orthogonality. A key consequence of the coherence secondary polarization is that the process of creating a dark hole in the primary polarization tends to also significantly mitigate the intensity corresponding to the secondary polarization, called the \\emph{secondary intensity}, in the dark hole region. This reduction of the secondary intensity may lead to relaxed polarization design requirements in future coronagraphs. Additionally, if the contrast is sufficient to make the secondary intensity non-negligible, modulation schemes to separate the planet from the instrumental light need to account for the modulation of the secondary intensity.",

        "abstract": "We present the results of a search for megaparsec-scale sources in the NVGRC catalog of candidates of giant radio source (GRS) based on the NVSS sky survey. We visually inspected 370 NVGRC sources, as well as radio sources falling within a neighborhood of about one square degree around the target object. In the studied sample, 48% of objects were classified as giant radio sources, 14% as sources with a projected linear size of less than 0.72 Mpc, and 38\\% as physically unrelated objects combined by the recognition algorithm into one radio source. We identified 197 gaints, of which 72 radio sources are known GRGs or GRQs, and 125 sources were identified by us as GRS for the first time. Comparing the proportion of FRI giants in four redshift bins, we found that for z0.15 the proportion of FRI giants decreases sharply. The predominance of FRII giants in the GRS lists is most likely due to observational selection due to the sensitivity limit of existing radio surveys. Comparing the NVSS and VLASS cutouts, we found that 33% of sources can be classified as fadded. 25% of the sources show a restart of the radio source phase. 38% of the sources have deformed radio lobes. Our GRS sample includes 74% of galaxies, 15% of IR-excess galaxies, which, according to the WISE photometric data, can be attributed to quasars, and 11% of quasars. When visually examining the optical survey cutouts, we noted the presence of close neighbors for the hosts and/or their belonging to known groups or clusters of galaxies. Close neighbors at a distance of less than 50 kpc were found for 39% of radio sources, and 28% of sources are part of groups or clusters of galaxies. Thus, about 70% of gaints are in a fairly dense environment, and this proportion may be higher.",

These systems are very prominent sources for testing gravity in the strong gravity fields and for probing potential deviations from general relativity, including those arising from the presence of fundamental scalar fields. In this work, we examine the impact of a scalar charge carried by the inspiraling object within the context of EMRIs. We focus on generic orbits that present both eccentricity and inclination to evaluate how these parameters affect the modifications induced by the scalar charge to the gravitational wave signal. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of orbital inclination, in particular, enhances the detectability of scalar field effects by introducing richer waveform features that deviate from the purely general relativistic case. The interplay among scalar charge, eccentricity and inclination provides a more complete sampling of the black hole spacetime, suggesting that EMRIs with such generic orbits represent compelling systems for stringently constraining or discovering new fundamental fields through future gravitational wave observations.",

        "abstract": "We present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of GRB 240825A, a bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected by Fermi and Swift, with a prompt duration ($T_{\\rm 90}$ ~ 4 sec in 50-300 keV) near the boundary separating short and long GRBs, prompting a detailed investigation into its classification and progenitor. Using classical prompt metrics (duration, minimum variability timescale (MVT), lag, and spectral hardness) and modern classification techniques (machine-learning (ML) based t-SNE, support vector machine, energy-hardness-duration, and $\\epsilon \\equiv E_{\\gamma,\\mathrm{iso},52} / E_{p,z,2}^{5/3}$), we find GRB 240825A exhibits hybrid characteristics. The short MVT (13.830 $\\pm$ 1.574 ms), rest-frame duration, and ML-based classification indicate a merger-like or ambiguous nature, while its energetics and position on the Amati relation favor a collapsar origin. We conducted deep optical and NIR photometric and spectroscopic late-time search for an associated supernova (SN)/kilonova (KN) and the host galaxy using 10.4 m GTC and 8.4 m binocular LBT telescopes. No bright SN (like SN 1998bw) is detected down to stringent limits (e.g., $m_r > 26.1$ mag at 17.59 days), despite a redshift of $z$ = 0.659 measured from GTC spectroscopy. Host galaxy SED modeling with Prospector indicates a massive, dusty, and star-forming galaxy-typical of collapsar GRB hosts, though with low sSFR and large offset. We compare these findings with hybrid events like GRB 211211A, GRB 230307A, GRB 200826A, including SNe-GRBs, and conclude that GRB 240825A likely originated from a massive star collapse, with the associated supernova obscured by a dusty host environment or low luminosity SN with absolute magnitude M$_{V}$ fainter than -18.0. This study emphasizes the need for multiwavelength follow-up and a multi-layered classification to determine GRB progenitors.",

        "abstract": "The $\\gamma$-ray light curve of long-duration GRB 220711B, is characterized by a multi-peaked structure with a duration lasting $\\sim$105 seconds. More interestingly, the X-ray afterglow light curve is composed of a plateau emission smoothly connected with a $\\sim t^{-2}$ segment overlapping some flares followed by an extremely steep decay. By analysing the light curves of both prompt emission and X-ray afterglow, no high-confidence-level quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signals are found in the light curves of the prompt emission (e.g., BAT and GBM), but it is found that a QPO signal at $\\sim$ 50 s above 6$\\sigma$ confidence level indeed exist in the X-ray afterglow. Here, we propose that a supra-massive magnetar as the central engine of GRB 220711B with precession motion is a good interpretation of the features of the X-ray emission. The initial plateau emission and followed decay segment, as well as the extremely steep-decay segment, are consistent with the physical process of supra-massive magnetar spin-down and then collapse into black hole. Moreover, the QPO signal in the X-ray emission can be explained as an effect of the precession motion of the magnetar. If this is the case, one can derive various magnetar parameters such as the initial period ($P_{{\\rm{0}}}$) and surface magnetic field strength ($B_{{\\rm{p}}}$) within a pseudo-redshift range of [1.08, 4.27]. By considering beaming corrections with jet opening angle $5^{\\circ}$, we find that $P_{{\\rm{0}}}$ and $B_{{\\rm{p}}}$ lie within the range of [1.87, 6.25] ms and [$1.47\\times 10^{16}$, $3.09\\times 10^{16}$] G, respectively. The parameter of $B_{{\\rm{p}}}$ is slightly larger than that of other typical long-duration GRBs, but $P_{{\\rm{0}}}$ fall in a reasonable range.",

The twist and tilt of the BMR magnetic field are modeled as a result of an effective electromotive force along the rising part of the toroidal magnetic field. This force generates the poloidal field that tilts the whole magnetic configuration. We find that variations of BMR's twist and tilt determine the magnitude and the sign of the magnetic helicity flux on the solar surface. The model shows that the helicity flux associated with the BMR's tilt/twist is the dominant contribution to the BMR helicity at the beginning of the BMR's evolution, while the effect of differential rotation is the main source of the helicity flux at the final stage of the BMR's evolution. We discuss the implications of these effects on the basic properties and variations of the hemispheric helicity rule of active regions on the solar surface.",

In this work, we analyze the photon time-of-flight and time-shift data from LHAASO observations of Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 221009A to search for signatures of Lorentz violation. We employed the DisCan (dispersion cancellation) method with various information entropies as cost functions, designating the results obtained with Shannon entropy as our representative outcome. This choice is attributed to the parameter-free statistical properties of Shannon entropy, which has demonstrated remarkable stability as we continually refine and enhance our methodology. In the absence of more detailed data and physical context, it provides more stable and reliable results. We constrain the energy scale associated with Lorentz invariance violation. Our results yield 95\\% confidence level lower limits of $E_{\\text{QG},1} > 5.4 \\times 10^{19} \\, \\text{GeV}$ (subluminal) and $E_{\\text{QG},1} > 2.7 \\times 10^{19} \\, \\text{GeV}$ (superluminal) for the linear case ($n$=1), and $E_{\\text{QG},2} > 10.0 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\text{GeV}$ (subluminal) and $E_{\\text{QG},2} > 2.4 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\text{GeV}$ (superluminal) for the quadratic case ($n$=2). Subsequently, we incorporated WCDA photons and the Knuth binning method to further optimize and complement our approach, while also performing filter using information entropies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that employing different information entropy measures as cost functions does not alter the order of magnitude of these constraints.",

CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. It has been proposed as a constellation of a two Cubesat mission to monitor the Sun for Space Weather, and will proceed with a single-satellite asset in its baseline implementation.   In the frame of CUSP's Phase B study, that started in December 2024 for a 1-year period, we present the development status of this dual-phase polarimeter. Preliminary laboratory results using two chains of acquisition will be discussed. The first chain of acquisition, based on the Hamamatsu R7600 multi-anode photomultiplier tubes coupled to plastic scintillator bars and read out by the MAROC-3A ASIC, is used to detect the Compton scattering of incoming photons. On the other hand, GAGG crystals coupled to avalanche photo-diodes with a readout based on the SKIROC-2A ASIC are used to absorb the scattered photons. By reconstructing the azimuthal scattering direction for many incoming photons, one can infer the linear polarization degree and angle of the source. We will discuss the calibration results obtained with our prototype detector by using well-known radioactive isotopes, allowing us to assess the performances of our detector over the full 25-100 keV energy range.",

        "abstract": "By reentering into laser interferometers, scattered or stray light introduces non-linear noise. This is a major limitation of precision interferometers as preventing such parasitic light is nearly impossible. Thus, substantial effort is put into mitigating the reentering of these fields in various ways. Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors employ such mitigation techniques to reduce otherwise restrictive stray light noise. However, they are now reaching sensitivities where conventional mitigation techniques reach limitations. Further improvements planed for future observatories are placing even more demanding constraints on tolerable stray light power. We previously presented tunable coherence as a possible technique to ease these constraints and suppress unwanted coherent interference. For these promising demonstrations, the remaining coherence length and achievable suppression in length-constrained layouts was limited, among other things, by the used pseudo-random-noise phase modulation frequency. In this work, we demonstrate stray light suppression and cavity performance at modulation frequencies up to 10 GHz. This reduces the remaining coherence to a few centimeter in an interferometer, and even to the scale of the laser wavelength in a cavity. We further present a first demonstration of tunable coherence in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer, successfully suppressing stray light in a more complex topology.",

Only the flat universe hypothesis is considered. Constraints from 158 lensing systems and the Pantheon+ sample show no significant evidence of $G$ variation. However, although the results are compatible with no variation, the errors are not yet sufficiently restrictive to rule out any variation of $G$ with high statistical confidence.

Nonlinear electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of curvature parameters and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number $n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and dynamical properties.",

        "abstract": "Double-peaked \\oiii~profiles could potentially indicate kiloparsec-scale dual AGNs. We analyze long-term optical light curves of 35 type 1 AGNs with such features from our recent catalog in Zheng et al. (2025). These light curves are obtained from the Catalina Sky Survey and modeled using a Damped Random Walk (DRW) process. A control sample of 210 normal type 1 AGNs matched in redshift, intrinsic luminosity, and black hole mass is also studied. If the double-peaked \\oiii~are caused by two type 1 AGNs (dual type 1 AGN), then the combined variability from the two AGNs would be expected to differ from that of a single type 1 AGN. However, there is no statistically significant difference in the variability timescale $\\tau$ and intrinsic variability amplitude $\\sigma$ between these double-peaked AGNs and the control sample of 210 normal type 1 AGNs. Crucially, computer simulations reveal that dual AGN systems systematically produce lower variability amplitudes than single AGNs, which is inconsistent with the observed variability properties of our double-peaked \\oiii~sample. Moreover, simulations suggest that the fraction of dual type 1 AGNs is $\\sim$ 3\\%, indicating that double-peaked \\oiii~may not be a reliable indicator of dual type 1 AGNs in these systems. However, this does not rule out the possibility that some objects may still host dual AGNs involving other combinations, such as type 1+type 2 AGNs. Future studies with larger samples and higher-quality light curves will help clarify the true nature of these systems.",

        "title": "Measuring Local Turbulence Along the Optical Path: Multi-beam Optical Seeing Sensor (MOSS)",
        "abstract": "Deflection of light along the optical path is a major source of image degradation for ground-based telescopes. Methods have been developed to measure upper atmospheric seeing based on models of the turbulence in the atmosphere, but due to boundary conditions, transmission within telescope enclosures is more complex. The Multi-beam Optical Seeing Sensor (MOSS) directly measures the component of the image quality degradation from inhomogeneity of the index of refraction within the telescope dome. MOSS outputs four near-parallel beams of light that travel along the optical path and are imaged by the telescope's detector, landing like starlight on the telescope's focal plane. By using a strobed light source, we can 'freeze' the instantaneous index variations transverse to the optical path. This system captures both 'dome' and 'mirror' seeing. Through plotting the standard deviation of differential motion between pairs of beams, MOSS enables characterization of the length scale of turbulence within the dome. The temporal coherence of temperature gradients can be probed with different pulse lengths, and the spatial coherence by comparing pairs at different separations across the aperture of the telescope. Optical path turbulence measurements, alongside other telemetry metrics, will guide thermal and airflow management to optimize image quality. A MOSS prototype was installed in the 1.2 meter Auxiliary Telescope (AuxTel) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, and preliminary data constrain the optical path turbulence with a lower bound of 1.4 arcseconds. The optical path turbulence varied throughout the night of observing.",

        "title": "Prompt identification of solar wind stream interaction regions from Survey Burst 1 Mode observations of the Radio and Plasma Wave experiment on Solar Orbiter",
        "abstract": "Studying stream interaction regions (SIRs), from their inception and the dynamics of their development, can provide insight into solar-terrestrial connections. Some in-situ instruments on the Solar Orbiter (SolO) space mission are designed to measure solar wind (SW) and interplanetary magnetic field parameters along the flight path. These instruments are ideal for studying the dynamics of SIR evolution at heliocentric distances of 0.28-1.0 AU and with changes in heliolatitude of 0^{\\circ} - 33^{\\circ}. To address the challenges of promptly identifying SIRs and predicting their arrival time on Earth, we consider using trigger events from the Radio and Plasma Wave (RPW)/SolO instrument, which are transmitted in telemetry data packages. We suggest that multiple activations of the trigger mode (SBM1 mode) in the RPW instrument over an interval of up to four hours may reflect the fine structure of large-scale events in SW. Such events can serve as markers for the spacecraft's location within the SIR. In this regard, the 2023 analysis revealed that multiple activations of the SBM1 trigger mode throughout the day accounted for more than 50\\% of the total number of days for which such events were recorded. Of this number, 63\\% were events when the trigger algorithm was prompted repeatedly within a time interval of up to four hours. A comparison of the registration times of SBM1 trigger events with the SW parameters obtained from the SWA-PAS and MAG instruments showed that repeated activations of the trigger algorithm occurred at the stream interface surface when a high-speed SW stream and a formed compression region were present.",

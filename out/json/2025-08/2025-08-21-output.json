        "abstract": "This work investigates the initial mass and chemical evolution history of the Gaia-Enceladus dwarf galaxy. We combine spectroscopic data from APOGEE with astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to identify Gaia-Enceladus candidate stars via a machine-learning pipeline using t-SNE and HDBSCAN. By focusing on kinematic and chemical parameters, especially $\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$, $\\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]}$, $\\mathrm{[Al/Fe]}$, and $\\mathrm{[Mn/Fe]}$, we uncover a population of metal-poor, high-eccentricity stars that align with literature criteria for Gaia-Enceladus debris. We then apply the \\textit{OMEGA+} chemical evolution model, incorporating MCMC fitting of the observed abundance trends in the $\\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]\\times[Fe/H]}$ plane. Our best-fitting model indicates a gas mass of $4.93_{-0.72}^{+0.32}\\times10^9\\,{M_{\\odot}}$ for Gaia-Enceladus, placing it at the higher end of previously suggested mass ranges. The model scenario suggests a short star formation timescale, substantial outflows, and a rapid build-up of metals mainly driven by core-collapse supernovae, with a lesser contribution from Type~Ia supernovae. Comparison with observational data in other chemical planes (e.g., $\\mathrm{[Mg/Mn]\\times[Al/Fe]}$) supports this scenario, emphasizing a distinct evolution path relative to the Milky Way. Additionally, our results provide indirect evidence that star formation in Gaia-Enceladus likely ceased within the first 4 Gyr, consistent with earlier inferences of an early merger event. These findings highlight the power of chemical evolution modeling in reconstructing the origin and mass of ancient accreted systems. Overall, we show that Gaia-Enceladus, through a rapid star formation and strong outflows, contributed a significant fraction of the metal-poor stellar halo of the Milky Way.",

        "abstract": "Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal young massive clusters (YMCs) as key building blocks of early galaxies. They are not only important constituents of galaxies, but also potential birthplaces of very massive stars (VMSs) and black hole (BH) seeds. We explore stellar dynamics in extremely dense clusters with initial half-mass densities of $\\rho_h \\gtrsim 10^8M_\\odot{\\rm pc}^{-3}$ at very low metallicity, comparable to some of the densest clusters seen by JWST. Using direct N-body and Monte Carlo simulations with stellar evolution, we show that VMS formation through collisions is unavoidable, with final masses reaching $5\\times10^3$ to $4\\times10^4M_\\odot$. These results support the existence of a critical mass scale above which collisions become highly efficient, enabling the formation of VMSs and intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs). Our models, using nbody6++gpu and MOCCA with updated SSE/BSE routines, show that dense clusters rapidly form VMSs via stellar bombardment. The VMSs then collapse into BH seeds of a few $10^3$ to $10^4M_\\odot$ in less than 4 Myr. We identify a critical mass-density threshold beyond which clusters undergo runaway collisions that yield massive BH seeds. For typical YMCs detected by JWST, efficiencies up to 10% are expected, implying BH masses up to $10^5M_\\odot$ if formed via collisions. We predict a scaling relation for BH mass, $\\log(M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\odot)=-0.76+0.76\\log(M/M_\\odot)$.

        "abstract": "Envelope stripping, whether through single-star wind mass loss or binary mass transfer, is a key evolutionary pathway for the formation of classical Wolf-Rayet stars and lower-mass stripped helium (He) stars. However, to study the evolution of these objects into black holes, neutron stars, and stripped-envelope supernovae, we need appropriate input models for the core-He burning phase without relying on the uncertain evolution into this evolved phase. Reliable mass-luminosity relations (MLRs) for He stars are needed for stellar wind and evolution studies, but the MLRs currently in literature are either for fully-stripped or chemically homogeneous stars, neither of which reflect the important and recently also observationally confirmed stage of partial stripping. We alleviate this drawback by computing sets of MESA synthetic structure models with partially-stripped chemical profiles, consisting of a pure-He core and a hydrogen (H)-depleted envelope with an H/He chemical gradient left behind from the receding convective core during the main sequence. As the H slope increases from 0 (full chemical homogeneity) to $\\infty$ (pure-He stars) in our synthetic models, we find the luminosity to initially increase before eventually decreasing. The maximum luminosity for a given mass is reached for an intermediate H-profile slope corresponding to a partially-stripped structure, exceeding even the values documented for pure-He stars, primarily due to the H shell disproportionately dominating the total luminosity budget. We also provide convenient mass-luminosity fit relations to predict the minimum, maximum, and pure-He luminosities for a given mass -- and vice versa -- while accounting for structures achievable through partial stripping. We also explore the impact of the higher luminosity on the wind properties of partially-stripped configurations using hydrodynamically consistent atmosphere models.",

The scope of such an interaction has recently been studied from different astrophysical properties of its star cluster population, which point to star clusters placed remarkably outside the known extension of the galaxy. In this work we report results for three of the recently identified most external SMC star clusters, OGLE-CL-SMC0133, OGLE-CL-SMC0237, and Lindsay~116, using deep GEMINI GMOS imaging. Once we confidently cleaned their color-magnitude diagrams from field star contamination, we estimated their fundamental parameters applying likelihood techniques. We also derived their structural parameters from normalized star number density radial profiles. Based on {\\it Gaia} astrometric data, complemented with kinematics information available in the literature, we computed the 3D components of their space velocities. With similar ages (~ 2.2 Gyr) and moderately metal-poor overall abundances ([Fe/H] = -1.0 - -0.7 dex), OGLE-CL-SMC0237 is placed at 2.6 kpc from the SMC center and shares its disk rotation; OGLE-CL-SMC0133 is located at 7.6 kpc from the galaxy center and exhibits a kinematics marginally similar to the SMC rotation disk, while Lindsay~116 placed at 15.7 kpc from the center of the SMC is facing strong perturbations of its orbital motion with respect to an ordered rotational trajectory. Furthermore, its internal dynamical evolution would seem to be accelerated -- it seems kinematically older -- in comparison with star clusters in the outskirts of relatively isolated galaxies. These outcomes lead to conclude that Lindsay~116 is subject to LMC tides.",

At the same time, stellar models are moving forward to comprehend the discrepancy between the primordial lithium abundance predicted by the standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis theory and the measured value of old dwarf stars. In this work, we follow the evolution of $^7$Li in the galactic thin disc starting from a primordial value of A(Li)=2.69 dex and applying $^7$Li depletion corrections of the stellar model with overshooting to our chemical evolution models. We use the upper envelope of the observational data to constrain the models. In addition to the dwarf main sequence (MS) stars, our analysis includes, for the first time, the early red-giant-branch (RGB) stars. Besides the renowned Spite plateau of the MS stars at low metallicities, we also confirm the existence of a second A(Li) plateau of the early RGB stars, which can be explained by our model with the corrections from stellar models. Our best-fit model is obtained with an effective averaged $^7$Li yield $^{Li}Y_\\mathrm{Nova}=2.34\\times 10^{-5} M_\\odot$ during the whole lifetime of a nova. This reinforces the possibility that novae are the main galactic $^7$Li source, together with the stellar models' ability to comprehend the \"cosmological lithium problem\" in this context.",

Using detailed MESA simulations of binary evolution, we find that these oCZs are not numerical artefacts but emerge due to a local increase in density near the retreating edge of the convective core. The density enhancement raises the local opacity, which amplifies the radiative temperature gradient $\\nabla_{\\rm rad}$. If this gradient surpasses the Ledoux threshold $\\nabla_{\\rm L}$, defined by both thermal and compositional stratification, the region becomes convectively unstable. The resulting oCZs are detached from the convective core and transient: mixing within the oCZ erases the local gradient in mean molecular weight, leaving a sharp $\\nabla_{\\mu}$ discontinuity at the boundary, stabilizing the adjacent layers. This mechanism naturally explains the presence and evolution of oCZs, as previously reported in massive interacting stars.",

        "abstract": "Pulsating detached eclipsing binary systems are crucial for studying the internal structure of oscillating stars. These systems are advantageous because binary effects on pulsations are minimal, allowing for more accurate determinations of fundamental stellar parameters such as mass and radius. They serve as unique laboratories for detailed investigations of pulsating stars. In this study, we focused on four detached eclipsing binaries exhibiting $\\delta$ Scuti-type oscillations: HD 117476, 205 Dra, HY Vir, and V1031 Ori. Our preliminary investigation showed that all binary components of these targets lie within the $\\delta$ Scuti instability strip. Therefore, we aimed to determine which components are pulsating and which are not, and to explore the differences between them. To achieve this, we analyzed TESS photometric data and high-resolution spectra of the targets. Radial velocity variations were measured, and atmospheric parameters for each component were derived using spectral disentangling or synthetic composite spectra. We also modeled the binary light and radial velocity curves to determine the fundamental physical parameters of the components. Furthermore, we examined pulsation properties using three different approaches to identify the pulsating components. The evolutionary status of the targets was also assessed. Our analysis revealed that, in each system, only one component exhibits $\\delta$ Scuti-type pulsations, while the others are non-pulsating. Interestingly, we found that the key difference between pulsating and non-pulsating components within the same binary is metallicity: the metal-rich components were found to be non-pulsators, supporting theoretical studies on the effect of metallicity on $\\delta$ Scuti-type pulsations.",

        "abstract": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered a new population of objects, the Little Red Dots (LRDs), characterized by V-shaped spectra indicative of strong breaks around the Balmer limit and compact morphology that gave them their name. A popular explanation is that they are a sub-population of active galactic nuclei/supermassive black holes (AGN/SMBHs) predominantly found in the high-redshift Universe ($z\\gtrsim3$). Similarly, direct collapse black holes (DCBHs), theorized to form from collapsing massive, extremely metal-poor gas clouds, have been invoked to explain high-redshift quasars, the most massive AGN sub-population. Here, we employ the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH to produce a population of DCBHs and compare them against observed LRD demographics and properties. Specifically, we compare the DCBH-seeded SMBH population against the standard stellar-remnant seeds and find that DCBH models agree better with observed LRD population statistics and host halo properties. Furthermore, for the most extreme and earliest LRD detections, interpreted to be systems with an AGN but little stellar component, DCBHs are able to reproduce the observed spectral shape and properties under multiple scenarios - high dust attenuation or AGN surrounded by dense gas - that have been proposed to explain the unique shape of LRD spectra. Even when super-Eddington accretion, invoked previously to explain the nature of LRDs, is enforced on stellar remnant seeds, the spectral characteristics of extreme LRDs cannot be reproduced. We emphasize the importance of gas-metallicity observations as an additional dimension besides the widely used SMBH-stellar mass ratios to further constrain the progenitors of LRDs.",

I present an example of a tidally induced bar-like galaxy formed at z = 2.9 in the TNG100 suite of the IllustrisTNG simulations. The galaxy was identified among the sample of bar-like galaxies studied before and has the earliest bar formation time among the tidally induced subsample of those objects. Its disk transformed into a bar as a result of a close interaction with a massive progenitor of a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). It remained on a tight orbit around the host and survived until the present, losing most of its initial mass and becoming red but preserving its prolate shape. Even before the interaction, at z = 3.5, the galaxy experienced a few mergers, which elongated its shape. This temporary distortion also made it look like a bar with spiral extensions of up to 6 kpc. The long-lived bar formed later was about 3 kpc long and grew over the next few gigayears. This example demonstrates that high-z bars should not be sought among the progenitors of present-day simulated barred galaxies but rather among the tidally interacting early population of galaxies in forming groups and clusters. Some of these galaxies may have survived as ellipticals, and some may have merged with their BCGs.",

        "abstract": "Molecular clouds (MCs) are cradles of star and planet formation, thereby playing an important role in the evolution of galaxies. Based on the unbiased Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey data of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O (J=1--0) line emission in two regions toward the inner and outer Galaxy, i.e. the G50 ($44.75\\deg \\le l \\le 60.25\\deg$) and G120 ($119.75\\deg \\le l \\le 130.25\\deg$) regions, the distribution of molecular gas is studied. Both regions have Galactic latitudes of $|b| \\le 5.25\\deg$. A catalog containing 24724 MCs is constructed from the data. In our proximity, several molecular structures with large angular scales and small velocity dispersions are discovered, resembling curtains of mist. Beyond the nearby molecular gas, a clear aggregation of MCs along coherent structures in the Galactic plane is visible, sketching spiral arm structures. Nevertheless, the aggregation of MCs is also detected in the inter-arm region between the Perseus and Outer arms in the G50 region. The Galactic molecular disk in this inter-arm region is found to be thinner than that in the adjacent spiral arm region. In addition, the thickness of the Galactic molecular disk examined here is found to be correlated with the warp of it, indicating their homologous origins. The molecular disk has a typical thickness of ~220 pc in the inner Galaxy. Moreover, the dispersion of the MC systemic velocity decreases with increasing galactocentric radius, resulting in lower kinematic distance uncertainties at larger radii. However, the Perseus arm segment in the G120 region exhibits a relatively large cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersion and split components in its MC velocity distribution.",

Observatories like {\\it Chandra}, LIGO, and more recently, {\\it Gaia}, have provided valuable insights into the configurations of these elusive objects when residing in binary systems. Motivated by these advances, we study, for the first time, the enhanced accretion of metals from the interstellar medium (ISM) onto low-mass companions in binary systems with highly unequal mass ratios, utilizing a series of hydrodynamical simulations. Our study demonstrates that a stellar companion's metal accretion history from the ISM alone, from its formation to the present, can significantly influence its surface abundances, especially when enhanced by a massive black hole companion. However, this effect is likely only measurable in stars that are still in the main sequence. Once a stellar companion evolves off the main sequence, similar to what has been observed with the {\\it Gaia} BH3 companion, the initial dredge-up process are likely to erase any excess surface abundance resulting from the metals that were accreted. As we discover more unequal mass ratio binary systems, it is crucial to understand how the observed metallicity of sun-like companions may differ from their birth metallicity, especially if they are not yet evolved.",

We present an extensive study of the Ly$\\alpha$ evolution from galaxies at 4.5 $\\leq$ z $\\leq$ 11 in the UDS field, observed as part of the CAPERS survey, and complemented with spectra from the DAWN JWST Archive. The combined sample includes 651 spectroscopically confirmed Ly$\\alpha$-break galaxies, among which we find 73 S/N>3 LAEs in JWST-NIRSpec PRISM spectra. We trace the redshift evolution of the Ly$\\alpha$ emitter fraction with EW$_0$ >25 A (X$_{\\mathrm{Ly\\alpha}}$) between z = 5 and z = 9, presenting the first such analysis in the UDS field. At z = 5 and 6, the UDS results agree with the average JWST X$_{\\mathrm{Ly\\alpha}}$ values from multiple fields. However, JWST measurements are consistently lower than ground-based results. To investigate this, we compare JWST observations to a population of star-forming galaxies at z$\\sim$6 observed with VLT-FORS2. We find that a Ly$\\alpha$ slit-loss of 35 $\\pm$ 10% in JWST spectra accounts for the offset, as the resonant Ly$\\alpha$ emission is more spatially extended than the stellar continuum. From z = 6 to 7, the UDS field shows a significant drop in Ly$\\alpha$ visibility, from which we infer a neutral hydrogen fraction of X$_{\\mathrm{HI}}$ = 0.7--0.9. Finally, we identify two robust ionized bubbles at z = 7.29 and 7.77, with radii of $R_{\\mathrm{ion}}$ = 0.6 and 0.5 physical Mpc and photometric overdensities of N/$\\langle$N$\\rangle$ = 3 and 4, based on candidate counts down to the photometric completeness limit.

        "abstract": "Identifying the nucleosynthesis processes behind heavy-element enrichment in stellar atmospheres is challenging. It typically relies on comparing observed abundance-to-iron ratios with theoretical predictions relative to the Sun, but this method is prone to uncertainty due to limitations of classical 1D hydrostatic models. One promising but still underexplored approach is to measure the isotopic composition of stellar atmospheres by focusing on elements that have both slow (s)-process and rapid (r)-process contributions. While the study of total elemental abundances offers a simplified view, isotopic ratios are directly linked to the underlying nucleosynthesis processes. Our aim is to provide a reliable method for quantifying the contributions of the s- and r-processes to barium in stellar atmospheres. This is achieved by determining barium isotopic ratios using 1D atmospheric models in combination with a carefully calibrated microturbulence, based on the comparison between subordinate and resonance Ba lines. In this initial study, we use member stars of the globular cluster NGC 6752 to calibrate the microturbulence ($v_{mic}$) value for both subordinate and resonance barium lines across different stellar evolutionary stages. This allows us to provide a reliable estimate of $v_{mic}$ that can be applied to accurately determine barium abundances and isotopic ratios in stars ranging from the main sequence to the upper red giant branch. The $v_{mic}$ scale adapted for barium subordinate lines is consistent with that derived from 3D model atmospheres, and thus the $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$-log $g$ dependent relations of the later can be used safely. The $v_{mic}$ for the resonance line at $\\lambda$4934 Angstrom -- for the determination of the isotopic ratio -- is higher, and depends on the equivalent width (EW). We provide calibrated relations between $v_{mic}$ and EW for measuring isotopic ratios.",

The observations cover the spectral range 4650-9300 $\\r{A}$ and provide a $1\\times1$ arcmin$^{2}$ field of view, encompassing nearly the entire remnant. We analyse the spatial and spectral properties of shock-related emission lines, and identify clumpy optical shock emission e.g. from [S II] $\\lambda\\lambda$6716,6731 doublet and the coronal [Fe XIV] $\\lambda$5303 line (typically at radial velocities $\\lesssim|100|$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\\lesssim|170|$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively). These features trace the blast-wave shell seen in previous X-ray studies. Post-shock electron density estimates, based on the [S II]-line ratio, reveal spatial variation, with the highest densities ($\\sim10^4$ cm$^{-3}$) in the bright knots in the west, and lower densities ($\\sim3\\times10^3$ cm$^{-3}$) in the east. The density in the north (southwest) appears significantly lower (higher) but remains unconstrained due to limited signal. We also estimate blast-wave shock velocities using the [Fe XIV] $\\lambda$5303/[Fe XI] $\\lambda$7892 ratio, finding low velocities ($\\sim400$ km s$^{-1}$), consistent with previous studies. All these results support the scenario that the blast wave is interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium, particularly in the western regions. Additionally, we detect four unidentified emission lines, $\\sim$2000-3000 km s$^{-1}$ south from the pulsar in transverse velocity, but their origin remains unclear. Possible explanations, including Fe lines from a high-velocity ejecta clump, all present challenges.

PRIME is the first dedicated near-infrared (NIR) microlensing survey telescope located at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in Sutherland, South Africa. Among its class, it offers one of the widest fields of view in the NIR regime. PRIME's main goals are (1) To study planetary formation by measuring the frequency and mass function of planets. In particular, we compare results from the central Galactic bulge (GB), accessible only in the NIR by PRIME, with those from the outer GB by optical surveys. (2) To conduct concurrent observations with NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope. Due to the different lines of sight between the ground and space, we detect slight variations in light curves, known as ``Space-based parallax.\" This effect allows us to measure the mass of lens systems and their distance from the Earth. It is the only method to measure the mass of the free-floating planets down to Earth-mass. We begin the GB survey in February 2024 and analyzed images through June 1, 2025, identifying 486 microlensing candidates and over a thousand variable stars, including Mira variables, which are useful to study the Galactic structure. We issue real-time alerts for follow-up observations, supporting exoplanet searches, and the chemical evolution studies in the GB. During the off-bulge season, we conduct an all-sky grid survey and Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations of transients, including gravitational wave events, gamma-ray bursts, and other science.",

Here, we find that a population of these black holes would have dramatic implications for our understanding of their growth across cosmic time. We first show that the global black hole mass density at $z \\sim 5$ would be comparable to local values. This would not occur if these black holes occupy a small fraction of galaxies, though it would be expected if these black holes radiate at high efficiencies (requiring that the central engines of AGN spin rapidly). We then show that the individual detected $z \\sim 5$ black holes would remain overmassive compared to the local relation if they grow according to the average rates of state-of-the-art models. These systems must instead grow at least an order of magnitude more slowly than expected if they are to fall within the observed scatter of the local black hole mass-stellar mass relation. Such slow growth is surprising in comparison to other estimates of the radiative efficiency of AGN, especially because growth must be rapid at $z > 5$ in order to build up such massive black holes quickly. Finally, we highlight the challenges that overmassive black holes have on our understanding of the impact of quasar feedback on galaxies.",

        "abstract": "Exoplanets that reside close to their host stars, and therefore receive substantial amounts of X-ray and ultraviolet radiation, are prone to suffer from strong atmospheric escape. This can lead to the creation of an envelope of escaping gas along the planet's orbital trajectory, often referred to as a tail. When transiting in front of their host star, these tails can not only produce larger depths in the transit light curves, but also introduce significant asymmetries between ingress and egress. Using the publicly available software Harmonica, we present a method to model the light curves of transiting planets surrounded by extended envelopes of escaping gas, and subsequently infer the shape and size of the latter. We apply this method to the JWST NIRISS/SOSS observations of HAT-P-18b, which show pronounced helium tail features in its spectroscopic light curve of the metastable helium triplet at 10830 \\r{A}. Our model reveals that, in order to fit the observed light curve of HAT-P-18b, the planet must possess a trailing helium tail of $15.79^{+1.14}_{-1.05}$ planetary radii. We carry out injection-recovery tests to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. We demonstrate that, with sufficient precision, we would be able to fit a multi-layer envelope to the data, which would provide insight into the relative radial variations in the opacity profile.",

Among SNe IIn, a notable subset is the SNe 2009ip-like, which exhibit an initial, fainter peak attributed to stellar variability in the late evolutionary stages, followed by a brighter peak, interpreted as the SN explosion itself. We analyse the spectrophotometric evolution of SN 2024hpj, a SN IIn with signs of precursor activity. Comparing it with similar objects in the literature, we identify star-forming regions as their preferred environments, while a statistical analysis on the observed rate of SNe 2009ip-like indicates progenitor masses around 25 - 31 solar masses and lower. The diversity of spectrophotometric features within the sample suggests that variations in CSM mass and distribution influence the observed characteristics, indicating a shared progenitor scenario.",

        "abstract": "We review participatory science programs that have contributed to the understanding of star formation. The Milky Way Project (MWP), one of the earliest participatory science projects launched on the Zooniverse platform, produced the largest catalog of ``bubbles'' associated with feedback from hot young stars to date, and enabled the identification of a new class of compact star-forming regions (SFRs) known as ``yellowballs'' (YBs). The analysis of YBs through their infrared colors and catalog cross-matching led to discovering that YBs are compact photodissociation regions generated by intermediate- and high-mass young stellar objects embedded in clumps that range in mass from 10 - 10,000 solar masses and luminosity from 10 - 1,000,000 solar luminosities. The MIRION catalog, assembled from 6176 YBs identified by citizen scientists, increases the number of candidate intermediate-mass SFRs by nearly two orders of magnitude. Ongoing work utilizing data from the Spitzer, Herschel and WISE missions involves analyzing infrared color trends to predict physical properties and ages of YB environments. Methods include applying summary statistics to histograms and color-color plots as well as SED fitting. Students in introductory astronomy classes contribute toward continued efforts refining photometric measurements of YBs while learning fundamental concepts in astronomy through a classroom-based participatory science experience, the PERYSCOPE project. We also describe an initiative that engaged seminaries, family groups, and interfaith communities in a wide variety of science projects on the Zooniverse platform. This initiative produced important guidance on attracting audiences that are underserved, underrepresented, or apprehensive about science.",

        "abstract": "The James Webb Space Telescope recently uncovered a population of massive black holes (BHs) in the first billion years after the Big Bang. Among these high-redshift BH candidates, observations have identified a class of active galactic nuclei candidates, dubbed Little Red Dots (LRDs), with extraordinarily compact gas reservoirs and peculiar spectral features. LRDs clearly emerge at redshift z<8 and their abundance declines by z<5. Recent theoretical studies have explored the link between LRDs and the formation of heavy BH seeds in the early Universe, such as direct-collapse BHs (DCBHs). Here we present results from preliminary runs for the MELIORA cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, where we implement an accurate model for DCBH formation, accounting for the Lyman-Werner radiation field and mass-inflow rates in the target host haloes. We aim to test whether or not DCBH formation could lead to systems resembling those hypothesized for LRDs. We find that the population of newly formed DCBHs in the simulations exhibits a steep decline at z<6, akin to the emergence of LRDs, primarily driven by reduced inflows. The birth of DCBHs is associated with a significant gas compaction event, followed by a phase of intense luminosity in the 200 Myr after their birth, and subsequently by the formation of the first PopIII stars in these very haloes. If these DCBHs nurseries are associated with LRDs, then it could explain their weak emission from X-rays and hot dust.",

After summarizing the status and recurring problems of astrophysical code accelerations, we highlight how the field would benefit from portable, vendor-agnostic GPU portings. We then employ the DPEcho SYCL benchmark to compare raw performance and energy efficiency for heterogeneous hardware on a realistic application, with the goal of helping computational astrophysicists and HPC providers make informed decisions on the most suitable hardware. Aside from GPUs showing higher efficiency, we argue on the more informative nature of energy-aware KPIs, in that they convey the specific device performance in a data-driven way. We also present a convenient, flexible and cross-platform energy-measuring pipeline. Finally, we contextualize our results through measures with different compilers, presenting device (at the cores) versus node (at the plug) energy and comparing DPEcho with the High- Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the formation of stellar bars in 307 Milky Way-mass disc galaxies in the TNG50 cosmological simulation. Most bars form rapidly in dynamically cold discs shortly after the central stellar mass exceeds that of dark matter. In these cases, bar formation is consistent with secular instabilities driven by the disc's self-gravity, which organises stellar orbits into a coherent bar structure. However, around 25 per cent of barred galaxies are dark matter dominated at the time of bar formation, $t_{bar}$, and remain so thereafter. We trace the origin of these bars to tidal perturbations induced by passing satellites or mergers using a new metric, $S_{bar}$, quantifying the tidal field acting on the galaxy. At the time of bar formation, we find a negative correlation between $S_{bar}$ and the central stellar-to-dark matter mass fraction, indicating that more dark matter-dominated discs require stronger tides to trigger bar formation. These tidally induced bars are more likely to be transient than those that form secularly, although bar properties are otherwise similar. However, the host galaxies differ: secular bars arise in relatively compact discs, while tidal bars appear in extended discs whose properties resemble those of unbarred galaxies. Tidal perturbations can therefore induce bars in galaxies otherwise stable to secular formation, highlighting the dual role of the internal galactic structure and the external environment in bar formation.",

Since a dilute axion star has a stable mass limit only when self-interaction is considered, we include axion self-interaction effects in this paper, and specify the condition for bosenova in the QCD axion and temperature-independent axion-like particle parameter spaces. We find that self-interaction may dominate the mass growth of the axion star. For a minicluster with a large initial overdensity, bosenova occurs in a large fraction of axion parameter space. For the QCD axion, bosenova occurs within the age of the Universe for miniclusters with an initial overdensity $\\delta\\gtrsim 100$.",

We demonstrate that entropy injection from inflaton decay can significantly dilute the DM abundance, thereby relaxing the annihilation cross section required to reproduce the observed relic density and opening new regions of viable parameter space. We further analyze the complementarity between current and future direct detection experiments and charged lepton flavour violation (cLFV) searches in probing this scenario. Our results show that next-generation direct detection experiments such as DARWIN and XLZD, together with upcoming cLFV searches (in particular the future sensitivity of $\\mu \\rightarrow 3e$ experiments), will be capable of testing substantial regions of the parameter space, including those associated with low reheating temperatures.",

This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time (i.e., Cosmic Accretion) or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.",

Its binding to amorphous solid water (ASW) ice regulates both diffusion and desorption processes. Accurately characterizing the CO binding energy (BE) is essential for realistic astrochemical modeling.   Aims. We aim to derive a statistically robust and physically accurate distribution of CO BEs on ASW surfaces, and to evaluate its implications for laboratory temperature-programmed desorption experiments and interstellar chemistry, with a focus on protoplanetary disks.   Methods. We trained a machine-learned potential (MLP) on 8321 density functional theory (DFT) energies and gradients of CO interacting with differently-sized water clusters (22-60 water molecules). The DFT method was selected after extensive benchmark. With this potential we built realistic non-porous and porous ASW surfaces, and computed a BE distribution. We used symmetry-adapted perturbation theory to rationalize the interaction of CO on the different binding sites.   Results. We find that both ASW morphologies yield similar Gaussian-like BE distributions with mean values near 900 K. However, the nature of the binding interactions is rather different and critically depends on surface roughness and dangling-OH bonds. Simulated TPD curves reproduce experimental trends across several coverage regimes. From an astrochemical point of view, the application of the full BE distribution has a dramatic influence on the CO distribution in protoplanetary disks, leading to a broader CO snowline region, improving predictions of CO gas-ice partitioning, and suggesting an equally broader distribution of organics in these objects.",

Rigorous astrometric corrections are applied to Gaia DR3 parallaxes, proper motions, and photometry, ensuring accurate distance estimates through a Bayesian method suited to this stellar population's spatial distribution in the Milky Way.

This article reviews our current understanding of compact objects in globular clusters, discussing current observational evidence, ways these objects influence the dynamical evolution of their hosts, and future prospects.",

        "title": "The secular evolution of planetary nebula IC 418 and its implications for carbon star formation",
        "abstract": "The rate of stellar evolution can rarely be measured in real time. The fastest evolution (excluding event-driven evolution), where stars may evolve measurably over decades, is during the post-AGB phase. In this paper we provide direct evidence for such a case. A secular, linear, factor of ~2.5 increase is found in the strength of the [O III] lines relative to H-beta over an 130 year period in the young, well-known, low excitation planetary nebula IC 418. The increase is caused by the rising temperature of the central star. We use photo-ionization models to derive a model dependent heating rate for the central star in the range 15-42 K\\/yr. These derived heating rates are very sensitive to the stellar mass, and yield a central-star mass of 0.560-0.583 solar masses. Initial-final mass relations based on the Miller-Bertolami models give a progenitor main-sequence mass of 1.25-1.55 solar masses. IC 418 is a carbon rich planetary nebula and its central star, HD 35914, has evolved from an AGB carbon star. This result shows that carbon star formation at solar metallicity extends to these low masses. This is lower than commonly assumed and suggests that post-AGB evolution may be slower than recent post-AGB models predict.",

        "abstract": "Over the past 15 years, the evidence has clearly demonstrated that massive black hole (MBH) binary merger timescales depend strongly on the structural and kinematic properties of their host galaxy. Stellar density, gas content, shape and kinematics all play a role, combining in non-linear ways to effect the evolution of the binary. The binary properties themselves, such as eccentricity, mass ratio, and orbital plane, all matter as well. This makes it nontrivial to estimate accurate cosmological MBH binary merger rates, or to generate merger rate ranges that reflect the distribution of galaxy hosts and orbits. Using an extensive set of high-resolution direct N-body simulations in which the shape, structure, and kinematics of each galaxy host are directly informed by observations, we map out MBH binary merger timescales over a range of galaxy hosts and MBH binary orbits. This yields a convenient set of scaling relations to determine MBH binary merger timescales -- and the range of merger timescales -- as functions of basic observables. Such scaling relations can be readily employed as a subgrid model in cosmological or semi-analytic studies, for example, to model event rates for LISA or pulsar timing.",

This work investigates the directional emission of neutrinos from Kerr-Newman PBHs undergoing Hawking evaporation, accounting for the combined effects of spin, motion, and electric charge. Rotation induces anisotropic fluxes through axisymmetric geometry and spin-dependent greybody factors, while relativistic motion leads to pronounced Doppler beaming along the direction of travel. Electric charge modifies the thermodynamic evolution and suppresses the emission of like-charged particles, altering the overall spectrum and burst duration. The resulting neutrino flux exhibits rich angular structure, energy dependence, and time profiles that vary with PBH parameters. These directional signatures enhance the prospects for detection at current and future neutrino observatories, and offer new multi-messenger probes of PBH populations in the early universe.",

        "abstract": "Variability detected in galaxies is usually attributed to their active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While all AGNs are intrinsically variable, the classic AGN unification model predicts that type~2 AGNs rarely vary because their engines are obstructed by dust tori. Previous UV-to-near-IR variability studies largely support this expectation. Here, we present a variability study by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that reveals a more subtle picture. Using NIRCam imaging data from three surveys over $\\sim$140~arcmin$^2$ in the COSMOS field, we found 117 galaxies with $\\geq 4$$\\sigma$ variability in the F356W band across a $\\sim$2-year baseline. Cross-matching with existing JWST spectroscopic data in this area, we identified five of them at $z=0.19$--3.69, which were all coincidentally observed by a NIRSpec program almost contemporaneously with the last imaging epoch. One additional variable was identified at $z=0.90$ using the archival Keck telescope data. These six objects form our spectroscopic subsample. Interestingly, two reside in close-pair environments, while two others form a close pair themselves. Most of their light curves can hardly be explained by nuclear transients, and AGN variability is a more plausible cause. However, among these six objects, (1) only one shows broad permitted lines ($\\Delta v > 1000$~km~s$^{-1}$) indicative of a type~1 AGN; (2) two show narrow permitted lines consistent with type~2 AGNs, with another one likely type~2 based on the host galaxy properties; and (3) two others, which form a pair, show no emission lines. Our results add more challenges to the unification model.",

We explore potential correlation between mass and mass ratio with phenomenological population models where the minimum mass of the smaller (secondary) black hole can change with the mass of the bigger (primary) black hole. We use binary black hole signals from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog with and without the relatively extreme mass-ratio GW190814. When excluding GW190814, models with a variable minimum mass are disfavoured compared to one with a constant minimum mass, with log Bayes factors of -2.49 to -0.98, indicating that the biggest black holes can merge with the smallest. When including GW190814, a parabola model that allows the minimum mass to decrease with increasing primary mass is favoured over a constant minimum-mass model with a log Bayes factor of 4.44. When allowing the minimum mass to decrease, the overall population distributions remain similar whether or not GW190814 is included. This shows that with added model flexibility, we can reconcile potential outlier observations within our population. These investigations motivate further explorations of correlations between mass ratio and component masses in order to understand how evolutionary processes may leave an imprint on these distributions.",

J164653.72+243942.2 (z ~ 3.04) shows variable CIV1548,1551 absorption at speeds larger than 0.1c, accompanied by SiIV, NV and Lya, and disappearing absorption at lower speeds. We perform absorption measurements using the Apparent Optical Depth method and SimBAL. We find the absorption to be very broad ({\\Delta}v ~35,100 km/s in the first epoch and ~13,000 km/s in the second one) and fast (vmax ~ -50,200 km/s and -49,000 km/s, respectively).

We find that J164653.72+243942.2 is not an outlier among EHVO quasars in regard to its physical properties. While its column density is lower than typical BAL values, its higher outflow velocities drive most of the mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity.

Similar to Type Ia Supernovae, GRBs with a common physical origin can be used as standardizable candles for cosmological studies. However, observational gaps in GRB light curves introduce significant uncertainties in plateau parameter estimation, thereby affecting cosmological constraints. In this work, we employ a stochastic reconstruction technique to reconstruct the X-ray afterglow LCs for 35 GRB samples exhibiting plateau features, generating 50 simulated data points for each LC. Using the reconstructed LCs, we calibrate three luminosity correlations: the $L_0$-$t_b$, $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{p,i}$, and $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{\\gamma,\\mathrm{iso}}$ relation, which are then applied to constrain both flat and non-flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological models. The main results include: (i) the $L_0$-$t_b$ relation yields a slope $b \\approx -1$, supporting a constant magnetar energy injection rate; (ii) light curve reconstruction has limited impact on cosmological parameter constraints; (iii) for the flat $\\Lambda$CDM model constrained by the $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{p,i}$ relation, the precision of $\\Omega_m$ improves by 6.25\\%; For the non-flat $\\Lambda$CDM model constrained by the $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{p,i}$ relation, the precision of $\\Omega_\\Lambda$ improves by 1.01\\%.

These unveil small-scale radio features in the system and allow a direct comparison with the arcsecond-resolution X-ray images. We find that the radio emission is composed of a complex filamentary structure. In particular, there is a bar-like feature across the central pulsar B1509-58 in the inner PWN, and the radio sheath wrapping around the pulsar also appears to be made up of filaments. Some prominent X-ray features are not detected in radio, including the one-sided jet in the south and the finger-like structures in the north. These indicates turn over of the particle distribution at low energies in these regions. For RCW 89, the radio emission well coincides with both the X-ray knots and the H{\\alpha} filaments.

Our images reveal, for the first time, two distinct substructures: a compact, crescent-shaped inner arc within 10 au of the star, and a narrow outer ring at 30 au. The inner arc is strongly elongated and casts a shadow observed in the VLT/SPHERE near-infrared scattered light. The outer ring exhibits a radial width comparable to the local pressure scale height, consistent with moderately efficient dust trapping. Geometric and thermal analysis of the disk surface, based on combined ALMA and SPHERE data, indicates that the disk is moderately flared with an average disk temperature consistent with that of classical T Tauri disks. The observed substructures suggest dynamical perturbations-plausibly induced by a massive companion-that may modulate accretion rates through gravitational interaction with the inner arc. These findings provide morphological evidence linking disk substructure to episodic accretion in the structurally mature disk.",

Here, we present a new possibility of breaking the degeneracy without invoking early Universe priors on $\\Omega_\\mathrm{b}$. Assuming some FRBs originate in compact object mergers, the combination of dispersion and luminosity distance from the gravitational wave (GW) can be used to measure $\\Omega_\\mathrm{b}h^2f_\\mathrm{d}$ (where $h$ is the dimensionless Hubble constant). We show that this measurement can be combined with the abundant FRBs that have a redshift measurement. This combination breaks the degeneracy with the Hubble constant. We develop a Bayesian framework and forecast that third-generation GW detectors are required to obtain meaningful constraints. We forecast that one year of Einstein Telescope operations can constrain $H_0$ to $\\pm 6\\,\\mathrm{km}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\\Omega_\\mathrm{b}h^2f_\\mathrm{d}$ to $^{+0.0015}_{-0.0016}$ (68$\\,\\%$ credible interval). The method can also be used with luminosity distances obtained through other means than GWs.",

        "abstract": "We present optical integral-field spectroscopic data of ten nearby ($0.02\\leq z \\leq 0.05$) Seyfert 1 galaxies taken with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). We map the spatially resolved kinematics of the [O III] gas and stars, and investigate the alignments between their global kinematic position angles (PA). Large-scale gas motions are primarily dominated by rotation, and are kinematically aligned with the stars ($\\Delta\\text{PA}\\leq 30$ deg). However, eight galaxies exhibit non-rotational kinematic signatures (e.g., kinematic twists, possible outflows) in their ionized gas velocity fields near the nucleus. We compare aperture-wide measurements of the gas and stellar velocity dispersions ($\\sigma_{\\text{gas}}$ and $\\sigma_\\star$) to test the use of the width of the [O III] line core as a surrogate for $\\sigma_\\star$. Direct comparisons between $\\sigma_{\\text{gas}}$ and $\\sigma_\\star$ show that $\\sigma_{\\text{gas}}$ tends to underestimate $\\sigma_\\star$, and thus is not a reliable tracer of $\\sigma_\\star$ for our selected galaxies. We measure the extent of the narrow-line region (NLR) using several definitions, resulting in sizes of $\\sim0.1$-$10$ kpc. For a given [O III] luminosity, our NLR sizes derived from the [O III]/H$\\beta$ flux ratio or an [O III] isophotal radius are an order of magnitude larger than those measured from past imaging data.",

Radio detection threshold, influenced by natural and anthropogenic radio background, can be reduced through various techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are an effective way to lower the threshold. We developed two CNNs: a classifier to distinguish radio signal waveforms from background noise and a denoiser to clean contaminated radio signals. Following the training and testing phases, we applied the networks to air-shower data triggered by scintillation detectors of the prototype station for the enhancement of IceTop, IceCube's surface array at the South Pole. Over a four-month period, we identified 554 cosmic-ray events in coincidence with IceTop, approximately five times more compared to a reference method based on a cut on the signal-to-noise ratio. Comparisons with IceTop measurements of the same air showers confirmed that the CNNs reliably identified cosmic-ray radio pulses and outperformed the reference method. Additionally, we find that CNNs reduce the false-positive rate of air-shower candidates and effectively denoise radio waveforms, thereby improving the accuracy of the power and arrival time reconstruction of radio pulses.",

Most earlier imaging-spectroscopic studies have relied on slit-based spectrometers, which offer high spectral resolution but are limited in spatiotemporal coverage and temperature diagnostics. In contrast, slitless spectrographs like the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS) produce overlapping spatial-spectral data (overlappograms) to enable wide-field imaging spectroscopy with broader temperature coverage. However, extracting elemental abundances from overlappogram data remains inherently challenging due to spatial and spectral confusion.

        "abstract": "The solar disk is a continuous source of GeV--TeV gamma rays. The emission is thought to originate from hadronic Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) interacting with the gas in the photosphere and uppermost convection zone after being reflected by solar magnetic fields. Despite this general understanding, existing theoretical models have yet to match observational data. At the photosphere and the uppermost convection zone, granular convection drives a multi-scale magnetic field, forming a larger-scale filamentary structure while also generating turbulence-scale Alfv\\'{e}n wave turbulence. Here, we demonstrate that the larger-scale filamentary field shapes the overall gamma-ray emission spectrum, and the Alfv\\'{e}n wave turbulence is critical for further suppressing the gamma-ray emission spectrum below $\\sim 100$~GeV. For a standard Alfv\\'{e}n wave turbulence level, our model's predicted spectrum slope from 1~GeV to 1~TeV is in excellent agreement with observations from Fermi-LAT and HAWC, an important achievement. The predicted absolute flux is a factor of 2--5 lower than the observed data; we outline future directions to resolve this discrepancy. The key contribution of our work is providing a new theoretical framework for using solar disk gamma-ray observations to probe hadronic GCR transport in the lower solar atmosphere.",

        "abstract": "Eccentric compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are expected to be observed in current and future gravitational-wave (GW) detector networks. However, it has been recently pointed out that a number of other physical and beyond-GR effects, could imitate, or be mimicked by, eccentric CBCs. In this work, we propose a conceptually simple but powerful method to directly confirm or reject the eccentric hypothesis, without needing to compare the hypothesis with the plethora of other possible hypotheses. The key idea is that while spurious non-zero values of eccentricity, at some reference frequency, could be acquired when a non-eccentric CBC with additional physical/beyond-GR effects is recovered with an eccentric CBC waveform model, the {\\it evolution} of eccentricity with frequency will in general not be mimicked. We accordingly formulate an eccentricity evolution consistency test (EECT). The method compares the eccentricity recovered at some low frequency value (e.g, $10$ Hz), evolved to higher frequencies assuming GR, with eccentricities recovered at those same higher frequencies. Discrepancy between the two eccentricities at any reference frequency would violate EECT and indicate the presence of a mimicker. As a proof of concept, assuming a few eccentric CBC systems, quasi-circular CBCs with additional physics mimicking eccentricity, and an O4-like three-detector-network configuration, we demonstrate that our proposed method is indeed able to reject mimickers at $\\geq 68\\%$ confidence, while ensuring that truly eccentric CBCs satisfy EECT.",

        "abstract": "Directly imaging exoplanets is a formidable challenge due to extreme contrast ratios and quasi-static speckle noise, motivating the exploration of advanced post-processing methods. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promise, their inherent limitations in capturing long-range dependencies in image sequences hinder their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that combines a CNN feature extractor with a Transformer encoder to leverage temporal information, modeling the signature of a planet's coherent motion across an observation sequence. We first validated the model on a purely synthetic dataset, where it demonstrated excellent performance. While the final metrics varied slightly between training runs, our reported trial achieved 100.0% accuracy, a 100.0% F1-score, and a position accuracy of 0.72 pixels, showing strong results on this specific test case in comparison to traditional methods like median subtraction and PCA-KLIP. To assess its viability on realistic data, we retrained the model on a semi-synthetic dataset created by injecting planet signals into actual high-contrast imaging observations of the TW Hya protoplanetary disk from JWST. The model successfully identified the injected signals with high confidence, confirming its ability to function amidst complex, correlated noise and bright disk features. This work serves as a successful proof-of-concept, demonstrating that a CNN-Transformer architecture holds significant promise as a fast, accurate, and automated method for exoplanet detection in the large datasets expected from current and future high-contrast imaging instruments.",

Its very active surface has hot spots produced by volcanic eruptions popping up at seemingly random locations and times. Characterizing the complex surface of Io requires the highest angular resolution available. This work presents the analysis of Aperture Masking Interferometric observations (at 4.3 um) of Io taken with the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. These are the first space-based infrared interferometric observations of a Solar System body ever taken. For complex extended objects like Io, the traditional visibility extraction algorithms from interferograms suffer from limitations. Here, new deconvolution methods based on Neural Networks allowed us to obtain reliable images from which a detailed analysis of the volcanically active surface of this moon was performed. Our study characterizes the loci and brightness of several unresolved volcanoes on the surface of Io, as well as the extended emission observed. We identified the brightest eruption (I_4.3um = 33 +/- 4.3 GW/um), referred to as V1, within an area to the North-East of Seth Patera (129.4 +/- 0.8 deg. W. Longitude, 1.5 +/- 0.7 deg. S. Latitude). Its projected speed (V_T = 86 +/- 34 m/s) is consistent with the rotational speed of Io. Additionally, six fainter volcanoes were identified and characterized. Complementary ground-based images, taken with the Keck II telescope, allowed us to benchmark the deconvolved Aperture Masking Interferometric images, showing consistency. Finally, we highlight the importance of characterizing Io's surface with long-term monitoring at high-angular resolution.",

Implementation of these free-free radiation fields in solving the rate equations shows that the free-free radiation fields of some hyper-compact HII regions are ineffective to invert the 4.8 GHz transition. Investigation of the variation of the inversion of the 4.8 GHz and 14.5 GHz transitions with radial distance revealed that there are regions where only the 4.8 GHz transition is inverted. It is also shown that the projection of the masing region toward the edge of a hyper-compact may explain the non-detection of 14.5 GHz masers. The attenuation of the 4.8 GHz and 14.5 GHz masers in the molecular envelope is investigated. It is found that attenuation can be significant.

        "abstract": "To better distinguish the nature of $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, it is necessary to separate the effects of expansion and the growth of structure. The growth index $\\gamma$ was identified as the single parameter that characterizes the growth of density fluctuations independently of the effects of cosmic expansion. Analyses performed with various cosmological datasets indicate that the growth index has to be larger than its theoretically predicted value in the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Cosmological models based on $f(R)$ gravity theories have scale-dependent growth indices, whose values are even more at odds with the growth rate data. In this work, we evaluate the growth index in the $\\gamma\\delta$CDM model both theoretically and numerically. Although based on $f(R)$ gravity theory, we show through several analyses with different combinations of datasets that the growth index and growth rate in the $\\gamma\\delta$CDM model behave similarly to the $\\Lambda$CDM and the $\\omega$CDM models. When faced with cosmological data, we also demonstrate that the $\\gamma\\delta$CDM model fits better than the $\\Lambda$CDM and the $\\omega$CDM models.",

However, several lines of the CLASP2/2.1 spectral region with significant circular polarization signals had remained unexplored. After identifying two Ni I (279.95 and 280.59 nm), one Mn II (280.62 nm), and one Fe I (280.53 nm) lines, here we apply the Weak Field Approximation (WFA) to the spectropolarimetric observations of active region plages by CLASP2 and CLASP2.1.

Unlike previous databases, PTD II preserves the critical raw data segments of each detected pulse, enabling detailed analyses of emission physics while maintaining a compact size of only 1.5 GB. The database employs a sqlite3 structure organising pulsar metadata, observation files, and pulse events with their raw data stored in binary format. We provide processing tools for extracting and analysing single-pulse data, enabling fluence fitting and statistical analysis. Our pulsars exhibit diverse fluence distributions, such as log-normal, Gaussian, and unimodal. Temporal analyses reveal significant evolution in emission characteristics of several pulsars, including event rate variations spanning two orders of magnitude in PSR J1602-5100 and PSR J0942-5552. Beyond supporting fundamental pulsar emission studies, the database serves as a valuable training resource for developing new single-pulse detection algorithms in the presence of radio frequency interference.",

The Australia Telescope Compact Array automatically triggered a 9-hour observation of GRB 231117A at 5.5 and 9 GHz following its detection by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory just 1.3 hours post-burst. Splitting this observation into 1-hour time bins, the early radio afterglow exhibited flaring, scintillating and plateau phases. The scintillation allowed us to place the earliest upper limit ($<10$ hours) on the size of a GRB blast wave to date, constraining it to $35$ to $\\Gamma>5$ between $\\sim0.1$ and $1$ day. These results demonstrate the importance of rapid and sensitive radio follow-up of GRBs for exploring their central engines and outflow behaviour.",

Prompt release of data products such as the sky localization, false alarm rate (FAR), and $p_\\mathrm{astro}$ values allow astronomers to make informed decisions on which candidate gravitational-wave events merit target of opportunity (ToO) follow-up. However, false alarms, often referred to as \"glitches\", where a gravitational-wave candidate, or trigger, is the result of terrestrial noise, are an inherent part of gravitational-wave searches. In addition, with the presence of multiple gravitational-wave searches, different searches may have varying assessments of the significance of a given trigger. As a complement to quantities such as $p_\\mathrm{astro}$, we provide a Machine Learning (ML) based approach to determining whether candidate events are astrophysical or terrestrial in nature, specifically a classifier that utilizes information provided by multiple low-latency search pipelines in its feature space. This classifier has a performance an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.96 and accuracy of 0.90 on the Mock Data Challenge training set and an AUC of 0.93 and accuracy of 0.86 on events from the Advanced LIGO (aLIGO)'s and Advanced Virgo (AdVirgo)'s third observing run (O3).",

Recent observations have revealed that small-scale swirls are ubiquitous in the photosphere and chromosphere, suggesting that they may play a significant role in transferring magnetic energy into the corona. However, the overall contribution of swirls to the total magnetic energy supply and subsequent coronal heating remains uncertain. To address this, we perform statistical analyses of simulated swirls using a three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation extending from the convection zone to the corona in the quiet Sun. Our results reveal that swirls account for approximately half of the total magnetic energy. Furthermore, they strongly suggest that swirls can trigger coronal heating events through magnetic reconnection. The occurrence frequency of these events follows a power-law-like distribution, consistent with observations of coronal heating signatures known as \"nanoflares\", indicating that swirls are promising candidates as their drivers.",

Here we initiate the investigation on the spectral split of monochromatic signals caused by detector's heliocentric motion in space and show the annual modulation can induce distinct structures in the spectral harmonics for GWs and ULDM, which would enable to clearly identify the nature of the signal. We show the physical parameters can be inferred with high precision using the Fisher matrix formalism.

We use the lattice simulations to investigate the impact of a spectator scalar field with mass generation on the dynamics of first-order phase transitions and the generation of gravitational waves. In addition to the well-known friction effects, we identify a novel effect that significantly enhances the strength of first-order phase transitions. The amplitude of the mass-acquiring field is highly suppressed in the true vacuum bubbles, resulting in additional release of vacuum energy that concentrate on the bubble walls. We also establish an analytical method to explain our numerical results.",

        "abstract": "We extended the once-in-a-lifetime encounter (OILE) model to stochastic interactions among neutrinos. As in the original OILE model, the new model reproduces the mean-field behavior of a dense neutrino gas for time $t\\lesssim (\\mu\\gamma)^{-1}$, where $\\mu$ measures the strength of the mean-field neutrino self-interaction potential and is proportional to the neutrino density, and the dimensionless \"impact parameter\" $\\gamma$ is a measure of the change in the flavor quantum state of a neutrino during interaction with another neutrino when the wave packets of the two neutrinos overlap. As in the mean-field case, the OILE model with random neutrino velocities experiences kinetic flavor decoherence as the flavor quantum states of the neutrinos diverge from each other. Unlike the mean-field case, however, the OILE model has a \"collision term\" due to the quantum entanglement among neutrinos. For $\\gamma\\ll1$, this incoherent effect can drive the neutrinos into a quasi-steady state that is similar to the collective precession mode in a homogeneous and isotropic neutrino gas in the mean-field approximation. Subsequently, the collision term drives the neutrino gas adiabatically through different quasi-steady states and eventually to flavor equilibration. This process is an example of miscidynamic flavor evolution, with the mixing equilibria being the quasi-steady precession states.",

        "abstract": "Relativistic magnetic reconnection has been proposed as an important nonthermal particle acceleration (NTPA) mechanism that generates power-law spectra and high-energy emissions. Power-law particle spectra are in general characterized by three parameters: the power-law index, the high-energy cutoff, and the low-energy cutoff (i.e., the injection energy). Particle injection into the nonthermal power law, despite also being a critical step in the NTPA chain, has received considerably less attention than the subsequent acceleration to high energies. Open questions on particle injection that are important for both physical understanding and astronomical observations include how the upstream magnetization~$\\sigma$ influences the injection energy and the contributions of the known injection mechanisms (i.e., direct acceleration by the reconnection electric field, Fermi kicks, and pickup acceleration) to the injected particle population. Using fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we uncover these relationships by systematically measuring the injection energy and calculating the contributions of each acceleration mechanism to the total injected particle population. We also present a theoretical model to explain these results. Additionally, we compare 2D and 3D simulations to assess the impact of the flux-rope kink and drift-kink instability on particle injection. We conclude with comparisons to previous work and outlook for future work.",

This parametrization allows for a time-dependent expansion history consistent with the non-linear Galileon field equations. To constrain the model parameters, we perform a MCMC analysis using $46$ Hubble parameter measurements, DESI DR2 BAO data and $1701$ Pantheon+ datasets. The best fit values obtained are $H_0 = 67.7043^{+1.4354}_{-1.4102}$ km/s/Mpc, $\\Omega_{m0} = 0.2668^{+0.0212}_{-0.0217}$, $\\omega_0 = -0.8827^{+0.1076}_{-0.0967}$ and $\\omega_a = 0.0011^{+0.0660}_{-0.0622}$.

In this work, we analyse public interferometric radio maps of AO 0235+164 at 15 and 43 GHz, using the Cross Entropy global optimisation technique to determine the structural parameters of its jet components. We identified 36 kinematically distinct jet components across all sky quadrants, indicating a highly relativistic parsec-scale jet with a minimum Lorentz factor of 34 +/- 7 and a maximum viewing angle of 37 +/- 8 degree. The temporal evolution of these jet components was modelled as a relativistic jet under a constant precession rate. The optimal clockwise precession model has a precession period of 8.4 +\\- 0.2 years, consistent with the 8.13-year periodicity previously detected in optical light curves, besides providing a time-variable Doppler boosting factor correlated with the most intense flares at gamma-ray energies. For the counter-clockwise precession, a period of 6.0 +\\- 0.1 years is found, compatible with the 5-6 year periodicities detected at radio and optical wavelengths. It is plausible that a supermassive black hole binary system in the nucleus of AO 0235+164 drives the parsec-scale jet precession and induces nodding motions consistent with short-term continuum periodicities. Nonetheless, alternative scenarios (e.g., intrinsic curved jet, warped accretion disc instabilities, Lense-Thirring/Bardeen-Petterson effects, dual jets) cannot be ruled out as causes or optional explanations for the precession.",

Due to the intrinsic nature of this quantity, $\\dot{P}$ analysis has been used to probe fundamental physics, such as constraining the mass of hypothetical axion particles. However, most white dwarfs are expected to host planets that could induce an external source of period change, caused by the light travel time variations from reflex motion about the system barycenter. Assuming a plausible distribution of planets that could orbit white dwarf stars, we quantify the amount of reflex motion expected from undiscovered planets as an important source of extrinsic error in $\\dot{P}$ analyses. While the median error from reflex motion is $\\sim10^{-15}$ ss$^{-1}$ (similar to the secular $\\dot{P}$ rates expected for cool DAV pulsators), individual close-in planets could cause $\\dot{P}$ errors as large as $10^{-11}$ ss$^{-1}$",

The magnetic field strength measurement via the Zeeman effect of OH maser emission is well established, but that of the methanol maser emission is still under debate because of its complex hyperfine structure. We aim to identify the dominating hyperfine transition of the Class II methanol maser emission by comparing the magnetic field strength measured with the excited OH maser emission and the Zeeman splitting of the methanol maser emission. We used quasi-simultaneous EVN observations of the two maser emissions at 6.035 GHz ex-OH and 6.668 GHz methanol toward two well-known high-mass young stellar objects: ON 1 and W75N. The observations were performed in full polarimetric mode and in phase-referencing mode to couple the maser features of the two maser emissions in each source. We detected linearly and circularly polarized emission in both maser transitions and HMYSOs. Specifically, we measured the magnetic field strength in twelve and five ex-OH maser features toward ON1 and W75N, respectively, and the Zeeman splitting of the methanol maser spectra in one and three maser features toward ON 1 and W75N, respectively. We determined that the two maser emissions likely probe the same magnetic field but at different densities. Indeed, a direct comparison of the magnetic field strength and the Zeeman splitting as measured with the ex-OH and methanol maser spots, respectively, provided values of the Zeeman splitting coefficient for the 6.7 GHz maser that do not match any of the table values present in the literature. We are not able to uniquely identify the dominating hyperfine transition; however, through density considerations, we can narrow the choice down to three hyperfine transitions: 3->4, 6->7A, and 7->8.",

While complex field WFS -- those that estimate the electric field phase and amplitude through interference or diffraction effects -- can achieve extraordinary sensitivity compared to existing devices, they typically reconstruct the wrapped phase of the measured wavefront, which must then be unwrapped for correction by continuous-surface deformable mirrors (DM). Another requirement is that the phase function must be unwrapped within 1 millisecond or faster for real-time AO operations. Using simulations of atmospheric turbulence that follow a Kolmogorov spectrum, we study four prevalent and mature phase unwrapping methods: Fast2D, Zernike Gradient (Zernike), Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), and Least Squares Principle Value (LSPV). In this paper, we examine the strengths and limitations of each method.

By studying the multiwavelength polarimetric behaviour of high synchrotron peaked (HSP) and low synchrotron peaked (LSP) blazars, we aim to explore differences in their emission mechanisms and magnetic field structure in the acceleration region. In this study, we take advantage of several X-ray polarisation observations of HSP by the IXPE, including four new observations of Mrk 501, and optical polarisation observations of LSP from RoboPol and many others. We find that the polarisation degree (PD) distribution of HSP in X-rays is systematically higher than in optical and mm-radio wavelengths, as reported in previous IXPE publications. The distribution of the X-ray electric vector position angles (PA) is centered around the jet axis with most of the observations consistent with zero difference within uncertainties. In fact, the distribution of the offset of the PA from the jet axis is consistent between the LSP and HSP populations (with PA measured in optical for the first, X-ray for the latter), suggesting a common magnetic field structure close to the acceleration region, in strong support of the emerging energy stratified picture of particle acceleration followed by energy loss in blazar jets.",

There's yet another daunting problem generic to any inflationary model, and not particular to the Power Law Inflation, is the issue of classicalization of the primordial quantum perturbation. This issue is often treated as an isolated problem primarily because decoherence is often invoked to tackle such problems and decoherence, in principle, doesn't leaves any observational imprints. However, that's not the case if one invokes the collapse models of quantum mechanics to resolve such a problem, because the collapse models do modify the Schr\\\"{o}dinger evolution of the quantum system and the modified dynamics is bound to leave imprints. We show that collapsed modified Power Law Inflation can indeed circumvent the issue with observations and can be made compatible with all the current data coming from {\\it Planck}, {\\it ACT}, DESI and BAO while resolving the classicalization issue associated with the quantum primordial fluctuations. Such an inflationary model also produces a more red-tilted tensor spectrum and no running for both the scalar and tensor spectral indices, which can be a litmus test for this model.",

        "abstract": "AXIS, a Probe mission concept now in a Phase A study, will provide transformative studies of high-energy astrophysical phenomena thanks to its high-resolution X-ray spectral imaging. These capabilities are enabled by improvements to the mirror design that greatly increase the X-ray throughput per unit mass; and to the detector system, which operates more than an order of magnitude faster than heritage instruments while maintaining excellent spectral performance. We present updates to the design of the AXIS High-Speed Camera, a collaborative effort by MIT, Stanford University, the Pennsylvania State University, and the Southwest Research Institute. The camera employs large-format MIT Lincoln Laboratory CCDs that feature multiple high-speed, low-noise output amplifiers and an advanced single-layer polysilicon gate structure for fast, low-power clock transfers. A first lot of prototype CCID100 CCDs has completed fabrication and will soon begin X-ray performance testing. The CCDs are paired with high-speed, low-noise ASIC readout chips designed by Stanford to provide better performance than conventional discrete solutions at a fraction of the power consumption and footprint. Complementary Front-End Electronics employ state-of-the-art digital video waveform capture and advanced signal processing to further deliver low noise at high speed. The Back-End Electronics provide high-speed identification of candidate X-ray events and transient monitoring that relays fast alerts of changing sources to the community. We highlight updates to our parallel X-ray performance test facilities at MIT and Stanford, and review the current performance of the CCD and ASIC technology from testing of prototype devices. These measurements achieve excellent spectral response at the required readout rate, demonstrating that we will meet mission requirements and enable AXIS to achieve world-class science.",

        "abstract": "The first generation of Single electron Sensitive Read Out (SiSeRO) amplifiers, employed as on-chip charge detectors for charge-coupled devices (CCDs) have demonstrated excellent noise and spectral performance: a responsivity of around 800 pA per electron, an equivalent noise charge (ENC) of 3.2 electrons root mean square (RMS), and a full width half maximum (FWHM) energy resolution of 130 eV at 5.9 keV for a readout speed of 625 Kpixel/s. Repetitive Non Destructive Readout (RNDR) has also been demonstrated with these devices, achieving an improved ENC performance of 0.36 electrons RMS after 200 RNDR cycles. In order to mature this technology further, Stanford University, in collaboration with MIT Kavli Institute and MIT Lincoln Laboratory, are developing new SiSeRO detectors with improved geometries that should enable greater responsivity and improved noise performance. These include CCD devices employing arrays of SiSeRO amplifiers to optimize high speed, low noise RNDR readout and a proof-of-concept SiSeRO active pixel sensor (APS). To read out these devices, our team has developed a compact, 8-channel, fast, low noise, low power application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) denoted the Multi-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC) that includes an experimental drain current readout mode intended for SiSeRO devices. In this paper, we present results from the first tests of SiSeRO CCD devices operating with MCRC readout, and our designs for next generation SiSeRO devices.",

In this study, we analyze continuous GWs from the SMBHB candidate 3C 66B, modeling the GWB as a common uncorrelated red noise. Using Bayesian methods, we perform targeted searches across two PTA data sets: Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves 15 years data set and the European Pulsar Timing Array DR2 full data set. We find no evidence of such signal in both data sets and then place upper limits on the amplitude of the signal and the chirp mass of the source. Additionally, we evaluate the case of a GWB characterized by Hellings-Downs correlations using a likelihood reweighting method, which consistently reconfirms the conclusion of non-detection.",

Roman's planetary defense capabilities complement those of two wide-field survey missions: the now operational ground-based Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the upcoming space-based NEO Surveyor. Rubin, observing in visible light, will discover over 100,000 NEOs. NEO Surveyor, observing in the mid-infrared where NEO thermal emission peaks, will detect 200,000-300,000 NEOs, some as small as ~20 meters in diameter. With investment in developing the pipeline infrastructure required to extract information from moving target streaks, Roman will be able to observe NEOs down to the smallest sizes in order to improve our measurements of NEO orbits by 2-3 orders of magnitude, enable accurate diameter and albedo estimates in conjunction with NEO Surveyor, and reveal the spectral types and bulk compositions of the smallest NEOs. Together, these three US-led facilities will operate across the electromagnetic spectrum to form a comprehensive planetary defense network.",

On Earth, they play critical roles in sustaining microbial life within soils, permafrost, and groundwater environments and their availability shape microbial community compositions, activity, and adaptability to changes in environmental conditions, enabling communities to persist over millennial timescales. The counterpart to aqueous-soluble organics is the insoluble organic matter pool that makes up the largest portion of organic matter in natural samples and includes most types of organic signatures indicative of biological processes. Employing a range of sample preparation, molecular separation, detection, and imaging techniques enables the characterization of both labile (i.e., soluble and reactive) and recalcitrant (i.e., insoluble, non-reactive; include macromolecules) organic pools. Multiple orthogonal analytical modalities strengthen interpretations of signatures that we associate with biology as we know it and don't know it, by constraining possible abiotic sources, validating measurements across distinct techniques, and ensuring flexibility to interrogate diverse organic chemistries encountered in Martian subsurface environments. This holistic triage approach aligns with the priorities articulated in the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group's Search for Life -Science Analysis Group (SFL-SAG) Charter for a medium-class Mars mission focused on extant life detection.",

        "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) typically exhibit a three-component structure in white-light (WL) coronagraphs. Utilizing the seamless observations of the inner corona ($\\le$ 3 R$_\\odot$), we have revealed the early evolution of the cavity and core of a CME starting at $\\sim$18:20 UT on 2014 October 14. The CME originates from a hot channel (HC), which appears as the bright core and compresses the cavity in WL images. Specifically, most of the dark cavity in WL is filled by bright loop-like structures in 174 \\AA. The differential emission measure (DEM) analysis indicates that the electron temperature decreases from the core ($\\sim$13.4 MK) to the cavity ($\\sim$1.35 MK), and the CME cavity is significantly cooler than that enshrouding a prominence ($\\ge$ 2 MK). The effective temperature of the cavity increases over time in general, probably due to the compression by the HC expansion. The evolution of the CME bright core includes slow-rise, fast-rise (up to $\\sim$330 km s$^{-1}$), and residual-acceleration phases. The cavity exhibits an evolution similar to the core but lags by $\\sim$4 minutes, with a lower speed peaking at $\\sim$220 km s$^{-1}$. Moreover, the 2D radial speed distribution exhibits the highest speeds at the core apex. The kinematical results further confirm the compression of the cavity. The present event supports the new explanation of the CME structures, i.e., the magnetic flux rope (MFR), which is proxied by the HC, is only responsible for the core, while the cavity is likely a low-density region between the CME front and the MFR.",

The discovery of habitable exoplanets beyond our solar system will require a suite of instruments providing long-term monitoring for detection (e.g. with space and ground-based radial velocity observations), spectroscopic characterization of atmospheric and surface properties, and eventually deep chronograph-aided observations from e.g. JWST, Roman Space Telescope, and the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Detection of exoplanet magnetospheres is necessary to identify the most promising targets for follow-up characterization of biosignatures with these assets, and to provide an ensemble of objects for studies of magnetospheric conditions and atmospheric composition. Only observations of low-frequency radio emission will distinguish exoplanet magnetospheres (Hallinan et al. 2021). In this white paper, we present the two lunar radio array concepts under development that would be suitable to detect these exoplanet radio emissions. In addition, we also discuss the human exploration needed prior to construction of such lunar radio arrays while highlighting preferred candidate sites (Krolikowski & Elvis 2024) for the radio telescope.",

        "abstract": "Two main models coexist for the environment in which stars form. The clustered model stipulates that the bulk of star formation occurs within dense embedded clusters, but only a minority of them survive the residual gas expulsion phase caused by massive stellar feedback unbinding the clusters. On the other hand, the hierarchical model predicts that star formation happens at a range of scales and densities, where open clusters (OCs) only emerge from the densest regions. We aim to exploit a recent catalog of compact OCs, corrected for completeness, to obtain an updated estimation of the surface density star formation rate within OCs ($\\sum_{\\rm SFR,OC}$), which we compare with recent estimates of $\\sum_{\\rm SFR}$ to determine which model is more likely. We have applied two methods. The first one consisted of integrating over the power law that was fit for the mass function of the youngest OCs using a MC sampling. The second one consisted of counting the total compact mass within these youngest OCs within 1 kpc, so that the result could be directly compared with local values of $\\sum_{\\rm SFR}$. We estimated new $\\sum_{\\rm SFR,OC}$ values between $736^{+159}_{-176}$ and $875^{+34}_{-35}$ M$_{\\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, depending on the methodology. These results are significantly higher than previous $\\sum_{\\rm SFR,OC}$ estimates, which we attribute to the incompleteness of past catalogs, and are consistent with the majority ($\\geq$ 50 \\%) or even the vast majority ($\\geq$ 80 \\%) of the star formation occurring in initially compact clusters, through comparisons with $\\sum_{\\rm SFR}$ from the recent literature. Our new $\\sum_{\\rm SFR,OC}$ values are consistent with clustered formation being the most dominant mode of star formation.",

        "abstract": "Star formation governs galaxy evolution, shaping stellar mass assembly and gas consumption across cosmic time. The Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, linking star formation rate (SFR) and gas surface densities, is fundamental to understand star formation regulation, yet remains poorly constrained at $z > 2$ due to observational limitations and uncertainties in locally calibrated gas tracers. The [CII] $158 {\\rm \\mu m}$ line has recently emerged as a key probe of the cold ISM and star formation in the early Universe. We investigate whether the resolved [CII]-SFR and KS relations established at low redshift remain valid at $4 < z < 6$ by analysing 13 main-sequence galaxies from the ALPINE and CRISTAL surveys, using multi-wavelength data (HST, JWST, ALMA) at $\\sim2$ kpc resolution. We perform pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling with CIGALE on resolution-homogenised images. We develop a statistical framework to fit the [CII]-SFR relation that accounts for pixel covariance and compare our results to classical fitting methods. We test two [CII]-to-gas conversion prescriptions to assess their impact on inferred gas surface densities and depletion times. We find a resolved [CII]-SFR relation with a slope of $0.87 \\pm 0.15$ and intrinsic scatter of $0.19 \\pm 0.03$ dex, which is shallower and tighter than previous studies at $z\\sim5$. The resolved KS relation is highly sensitive to the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor: using a fixed global $\\alpha_{\\rm [CII]}$ yields depletion times of $0.5$-$1$ Gyr, while a surface brightness-dependent $W_{\\rm [CII]}$, places some galaxies with high gas density in the starburst regime ($<0.1$ Gyr). Future inputs from both simulations and observations are required to better understand how the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor depends on local ISM properties. We need to break this fundamental limit to properly study the KS relation at $z\\gtrsim4$.",

Understanding the physical origins of these extreme N-emitters at low redshifts enables us to better constrain chemical enrichment mechanisms that drove such high log(N/O) values in the early Universe. With direct N and O abundances derived for 944 SFGs with spectroscopic observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1), we report the discovery of 19 extreme N-emitters at low-z (z$<$0.5). Our sample of N-emitters represents a five-fold increase in their known number at low-z with 12+log(O/H)$\\leq$8, and statistically, $2.21\\pm0.91$\\% of DESI DR1 SFGs with reliable O and N abundances obtained directly, are extreme N-emitters. The sample spans a mass range of $\\sim 10^7$ - $10^{10}$~M$_{\\odot}$ with 12+log(O/H) range of $\\sim$7.1 - 8.2, and the N-emitter fraction is found to increase with increasing stellar mass and decreasing metallicity. The most extreme N-emitter in our sample has log(N/O)=$-0.53\\pm0.13$, while also having the lowest 12+log(O/H)=$7.08\\pm0.09$ and the highest stellar mass, log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\\odot}$)=$9.95\\pm0.13$ among our sample. With galactic chemical evolution models, we show that sustained N-enhancement by asymptotic giant branch stars, in conjunction with presence of outflows, can well explain the high log(N/O) of low-z extreme N-emitters. While single starbursts with outflow are sufficient to explain lower-mass N-emitters, more massive ones require a dual starburst scenario where a secondary starburst is triggered by inflow of gas.",

While widely used to interpret spiral and irregular structures, its probabilistic rules have lacked a formal statistical foundation. In this work, we establish a connection between the SSPSF model and spatio-temporal point processes (STPP), which describe events in space and time through history-dependent intensities. We show that the SSPSF update law is equivalent to a separable spatio-temporal Hawkes process, and we derive a simple likelihood function that recovers SSPSF parameters from historical star-formation event data under simplifying assumptions. Beyond the statistical formulation, the framework provides a new approach to analysing the propagation of star formation in galaxies, enabling observational surveys of star-forming regions to be interpreted within the STPP framework. Furthermore, the approach naturally extends to continuous-time models, offering a more realistic representation of galactic dynamics.",

These envelope models represent the progenitors of Type IIb supernovae (SNe-IIb), which have lost a substantial fraction of their H-rich envelope before undergoing core-collapse. The luminosity-to-mass ratio is high in these extended envelopes, and convection is strongly driven by Hydrogen and Helium opacity peaks. This surface convection, coupled with changes in the opacity, sustains large-amplitude low-azimuthal-order radial pulsations, creating order-of-magnitude variability in the stellar luminosity on a timescale of tens of days. If persistent prior to a SN-IIb, these variations could herald the upcoming explosion. Supersonic fluid motions across the outer layers of the star lead to both successful and failed mass ejection events, which shape the circumstellar environment and drive episodic mass loss ($\\sim10^{-6}-10^{-5}M_\\odot/$yr, in outbursts). The resulting 3D gas distribution in the outer atmosphere, responsible for early-time supernova shock-breakout and shock-cooling emission, shows orders-of-magnitude fluctuations in both space and time at any given radial location. This intrinsically complex halo of bound and unbound material complicates predictions for early SN-IIb lightcurves relative to spherically-symmetric models.

We report the discovery of a cosmic filament using 14 HI-selected galaxies that form a very thin elongated structure of 1.7 Mpc. These galaxies are embedded within a much larger cosmic web filament, traced by optical galaxies, that spans at least $\\sim 15$~Mpc. We find that the spin axes of the HI galaxies are significantly more strongly aligned with the cosmic web filament ($\\langle\\lvert \\cos \\psi \\rvert\\rangle = 0.64 \\pm 0.05$) than cosmological simulations predict, with the optically-selected galaxies showing alignment to a lesser degree ($\\langle\\lvert \\cos \\psi \\rvert\\rangle = 0.55 \\pm 0.05$). This structure demonstrates that within the cosmic filament, the angular momentum of galaxies is closely connected to the large-scale filamentary structure. We also find strong evidence that the galaxies are orbiting around the spine of the filament, making this one of the largest rotating structures discovered thus far, and from which we can infer that there is transfer of angular momentum from the filament to the individual galaxies. The abundance of HI galaxies along the filament and the low dynamical temperature of the galaxies within the filament indicates that this filament is at an early evolutionary stage where the imprint of cosmic matter flow on galaxies has been preserved over cosmic time.",

Recent progress through multi-wavelength follow-up of Einstein Probe discovered FXTs has shown that several are related to collapsars, which can also produce gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this paper we investigate the nature of the FXT EP250207b. The VLT/MUSE spectra of a nearby (15.9 kpc in projection) lenticular galaxy reveal no signs of recent star formation. If this galaxy is indeed the host, EP250207b lies at a redshift of z=0.082, implying a peak observed absolute magnitude for the optical counterpart of M_r=-14.5. At the time when supernovae (SNe) would peak, it is substantially fainter than all SN types. These results are inconsistent with a collapsar origin for EP250207b. The properties favour a binary compact object merger driven origin. The X-ray, optical and radio observations are compared with predictions of several types of extra-galactic transients, including afterglow and kilonova models. The data can be fit with a slightly off-axis viewing angle afterglow. However, the late-time (~30 day) optical/NIR counterpart is too bright for the afterglow and also for conventional kilonova models. This could be remedied if that late emission is due to a globular cluster or the core of a (tidally disrupted) dwarf galaxy. If confirmed, this would be the first case where the multi-wavelength properties of an FXT are found to be consistent with a compact object merger origin, increasing the parallels between FXTs and GRBs. We finally discuss if the source could originate in a higher redshift host galaxy.",

Across a metallicity range, our models predict that 80-90% of Type Ib/c and 60-85% of IIb SNe explode with a rapidly rotating, main-sequence companion. The observed luminosity distribution favors fairly inefficient mass accretion and failed explosions of the most massive stripped stars. The companion detection fraction broadly matches predictions, given the imaging depth, but appears elevated for Type IIb SNe. In all but one non-detection, a faint, undetected companion is the most likely scenario. The red, apparently evolved companions in a few Type Ib/c SNe may result from strong interaction with the ejecta, expected in $\\sim$12% of them. Companion demographics offer a powerful, independent probe of SESN progenitor systems, with the current sample disfavoring efficient accretion and supporting Wolf-Rayet non-explodability. Larger companion samples and follow-up studies will further clarify binary pathways to SESNe, serving as benchmarks for transient surveys.",

A circumgalactic medium (CGM) origin for DLAs naturally explains high redshift HI absorption-selected galaxy detections at physical separations much greater than the likely extents of the galaxy disks \\citep{Neeleman2017, Neeleman2019}. The observed $z\\sim 4$ DLA HI column densities are large and comparable to interstellar (ISM) gas columns at which substantial molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) abundances occur. We therefore investigate the possible molecular content of high-redshift CGM gas, and its potential detectability via (rest-frame) far-ultraviolet (UV) absorption line studies. For this purpose we develop an analytic sub-grid model for HI-to-H$_2$ transitions and incorporate the model with zoom-in FIRE-2 simulations of evolving high-$z$ galaxies. We include dust absorption and scattering computations for the transfer of photodissociating Lyman-Werner (LW) band radiation. We find that the typical extents of detectable H$_2$ sightlines are $\\approx 0.1\\, R_{\\rm vir}$, independent of redshift from $z=2.5$ to 5. We argue that a CGM origin for DLAs naturally explains the low detection rates of H$_2$ in DLA observations, as the low CGM densities and relatively strong far-UV fields lead to molecular fractions much lower than observed in the ISM at comparable HI columns.",

The average stellar metallicity decreases from ~1.9 Zsun near the center of the galaxy to ~0.3 Zsun at the optical outskirts. The galactocentric radial metallicity gradient is statistically consistent with previous studies of the gas-phase oxygen abundance from H II regions using the direct method. The H II region-based Cepheid metallicities used by Riess et al. in their determination of the Hubble constant H_0 are in substantial agreement with our measurements. The direct method gas-phase metallicities of the 18 star-forming galaxies we have analyzed so far, when adjusted upward for a mean ~0.15 dex oxygen dust depletion factor, are in good agreement with those we infer from the supergiants, over a factor of 50 in metallicity. From the same data, we derive an expression for the metal-dependent depletion of oxygen in photoionized nebulae.

        "abstract": "Constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity (LPnG) obtained from galaxy power spectra are limited by the perfect degeneracy between the LPnG parameter $f_{\\rm NL}$ and the bias parameter $b_{\\phi}$ which encodes the response of galaxy clustering to a change in the amplitude of primordial curvature fluctuations. For galaxies observed by galaxy surveys, the relation between $b_{\\phi}$ and the galaxy bias $b_{g}$ is poorly understood and differs significantly from the universal mass function ansatz. In this paper, we investigate this non-universality in the context of dark-matter halos using the Separate Universe framework, focussing on dark-matter halos selected by mass and/or concentration. We show that the Separate Universe framework provides a natural explanation of the observed universality in the bias of dark-matter halos selected purely by their mass, independent of the spherical collapse picture of halo formation. We further propose an explanation for the observed non-universality in halos selected by concentration and corroborate it with $N$-body simulations in scale-free (EdS) and $\\Lambda\\text{CDM}$ cosmologies. In particular, we show that the relation between $b_{\\phi}$ and halo bias $b_{h}$ for halos selected by concentration in matter-dominated cosmologies tends towards universality at the highest halo masses due to such halos gravitationally dominating their environment throughout their evolution. We also argue that concentration-selected halos of lower masses exhibit non-universality due to their mass accretion being significantly affected by the gravitational influence of neighbouring, more massive halos. Our results suggest that any non-universality in high redshift ($z\\gtrsim 3$), high-bias objects observed by realistic galaxy surveys is entirely an artifact of the associated selection function.",

The European Space Agency's Gaia mission has revolutionized the census of star clusters in the Milky Way, while simultaneously providing an unprecedented homogeneous all-sky catalog of variable stars. Here, we leverage the third Gaia data release to obtain an empirical bird's eye view of stellar evolution based on 34760 variable stars residing in 1192 Galactic open clusters (OCs) containing 173294 members (variable member fraction 20.0%). Using precise OC distances, dereddened magnitudes, and consistently determined ages, we a) pinpointed regions of pulsational instability across the color-absolute magnitude diagram (CaMD); b) traced the occurrence rate of variables as a function of age, and c) considered the evolution of rotation periods and photometric activity (gyrochronology). The occurrence of pulsating stars can serve as a model- and reddening-independent age estimator. Our results underline that jointly considering stellar variability and OC membership enables a plethora of further applications, such as age dating or dereddening OCs based on expected CaMD locations of variable stars. Upcoming Gaia data releases and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will vastly increase the extent to which the details of variable stars in OCs can empirically unravel the astrophysics and evolution of stellar populations.",

By finding other GCs similar to EXT8, it should become clear if and/or how EXT8 can fit into our current understanding of GC formation. We aim to test the potential of integrated-light narrow-band Ca II H & K photometry as a proxy for the metallicity of GCs to be able to provide effective candidate selection for massive GCs below the GC metallicity floor ([Fe/H] $\\leq$ -2.5), such as EXT8. We investigate the behaviour of two colours involving the CaHK filter employed by the Pristine survey, CaHK-u and CaHK-g, as a function of metallicity through CFHT MegaCam imaging of EXT8 and a wide set of M31 GCs covering the metallicity range of -2.9 $\\leq$ [Fe/H] $\\leq$ +0.4. Additionally, we investigate if the CaHK colours are strongly influenced by horizontal branch morphology through available morphology measurements. In both of the CaHK colours, EXT8 and two other potential GCs below the metallicity floor can be selected from other metal-poor GCs ([Fe/H] $\\leq$ -1.5) with CaHK-g showing the larger metallicity sensitivity. The RMS of linear fits to the metal-poor GCs show an uncertainty of 0.3 dex on metallicity estimations for both colours. Comparisons with u-g and g-z/F450W-F850L colours reinforce the notion that CaHK photometry can be used for effective candidate selection as they reduce false positive selection rates by at least a factor of 2. We find no strong influence of the horizontal branch morphology on the CaHK colours that would interfere with candidate selection, although the assessment is limited by quantity and quality of available data.",

We present an holistic framework that we dub `Parametrized Post-Newtonian Cosmology' (PPNC), which can be used for obtaining theory-agnostic constraints on deviations from GR using a single unified set of parameters that apply on all astrophysical and cosmological scales. Our approach is based on the formalism and philosophy of the highly successful Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) framework, but allows us to combine observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) with Solar System observations of the Cassini probe and ephemeris of Mars. The full combination of these data sets constrains average deviations from GR over the history of the Universe to be less than $\\sim 10\\%$, with PPNC parameter values $\\bar{\\alpha}=0.97^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ and $\\bar{\\gamma}=0.97^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ at the $68\\%$ confidence level (GR corresponds to $\\bar{\\alpha}=\\bar{\\gamma}=1$). We find that these gravitational parameters have a strong mutual degeneracy, and are constrained to be within $1\\%$ of each other for all of cosmic history. Our results demonstrate the ability of the PPNC framework to combine astrophysical, Solar System and cosmological tests of gravity into a single set of unified constraints. We expect our approach to be particularly useful for upcoming missions in both cosmology and astrophysics, which ultimately seek to constrain the same underlying gravitational interaction.",

        "abstract": "Comparing the dynamical and stellar masses of Milky Way (MW) globular clusters (GCs) reveals a discrepancy exceeding a factor of two. Since this substantial invisible mass is concentrated in the cluster centre, it is attributed to stellar remnants. The majority of mass in remnants consists of white dwarfs (WDs). Allocating over half of a GC's current mass to WDs could significantly restrict the dynamical evolution scenarios governing stellar clusters. As the most massive stars in GCs, black holes (BHs) exert a substantial effect on the escape rate of lower mass stars, such as WDs. This paper aims to identify which scenarios of BH natal kicks can accurately reproduce the notable dark remnant fraction observed in MW GCs. We compare the observed remnant fraction of MW GCs with a comprehensive grid of direct \\Nbody simulations while adjusting the natal kick received by BHs. Our results reveal that simulations employing low natal kicks to BHs are the only ones capable of mirroring the remnant fraction of MW GCs. According to the Spitzer instability, the presence of a BH population prompts the formation of a BH sub-system (BHSub) at the centre of a star cluster. The BHSub serves as an energetic power plant, continually releasing kinetic energy through few-body encounters between single and binary BHs, and transferring the generated energy to the entire stellar population. This energy induces a significant difference in the ejection rate of stellar remnants and luminous stars, ultimately increasing the fraction of dark remnants within the star cluster.",

Fourteen of the white dwarfs fit single-component SEDs well, while three showed a good fit with a two-component SED model,indicating a binary system comprising a white dwarf and a low-mass main-sequence star. The effective temperature, radius, luminosity, and mass of white dwarfs range between 22000 - 70000 K, 0.008 - 0.028 Rsun, 0.09 - 3.0 Lsun, and 0.30 - 1.13 Msun, respectively.

Identifying the voids from the TNG300-1 simulations via the Void-Finder algorithm, we explore if and how the shapes of the TNG galaxies located on void surfaces are aligned with the directions toward the void centers. Noting that only the giant void-surface galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\\star}\\ge 10^{10.5}\\,h^{-1}\\,M_{\\odot}$ exhibit significant tendency of perpendicular alignments, we dichotomize them into two $M_{\\star}$-controlled samples according to their morphologies (elliptical or spiral), colors (redder or bluer), sSFR (lower or higher) and stellar ages (older or younger). It is found that the void-galaxy perpendicular alignment becomes stronger for the cases that the void-surface galaxies have elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower sSFR. The numerical results are also shown to be well described by the analytical one-parameter model derived under the assumption of the existence of a linear scaling between the covariance matrices of galaxy shape axes and local tidal tensors. Our result implies that the compression of adjacent matter due to the formation and rapid expansion of cosmic voids prevent them from radial infall/accretion, which in turn contribute to stalling and quenching the giant void-surface galaxies. Given that the formation epochs and expansion rates of cosmic voids depend sensitively on the dark energy equation of state, we also discuss a possibility of using the abundance of elliptical void-surface galaxies as a probe of dark energy.",

        "abstract": "Accurate estimation of dark matter halo masses for galaxy groups is central to studies of galaxy evolution and for leveraging group catalogues as cosmological probes. We present a calibration and evaluation of two complementary halo mass estimators: a dynamical estimator based on the virial theorem, and an empirical relation between the sum of the stellar masses of the three most massive group galaxies and the halo mass (SHMR). Using state-of-the-art semi-analytic models (SHARK, SAGE, and GAEA) to generate mock light-cone catalogues, we quantify the accuracy, uncertainty, and model dependence of each method. The calibrated virial theorem achieves negligible systematic bias (mean $\\Delta$ = -0.01 dex) and low scatter (mean $\\sigma$ = 0.20 dex) with no sensitivity to baryonic physics. The calibrated SHMR yields the highest precision (mean $\\Delta$ = 0.02 dex, mean $\\sigma$ = 0.14 dex) but shows greater model dependence due to sensitivity to baryonic physics across the models. We demonstrate applications to observational catalogues, including the empirical halo mass function and mapping quenched fractions in the stellar mass-halo mass plane. We provide guidance: the virial theorem is recommended for GAMA-like surveys (i < 19.2) at z < 0.1 where minimal model dependence is required, while the SHMR is optimal for high-precision halo mass estimates across diverse catalogues with limits of z < 0.3. These calibrated estimators will aid upcoming wide-area spectroscopic surveys in probing the connection between galaxies and their host dark matter halos.",

        "abstract": "After carbon and oxygen, $^{22}$Ne is the most abundant element in white dwarf interiors. As C/O white dwarfs (WDs) crystallize, they are predicted to go through a distillation process in the central layers if they have a sufficiently high $^{22}$Ne mass fraction of $\\gtrsim2.5$\\%. Observational evidence for distillation comes from an over-density of WDs on the Q-branch in Gaia color-magnitude diagrams, which indicates that $\\sim6$\\% of massive WDs are delayed in their cooling by as much as $\\sim10$ Gyr. However, it is unclear how these stars end up with such a high concentration of $^{22}$Ne and if a significant fraction of the more common average-mass WDs go through distillation. We argue that a significant metal-rich stellar population in the solar neighborhood should lead to distilled WDs, without requiring a binary merger. We use MESA along with the CNO abundances derived from high-resolution spectroscopy of stars included in the Hypatia catalog to predict the $^{22}$Ne mass fraction in their descendant WDs. We find that 0.6-2.5\\% of the WDs in the solar neighborhood have sufficient $^{22}$Ne in their interiors to go through multi-Gyr cooling delays, which could significantly inflate their numbers in the observed samples. Hence, $^{22}$Ne distillation and long-lived habitable zones around WDs should be relatively common in the solar neighborhood. We also use a Galactic model to predict the fraction of WDs that go through distillation as a function of Galactocentric distance. The fraction of distilled WDs is $\\sim2$-8\\% near the Galactic center, and declines steadily toward the outer disk.",

In the previous article, we presented a sample of 48 high-mass Kepler red giants and measured their asteroseismic parameters. This article presents spectroscopic measurements from the same sample, using high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectra to determine \\Teff{}, [Fe/H], \\logg{}, and $v \\sin i$. We refined our previous estimates of the stellar masses and radii based on the new \\Teff{}. We also examined spectral features that could indicate binary activity, such as the Li line and [C/N] ratios. We found no Li-rich stars or clear [C/N] anomalies, but we observed a correlation between [C/N] and [Fe/H]. We measured chromospheric activity using the $S$-index of the Ca II H \\& K lines and found no correlation with internal magnetic fields. However, we confirmed an anti-correlation between surface chromospheric activity and radial mode oscillation amplitudes, which indicates that strong surface magnetic fields weaken stellar oscillations. Finally, we used the Gaia DR3 astrometric data to show that our sample of stars have orbits consistent with all three Galactic kinematic regions. Although these stars are quite young, their orbits carry them into the thick disk and even the halo, raising questions about the accuracy and viability of kinematics in unravelling Galactic history. In future work, we plan to use the spectroscopic parameters measured here to provide better constraints for boutique frequency modelling, which will allow us to test the asteroseismic scaling relations at the high-mass regime.",

        "abstract": "Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are among the primary sources of dust in galaxies. In this study, we derive theoretical upper limits on dust masses as a function of supernova (SN) progenitors with initial masses between 9 and 120 Msun, based on previously established models of dust formation chemistry in CCSNe. We find that O-rich dust, particularly silicates, dominates the dust budget, with masses ranging from 0.02 to 0.9 Msun, and that the total mass of O-rich dust increases with progenitor mass. C-rich amorphous carbon dust is significant for lower-mass progenitors (up to 15 Msun), but its mass never exceeds 0.05 Msun. For progenitors up to 30 Msun, we provide best-fit functions describing the masses of O-rich dust, C-rich dust, and CO molecules. A large stochastic variation is found in the predicted masses of silicate dust, which correlates with the randomness of shell-merger events in the pre-explosion phases of massive stars. Furthermore, we show that the dust mass for a given progenitor can vary by a factor of 2-5, reflecting differences in pre-explosion abundance profiles predicted by the stellar evolution codes KEPLER and MESA. We emphasize that the final dust yield in CCSNe is primarily determined by stochastic stellar yields and uncertainties in pre-explosion nucleosynthesis, while explosion properties mainly influence the timescales of dust formation.",

Archival HST imaging showed interestingly perturbed morphology of the host with a bright ~30 kpc arc feature, extended filamentary structure of line-emitting gas and clumpy blue excess emission co-spatial with the radio hotspots. Our VLT/SINFONI integral-field observations reveal complex, spatially-resolved H{\\alpha}+[NII] emission in this source. A prominent blue-shifted wing in H{\\alpha} indicates an ionized gas flow extending out to ~18 kpc from the nuclear region. Combining our SINFONI narrow-H{\\alpha} data with archival HST/UV and VLA imaging, we map the young stellar population in the host and compare the spatial distribution of star-forming regions with the ionized gas motion and jet structure. In the attempt to characterize the feedback mechanisms in this chaotic system, we suggest that the powerful radio source dominates the feedback with possible contribution from radiation pressure due to AGN accretion. We also propose that the expanding jet cocoon likely shocked the ISM, triggering a kpc-scale ionized gas outflow and new starbursts that enhanced ongoing merger-induced star formation.",

In the low-extinction regions of the Ursa Major molecular cloud complex, we demonstrate that Galactic dust reddening maps constructed from observations of far-infrared emission are insensitive to variations in the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and, as a result, to PAH-induced variations in reddening. Using galaxy counts to validate various reddening maps, we find evidence that maps based on far-infrared emission erroneously under-predict reddening compared to stellar reddening maps. This underestimation by far-infrared emission based reddening maps -- representing the largest discrepancy between maps of up to $E(B-V)=0.08$ mag -- is correlated with the relative brightness of PAH emission. Furthermore, we demonstrate theoretically that changes in PAH abundance via accretion from the gas phase is capable of altering extinction significantly with only minor changes to far-infrared emission. We show that modeling the extinction of Ursa Major using both far-infrared and mid-infrared emission more accurately traces dust extinction variations due to changes in PAH abundance. Finally, we discuss how SPHEREx observations of the 3.3 $\\mu$m PAH feature are a promising way to overcome this limitation of far-infrared emission.",

The combination of enhanced speed and accuracy facilitated by $\\texttt{21cmKAN}$ enables rapid and highly accurate physical parameter estimation analyses of multiple 21 cm models, which is needed to fully characterize the complex feature space across models and produce robust constraints on the early universe. Rather than using static functions to model complex relationships like traditional fully-connected neural networks do, KANs learn expressive transformations that can perform significantly better for low-dimensional physical problems. $\\texttt{21cmKAN}$ predicts a given signal for two well-known models in the community in 3.7 ms on average and trains about 75 times faster than $\\texttt{21cmLSTM}$, when utilizing the same typical GPU. $\\texttt{21cmKAN}$ is able to achieve these speeds because of its learnable, data-driven transformations and its relatively small number of trainable parameters compared to a memory-based emulator. We show that $\\texttt{21cmKAN}$ required less than 30 minutes to train and fit these simulated signals and obtain unbiased posterior distributions. We find that the transparent architecture of $\\texttt{21cmKAN}$ allows us to conveniently interpret and further validate its emulation results in terms of the sensitivity of the 21 cm signal to each physical parameter.

Significant variability is detected in 85 per cent of disks and across all timescales probed, from minutes to weeks to years, where the largest flux changes correlate with the longest time baselines, and the infrared excesses persist utterly. While each source is idiosyncratic, the overall results indicate the most variable disks correlate with those that are the brightest (dustiest), and also among those with detected gas, demonstrating both dust and gas are produced via ongoing collisions. There is a correlation between flux and colour changes, where disks tend to appear redder when dimmer and bluer when brighter, consistent with an excess of small dust grains produced in collisions, followed by a gradual return to equilibrium. The overall results are a drastic departure from the predictions of the canonical - geometrically thin, optically thick - disk in both flux and colour, but are broadly consistent with collisional evolution based on a simple model. The data presented herein constitute a legacy resource that can inform time-series studies of polluted and dusty white dwarfs, and importantly serve as a basis for future disk modelling, beyond the pioneering canonical framework.",

The Gaia mission has discovered seven such hypervelocity WDs with inflated radii indicative of shock heating by SN ejecta. We study the interaction between SN ejecta and Roche lobe-filling 0.08 - 0.45 $M_{\\odot}$ helium WD companions using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with Athena++. Given the importance of the later thermal evolution, we include an accurate equation-of-state for the degenerate helium WD donor. We show that a lower-mass, larger-radius WD companion is more strongly impacted by SN ejecta and undergoes substantial mass loss. We find a tight relation between the fractional mass loss and the ratio between the ejecta ram pressure and donor volume-averaged pressure, which can be used for predicting mass loss in other systems. In the most extreme case, the companion becomes a very inflated $\\approx0.02\\,M_{\\odot}$ object. We find helium mass loss $\\approx 0.005 - 0.06\\,M_{\\odot}$ with velocities $\\approx $ 1,000$-$4,000 km/s, which may lead to emission lines in the nebular phase.

In this study, we introduce the BSN application, whose name is taken from the BSN project. The application is designed for analyzing contact binary system light curves, supporting photometric data, and employing an MCMC algorithm for efficient parameter estimation. The BSN application generates synthetic light curves more than 40 times faster than PHOEBE during the MCMC fitting process. The BSN application enhances light curve analysis with an expanded feature set and a more intuitive interface while maintaining compliance with established scientific standards. In addition, we present the first light curve analyses of four contact binary systems based on the TESS data, utilizing the BSN application version 1.0. We also conducted a light curve analysis using the PHOEBE Python code and compared the resulting outputs. Two of the target systems exhibited asymmetries in the maxima of their light curves, which were appropriately modeled by introducing a cold starspot on one of the components. The estimated mass ratios of these total-eclipse systems place them within the category of low mass ratio contact binary stars. The estimation of the absolute parameters for the selected systems was carried out using the $P-a$ empirical relationship.

        "title": "Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities",
        "abstract": "When 3D relative displacement $\\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\\Gamma \\equiv \\log_{10}\\sqrt{G/G_{\\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\\rm N}>10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\\Gamma=0.063_{-0.047}^{+0.058}$ or $0.134_{-0.040}^{+0.050}$ for $7\\text{ or }8$ binaries with $g_{\\rm N}<10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$ (depending on one system) showing tension with Newton. The Newtonian ``outlier'' is at the boundary set by the Newtonian escape velocity, but can be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshift ($z \\ge 10$) from a combination of dark matter capture, black-hole mergers, and gas accretion. It has previously been shown that SMBHs can form by $z \\approx 10$ via black-hole mergers, Eddington-limited Bondi gas accretion and tidal disruption events with stars within dense nuclear clusters. Here, we show that the capture of collisionless dark matter by a growing SMBH also substantially contributes, in some cases by an order of magnitude to the final SMBH mass. In particular, we show that a small seed stellar-remnant black hole can more easily reach $> 10^7$ M$_{\\odot}$ by $z = 10$ in the core of dense nuclear star clusters when dark matter is included. This remains true for either cold dark matter or ultralight dark matter if the mass of the ULDM particle is $^>_\\sim 10^{-20}$ eV. We highlight the unique evolution of ULDM capture by the growing SMBH when the ULDM de Broglie wavelength exceeds the initial nuclear star cluster half-mass radius.",

        "abstract": "LDN 1616 is a cometary globule located approximately 8 degrees west of the Orion OB1 associations. The massive OB stars in the Orion belt region act as catalysts, triggering the star formation activity observed in the L1616 region, which is a photodissociation region (PDR). This paper provides an in-depth analysis of gas kinematics within the L1616 PDR, leveraging the Heterodyne Array Receiver Program (HARP) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to observe 13CO and C18O (3-2) emissions. Employing the Clumpfind algorithm on the C18O emission data, we identify three distinct clumps within this PDR. For each of these clumps, we derive key physical parameters, including the mean kinetic temperature, optical depth, and velocity dispersion. In addition, we compute the non-thermal velocity dispersion and Mach number, providing critical insights into the turbulent dynamics of the gas. A comprehensive evaluation of mass, including virial and energy budget evaluations, is conducted to assess the gravitational stability and star-forming potential of the identified clumps. While previous studies have proposed that radiation-driven implosion (RDI) is the dominant mechanism initiating star formation in LDN 1616, our results suggest that the clumps may represent pre-existing substructures within the PDR. This interpretation is supported by our estimation of a relatively low interstellar radiation field, which, although insufficient to form clumps independently, may enhance gravitational instability through additional compression. Thus, our findings offer a more nuanced perspective on the role of RDI, highlighting its capacity to trigger star formation by amplifying the instability of pre-existing clumpy structures in PDRs like LDN 1616.",

        "abstract": "JWST is discovering a plethora of species in planet-forming disks around very low-mass stars such as C2H2, C6H6, C4H2, CH3 etc. The column densities of these species retrieved from 0D slab models are very large, e.g. of the order of $10^{20}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. This is indicating a carbon-dominated chemistry in a gas with a high C/O ratio. The disk around 2MASS-J1605321-1993159 (M4.5) is one such source showing a molecular pseudo-continuum of C2H2. Still two oxygen-bearing molecules, CO and CO2 are also detected in this source. We aim to take the next step beyond 0D slab models to interpret the spectrum. We examine whether 2D thermo-chemical disk models can produce the large inferred column densities of \\ce{C2H2} in the inner regions of the disk and produce a pseudo-continuum in the mid-IR spectrum. We also want to constrain whether depletion of oxygen or enrichment of carbon is causing the high C/O ratio triggering a carbon-dominated chemistry. We utilize the radiative thermo-chemical disk model P{\\tiny RO}D{\\tiny I}M{\\tiny O} to identify a disk structure which is capable of producing the observed molecular emission of species such as CO, CO2, C2H2, and H2O simultaneously. The spectrum is generated using the fast line tracer FLiTs. We derive the gas temperature $\\langle T \\rangle$, column density $\\langle$ log$_{\\rm {10}} N\\rangle$ and the emitting area $\\langle r_{\\rm{1}} - r_{\\rm{2}} \\rangle$ for these molecules from the 2D disk model and compare them to the parameters retrieved originally from 0D slab models. We use the different effect that changing the O or C abundance has on CO and C2H2 respectively to discriminate between O depletion and C enhancement. We find that a disk structure characterised by the presence of a gap can best explain the observations. The inner disk is strongly depleted in dust, especially small grains ($<5\\,\\mu$m), and ..",

        "abstract": "Using a 90 ks Chandra ACIS-S observation in the 0.3--7 keV band, along with complementary Low-Frequency Array and Karl G.~Jansky Very Large Array data in the 120--168 MHz and 1--2 GHz ranges, we study the diffuse emission around the nearby dwarf galaxy KUG~1138+327. Our analysis reveals a diffuse X-ray feature on the southern side, disconnected from the galactic disk. This feature exhibits a hard X-ray spectrum, which is highly unusual for an outflow from a dwarf galaxy. We interpret the irregularly shaped feature as hot plasma in a young galaxy cluster at redshift 0.5, supported by X-ray spectral fitting and consistent with the optical redshift of the central elliptical galaxy of a known cluster identified by a red sequence. Additionally, we detect a radio lobe east of the X-ray feature, likely produced by an AGN offset from the cluster center and confined primarily by ram pressure from the ambient medium. The lobe shows a steep nonthermal radio spectrum, suggesting a cosmic-ray age of $\\gtrsim 5 \\times 10^{7}$~yr. Assuming energy equipartition between cosmic rays and magnetic fields, we estimate the lobe's total energy to be $\\sim 9 \\times 10^{56}~\\mathrm{erg}$, comparable to the thermal energy in the same volume. This study thus identifies a background young cluster projected next to KUG~1138+327 and highlights the potentially significant role of off-center AGN feedback in shaping the intracluster medium.",

While Bayesian inferences for Effective Field Theory models of galaxy clustering can be highly sensitive to the choice of priors for extended cosmological models, frequentist inferences are not susceptible to such effects. We compare Bayesian and frequentist constraints for the parameter set $\\{\\sigma_8, H_0, \\Omega_{\\rm{m}}, w_0, w_a\\}$ when fitting to the full-shape of the power spectrum multipoles, the post-reconstruction Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, as well as external datasets from the CMB and type Ia supernovae measurements. Bayesian prior effects are very significant for the $w_0w_a$CDM model; while the $1 \\sigma$ frequentist confidence intervals encompass the maximum a posteriori (MAP), the Bayesian credible intervals almost always exclude the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and the MAP - indicating strong prior volume projection effects - unless supernovae data are included. We observe limited prior effects for the $\\Lambda$CDM model, due to the reduced number of parameters. When DESI full-shape and BAO data are jointly fit, we obtain the following $1\\sigma$ frequentist confidence intervals for $\\Lambda$CDM ($w_0w_a$CDM): $\\sigma_8 = 0.867^{+0.048}_{-0.041} , \\ H_0 = 68.91^{+0.80}_{-0.79} \\ \\rm{km \\ s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}} , \\ \\Omega_{\\rm{m}} = 0.3038\\pm0.0110$ ($\\sigma_8 = 0.793^{+0.069}_{-0.048} , \\ H_0 = 64.9^{+4.8}_{-2.8} \\ \\rm{km \\ s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}} , \\ \\Omega_{\\rm{m}} = 0.369^{+0.029}_{-0.059}$ , $w_0 = -0.24^{+0.17}_{-0.64}$ , $w_a = -2.5^{+1.9}_{}$), corresponding to 0.7$\\sigma$, 0.3$\\sigma$, 0.7$\\sigma$ (1.9$\\sigma$, 3.4$\\sigma$, 5.6$\\sigma$, 5.5$\\sigma$, 5.6$\\sigma$) shifts between the MLE relative to the Bayesian posterior mean for $\\Lambda$CDM ($w_0w_a$CDM) respectively.",

However, the scalability of this work remains limited due to the need for manual intervention, poor calibration solutions for the Dutch LOFAR stations, and high computational costs. We address these issues by: (1) improving automated self-calibration using a signal-to-noise metric and a neural network for image artefact detection; (2) implementing a refined calibration strategy for the Dutch LOFAR stations; and (3) cutting computational costs by optimising the data processing strategy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our automated processing strategy by reprocessing one previously reduced dataset and a new dataset from the ELAIS-N1 deep field, which features more severe ionospheric conditions. We find calibration artefacts across facet boundaries to be reduced with our improved automated calibration strategy and achieve a computational cost reduction of about a factor of 4 to 6 compared to previous work, where the exact factor depends on whether a single observation is processed or multiple observations of the same sky area are combined. Further optimisation and improved handling of data with baseline-dependent averaging could reduce this in the near future by another factor of two, bringing the total cost for an 8-hour observation below 30,000 CPU core hours. This work enables ultra-deep imaging at sensitivities on the order of a few $\\mu$Jy/beam.

In this picture, a mechanical failure of the crust excites seismic motions of the magnetar surface that launch force-free waves into the magnetosphere.

Our simulations follow the propagation of high-frequency magneto-elastic waves in the entire crust, and include magnetic coupling to the dipolar magnetosphere and liquid core through simplified radiation boundary conditions. We observe seismic waves bouncing between the crust-core interface and the surface with a characteristic frequency $\\sim 1$ kHz, which could appear as a modulation of the magnetospheric radiation. Both the star quake and its associated magnetospheric wave emission are strongly damped on a timescale $\\sim 10 \\ \\rm ms$ by magnetic coupling to the liquid core. Since seismic waves are significantly damped before they can spread laterally around the crust, magnetospheric wave emission occurs primarily near the initial epicenter of the quake. Our simulations suggest that non-axisymmetric quakes will launch a mixture of Alfv\\'en and fast magnetosonic waves into the magnetosphere. The results will be important for interpreting magnetar bursts and understanding the possible trigger mechanisms of fast radio bursts.",

        "abstract": "A damped random walk (DRW) process is often used to describe the temporal UV/optical continuum variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, recent investigations have shown that this model fails to capture the full spectrum of AGN variability. In this work, we model the 22-year-long light curves of $21,767$ quasars, spanning the redshift range $0.28 < z < 2.71$, as a noise-driven damped harmonic oscillator (DHO) process. The light curves, in the optical $g$ and $r$ bands, are collected and combined from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, and the Zwicky Transient Facility. A DHO process can be defined using four parameters, two for describing its long-term behavior/variability, and the other two for describing its short-term behavior/variability. We find that the best-fit DHO model describes the observed variability of our quasar light curves better than the best-fit DRW model. Furthermore, the best-fit DHO parameters exhibit correlations with the rest-frame wavelength, the Eddington ratio, and the black hole mass of our quasars. Based on the power spectral density shape of the best-fit DHOs and these correlations, we suggest that the observed long-term variability of our quasars can be best explained by accretion rate or thermal fluctuations originating from the accretion disk, and the observed short-term variability can be best explained by reprocessing of X-ray variability originating from the corona. The additional information revealed by DHO modeling emphasizes the need to go beyond DRW when analyzing AGN light curves delivered by next-generation wide-field time-domain surveys.",

As large-scale surveys generate increasing volumes of light curve data, the demand for automated and reliable classification techniques continues to grow.

In this study, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for classifying variable stars using raw light curve data and their known periods. Our approach eliminates the need for manual feature extraction and preselected preprocessing steps. By applying phase-folding and interpolation to structure the light curves, the model learns variability patterns critical for accurate classification. Trained and evaluated on the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) dataset, our model achieves an average accuracy of 90% and an F1 score of 0.86 across six well-known classes of variable stars. The CNN effectively handles the diverse shapes and sampling cadences of light curves, offering a robust, automated, data-driven solution for classifying variable stars. This automated, data-driven method provides a robust solution for classifying variable stars, enabling the efficient analysis of large datasets from both current and future sky surveys.",

        "abstract": "Massive stars play a critical role in the evolution of galaxies, but their formation remains poorly understood. One challenge is accurate measurement of the physical properties of massive protostars, such as current stellar mass, envelope mass, outflow cavity properties, and system orientation. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is widely-used to test models against observations. The far-infrared SED traces cold dust in envelopes, while the near- and mid-infrared (MIR) probes emission from outflow cavities and/or the inner envelope. However, SED fitting has degeneracy limiting its ability to yield accurate measurements of protostellar properties. Here, we develop image profile (IMPRO) fitting as a method to improve the characterization of protostars. We utilize brightness distributions from multi-wavelength MIR images of massive protostars taken by SOFIA/FORCAST as part of the SOFIA Massive Star Formation (SOMA) survey to constrain protostellar properties via comparison to a grid of radiative transfer models. We develop a fitting pipeline to extract information along the outflow axis, which is then combined with the SED fitting to yield improved constraints on protostellar properties. We apply the IMPRO fitting method on the nearby massive protostar Cepheus A, finding that its properties become more tightly constrained compared to SED fitting, especially in the inclination of the source. However, for the more distant G35.20-0.74N, we find that the spatial resolution of SOFIA/FORCAST limits the utility of this combined fitting pipeline. However, higher resolution MIR observations, e.g., with JWST, are expected to greatly expand the applicability of this fitting technique to protostars across the Galaxy.",

We specifically explore the spectral appearance of multi-component accretion flows where the solution can independently transition between cold, thin disks and hot, advection-dominated torii depending on the local accretion rate. Using a three-disk model, we compute spectral energy distributions for four possible accretion configurations and assess their observational signatures, including which frequencies might reflect variability at the binary orbital period. The spectral modeling reveals that binary accretion can self-consistently account for many of the properties of standard AGN, while the variability analysis shows that hydrodynamic modulation at the binary period is most likely in the thermal emission and low-frequency synchrotron components. Doppler boosting of emitting material bound to a single binary component would also induce periodic variability. We apply our model to the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and demonstrate that a mixed-component accretion state (plus a jet feature) can self-consistently capture the observed broadband spectrum. Our model offers a framework for interpreting candidate SMBHBs and motivates future multi-wavelength follow-up of potential multi-messenger sources, as well as more detailed future modeling of multi-component binary accretion.",

To improve model generalisation and reduce overfitting, we developed a novel image representation by transforming phase-folded light curves into polar coordinates combined with hexbin visualisation. Our hierarchical approach in the first stage classifies systems into detached and overcontact types, and in the second stage identifies the presence or absence of spots. The binary classification models achieved high accuracy ($>96\\%$) on validation data across multiple passbands (Gaia~$G$, $I$, and $TESS$) and demonstrated strong performance ($>94\\%$, up to $100\\%$ for $TESS$) when tested on extensive observational data from the OGLE, DEBCat, and WUMaCat catalogues. While the primary binary classification was highly successful, the secondary task of automated spot detection performed poorly, revealing a significant limitation of our models for identifying subtle photometric features. This study highlights the potential of computer vision for EB morphological classification in large-scale surveys, but underscores the need for further research into robust, automated spot detection.",

Assuming an optimistic binary neutron star (BNS) merger rate, we generate synthetic inspiral gravitational wave (GW) signals corresponding to one year of observation. From these simulated data, we compute the covariance matrix and posterior distributions for nuclear properties and EoS. Our results show that the EoS can be tightly constrained, particularly in the density range between one and four times nuclear saturation density. However, due to the scarcity of of low-mass neutron stars in the GW sample, the EoS at sub-saturation densities remains poorly constrained. Thus, in turn, leads to weaker constraints on neutron star radii, as the radii are sensitive to the low-density EoS. Additionally, We note that the nuclear properties are degenerate in their influence on the EoS, making them difficult to be constrained through GW observations alone. These highlights inherent limitations of inspiral GW signals in probing dense matter properties. Therefore, precise radius measurements, post-merger GW observations, and supplementary constraints from terrestrial nuclear experiments remain essential for a comprehensive understanding of dense matter.",

When relativistic bunches are injected into the magnetized plasma of a magnetar's magnetosphere at the Cherenkov angle, their emitted waves achieve phase coherence through constructive interference. Furthermore, the three-dimensional geometry of the bunches plays a crucial role in influencing the coherence of the radiation. Within the framework of CChR, we predict the existence of THz emission counterparts associated with FRBs and explain the observed characteristics of the THz-emitting magnetar SGR J1745-2900. Detections of such counterparts by upgraded millimeter telescopes (e.g., Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, IRAM) would be expected to provide new insights into the potential physical connection between FRBs and magnetars.",

This is where the \"deconvolution problem\" is defined and the degree to which that problem is either well- or ill-conditioned has direct consequences for the ultimate image fidelity that is achieved in practise. An under-utilised degree of freedom during Fourier imaging is the relative weights that are assigned to the visibility data. We explore the circumstances under which some adjustment of the relative weights might provide improvements to the \"dirty\" image, and consequently the ultimate post-deconvolution image fidelity. We develop a method to calculate a distinct effective local density estimate for each data point. When used in conjunction with a \"uniform\" weight correction and the desired clean beam (eg. Gaussian) tapering, it provides a significant improvement in the image quality over that provided by the current pixel-based density estimate. In many cases, particularly spectral-line observations and those with only limited sidereal tracking, this adaptive approach improves the beam quality by a factor of 2 to 10, as measured by the RMS residual relative to the best-fitting clean beam, providing an improvement in final image fidelity that is similar in magnitude.",

The multi-band light curve of SN 2023ixf follows a standard radioactive decay decline rate after the plateau until ~500 days, at which point shock powered emission from ongoing interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) begins to dominate. This evolution is temporally consistent with 0.3-10 keV X-ray detections of SN 2023ixf and broad ''boxy'' spectral line emission from reprocessing of shock luminosity in a cold dense shell located between forward and reverse shocks. Using the expected absorbed radioactive decay power and the detected X-ray luminosity, we quantify the total shock powered emission at the +374 and +620 day epochs and find that it can be explained by nearly complete thermalization of the reverse shock luminosity as SN 2023ixf interacts with a continuous, ''wind-like'' CSM with a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\\dot M \\approx 10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w = 20 \\pm 5$ km/s). Additionally, we construct multi-epoch spectral models from the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN, which contain radioactive decay and shock powers, as well as dust absorption, scattering, and emission. We find that models with shock powers of $L_{sh} = (0.5-1) \\times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $(0.5 - 1) \\times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\\odot}$ of silicate dust in the cold dense shell and/or inner SN ejecta can effectively reproduce the global properties of the late-time (>300 days) UV-to-IR spectra of SN 2023ixf.",

        "abstract": "Doppler Imaging (DI) is a well-established technique to map a physical field at a stellar surface from a time series of high-resolution spectra. In this proof-of-concept study, we aim to show that traditional DI algorithms, originally designed for rapidly-rotating stars, have also the ability to model the activity of Sun-like stars, when observed with new-generation highly-stable spectrographs, and search for low-mass planets around them. We used DI to retrieve the relative brightness distribution at the surface of the Sun from radial velocity (RV) observations collected by HARPS-N between 2022 and 2024. The brightness maps obtained with DI have a typical angular resolution of about 36 degrees and are a good match to low-resolution disc-resolved Dopplergrams of the Sun at epochs when the absolute, disc-integrated RV exceeds ~2 m/s. The RV residuals after DI correction exhibit a dispersion of about 0.6 m/s, comparable with existing state-of-the-art activity correction techniques. Using planet injection-recovery tests, we also show that DI can be a powerful tool for blind planet searches, so long as the orbital period is larger than ~100days (i.e. 3 to 4 stellar rotation periods), and that it yields planetary mass estimates with an accuracy comparable to, for example, multi-dimensional Gaussian process regression. Finally, we highlight some limitations of traditional DI algorithms, which should be addressed to make DI a reliable alternative to state-of-the-art RV-based planet search techniques.",

        "abstract": "The energy that heats the magnetically closed solar corona originates in the complex motions of the massive photosphere. Turbulent photospheric convection slowly displaces the footpoints of coronal field lines, causing them to become twisted and tangled. Magnetic stresses gradually build until reaching a breaking point when the field reconnects and releases a sudden burst of energy. We simulate this basic picture of nanoflares using a high-fidelity, three-dimensional, multi-stranded magnetohydrodynamic simulation that starts with a fully stratified atmosphere. This simulation includes the effects of field-aligned thermal conduction and optically thin radiation and uses the state-of-the-art Transition Region Adaptive Conduction (TRAC) method to capture the response of the plasma to the nanoflare heating. We find that our physical model supports a unified explanation for both the diffuse emission observed in active regions and the bright coronal loops. Specifically, our results suggest that the diffuse emission originates from spatially and temporally uncorrelated nanoflares, whereas coherent clusters of nanoflares - nanoflare storms - are responsible for the formation of bright coronal loops. Quantitative comparisons between the simulated emission and observed characteristics of coronal loops show that key observed properties - such as loop widths, lifetimes and cross sections - are reasonably well reproduced by the model. The idea that avalanche spread naturally leads to circular cross sections in coronal loops is strongly supported. Our results also suggest that phase differences in heating and cooling events across neighboring magnetic flux strands are a plausible explanation for the anomalous cross-field motions of coronal loops that were recently reported in high-resolution observations.",

In this work, we propose a wavelet-based approach for fast PSD estimation of both stationary and non-stationary noise. For stationary noise, we apply wavelet smoothing to the periodogram, avoiding the segmentation step in the Welch method, and enabling PSD estimates with high frequency resolution and low variance. The wavelet smoothing PSD outperforms Welch PSD in matched filtering and parameter estimation. For non-stationary noise, we estimate the PSD by taking the median of wavelet packet coefficients in each frequency bin, which offers greater robustness than the traditional median periodogram method.

        "abstract": "Recent observations and simulations indicate that solar flares undergo extremely complex three-dimensional (3D) evolution, making 3D particle transport models essential for understanding electron acceleration and interpreting flare emissions. In this study, we investigate this problem by solving Parker's transport equation with 3D MHD simulations of solar flares. By examining energy conversion in the 3D system, we evaluate the roles of different acceleration mechanisms, including reconnection current sheet (CS), termination shock (TS), and supra-arcade downflows (SADs). We find that large-amplitude turbulent fluctuations are generated and sustained in the 3D system. The model results demonstrate that a significant number of electrons are accelerated to hundreds of keV and even a few MeV, forming power-law energy spectra. These energetic particles are widely distributed, with concentrations at the TS and in the flare looptop region, consistent with results derived from recent hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave (MW) observations. By selectively turning particle acceleration on or off in specific regions, we find that the CS and SADs effectively accelerate electrons to several hundred keV, while the TS enables further acceleration to MeV. However, no single mechanism can independently account for the significant number of energetic electrons observed. Instead, the mechanisms work synergistically to produce a large population of accelerated electrons. Our model provides spatially and temporally resolved electron distributions in the whole flare region and at the flare footpoints, enabling synthetic HXR and MW emission modeling for comparison with observations. These results offer important insights into electron acceleration and transport in 3D solar flare regions.",

Furthermore, the center of mass energy of such scatterings can reach $ \\sqrt{s} \\sim 10-100$ TeV, where the proton-neutrino cross section may be enhanced by new physics such as extra-dimensional theories.

        "abstract": "Infrared spectra of hydrocarbon dust absorption bands toward the bright hypergiant Cygnus OB2-12 are compared to published spectra of the Quintuplet Cluster, a sightline to the Galactic center. The Cyg OB2-12 data include a new ground-based 2.86-3.70 microns spectrum and a previously published, but here further analyzed, spectrum of the 5.50-7.34 microns region. Higher spectral resolution data for the Cyg OB2-12 sightline in the 3 micron region allows a detailed comparison of the 3.4 micron aliphatic bands to those observed toward the Quintuplet. Despite differences in interstellar environments along each sightline, strong similarities are observed in the central wavelengths and relative strengths for bands at 3.3, 3.4, 5.85, 6.2, and 6.85 microns. Analysis of these bands, produced by aromatic, aliphatic, olefinic, hydrogenated, and oxygenated components, shows that carbonaceous dust is a significant component of the diffuse interstellar medium, second in abundance only to silicates, and is primarily aromatic in nature. The grains producing these bands likely consist of large aromatic carbon cores with thin aliphatic mantles composed of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC). Laboratory analog spectra reproduce the observed aliphatic absorption bands well, supporting the presence of such mantles. We present evidence that the carriers of both the 3.4 micron aliphatic and the 3.3 micron aromatic bands reside exclusively in the diffuse ISM, and that the 3.3 micron bands observed in the diffuse ISM differ from those seen in dense clouds, implying chemically distinct carriers.",

A significant fraction (~30%) of massive stars in our Galaxy are moving supersonically through the interstellar medium, which strongly governs their location at the time they end their lives, e.g. die as a supernova and give birth to a supernova remnant (SNR). These dead stellar environments accelerate particles, emitting by non-thermal mechanisms up to the TeV range, and they are considered as a major contributor to the very-high-energy band of the local cosmic-ray spectrum.   Aims. This study investigates the effect of the runaway motion of supernova progenitors on the spatial distribution of SNRs in the Milky Way and how this influences the deduced properties of the population.   Methods. We construct Galactic populations of SNRs by Monte Carlo simulation, taking into account the bulk motion and the evolution history of their progenitor stars once ejected from their parent clusters. The gamma-ray domain emission of each population is then calculated, to be compared with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Galactic Plane Survey.   Results. We find that including the runaway motion of supernova progenitors strongly modifies the detectability of the simulated emission of their remnants in the very-high-energy band. Particularly, our best fit model using a Reid Milky Way model for core-collapse supernova progenitors requires 33% of massive runaway stars, which is close to the known fraction of runaway high-mass stars, to be in accordance with the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey data.   Conclusions. Our results show that the runaway nature of supernova progenitors must be taken into account in the study of the Galactic population of SNRs within the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey and the forthcoming Galactic Plane Survey of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, as it is a governing factor of the detectability of non-thermal emission of their subsequent SNRs.",

Extragalactic point sources become a major source of contamination after delensing and can bias estimates of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ at the $10^{-3}$ level. We introduce Generalized Point Spread Function Fitting (GPSF), a method for removing point-source contamination in polarization maps. GPSF uses the full pixel-domain covariance, including off-diagonal terms, and models overlapping sources. This allows accurate flux estimation under realistic conditions, particularly for small-aperture telescopes with large beams that are more susceptible to source blending. We test GPSF on simulated sky maps, apply foreground cleaning using the Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC) method, and compare its performance with standard masking and inpainting. The results show GPSF reduces point-source contamination without significantly affecting the background signal, as seen in both the maps and their power spectra. For the constraint on $r$, GPSF reduces the bias from $1.67 \\times 10^{-3}$ to $2.9 \\times 10^{-4}$, with only a 2% increase in standard deviation. Compared to inpainting and masking, GPSF yields lower bias while maintaining comparable variance. This suggests that it may serve as a promising method for future CMB experiments targeting measurements of $r \\sim 10^{-3}$.",

Specifically, we analyze variations of the azimuthal angle with respect to the acceleration, examine changes in energy per enthalpy of decelerated plasma, and plot energy extraction efficiency along with permissible energy extraction regions. Results show that in the plunging region, at larger radii of reconnection locations, the accelerating black hole exhibits higher energy extraction efficiency than a Kerr black hole. Away from extremality, the acceleration parameter impedes energy extraction, while near extremality, it enhances extraction. We also study energy extraction in circular orbit region by plotting energy extraction efficiency within permissible regions. We find that the permissible energy extraction area is reduced and the efficiency exceeds that of Kerr black holes due to the existence of acceleration parameter. Larger acceleration parameters yield more effective energy extraction regardless of extremality, which is different from that in the plunging region. Additionally, energy extraction efficiency in the plunging region surpasses that in the circular orbit region, aligning with prior conclusions.",

These events offer an opportunity to constrain the presence of possible initial (residual) orbital eccentricities while using purely inspiral template families. We detail the implementation of a LSC Algorithm Library Suite approximant, TaylorF2Ecck, which models analytically inspiral gravitational waves from non-spinning compact binaries in Post-Newtonian accurate eccentric orbits while restricting the initial-eccentricity contributions to its leading order. Specifically, our frequency domain approximant consistently incorporates the orbital, advance of periastron, and gravitational-wave emission effects fully up to the 3PN order. We pursue detailed parameter estimation studies of GW170817 and GW190425 using TaylorF2Ecck, after performing comprehensive sanity checks to validate the model's performance and investigate the influence of periastron advance in the relevant parameter space. The results indicate that initial-eccentricity at 20 Hz is essentially zero (less than 0.011 for GW170817 and less than 0.028 for GW190425) at a 90 percent confidence level. We compare posteriors for these two events that arise from a few purely inspiral eccentric approximants and point out certain subtle effects arising due to the inclusion of periastron advance. Additionally, these detailed studies reveal the importance of incorporating initial eccentricity contributions at least up to 3.5PN-order and discuss its implications. We substantiate this inference by employing versions of quasi-circular TaylorF2 approximant that incorporate Fourier phase contributions beyond the conventional 3.5PN order.",

However, there is a list of puzzles for this magnetar-for-all-FRBs scenario: known Galactic magnetars are all isolated and none of them are active repeaters; some cosmological repeaters have extremely high repetition rates but without any measurable spin-related periodicity; some show long-term periodic active windows; and some show diverse rotation measure (RM) evolution patterns, such as quasi-periodic fluctuations, sign reversals, and abrupt RM flares. Here we propose a unified theoretical framework for FRBs within the framework of magnetar engine: Most active repeating FRBs originate from magnetars in binary systems with nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes, some of which with a triple-aligned geometry, i.e. with an alignment with the orbital axis as well; whereas apparent non-repeaters and inactive repeaters originate from magnetars in isolated systems or in binaries with a misaligned geometry. By studying various magnetar formation channels using population syntheses, we show that a few percent of magnetars in the universe can be in binary systems, most with a massive star companion and some with aligned geometry. We suggest that such binary systems can account for the rich phenomenology of active repeaters. We suggest that the existence of a companion helps to maintain the aligned geometry and that the companion may play an active role in triggering FRBs in an active repeater source.",

After its launch into an equatorial Low Earth Orbit (LEO) in 2027, COSI will experience radiation damage primarily due to energetic protons, with the proton fluence dominated by the passage of COSI through the edge of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) for a few minutes each orbit. We have developed a comprehensive program focused on the modeling, characterization, data correction, and physical repair of radiation damage effects in the COSI detectors. We have performed energetic proton beam irradiations of a spare COSI detector at a proton synchrotron, with proton fluences consistent with multiple years of exposure to the COSI space radiation environment. These exposures allow us to characterize the relationship between proton fluence and induced charge trapping. We demonstrate our techniques to correct for trapping effects, as well as characterize the effectiveness of high-temperature annealing on correcting this damage, as characterized by the resulting spectral performance of the detector. We will present our efforts to characterize the effects of radiation damage in the COSI detectors, as well as our techniques for correcting these effects in the data analysis pipeline and ultimately repairing the detectors on orbit every few years through high-temperature annealing.",

Although initially analyzed after detection, the event has recently gained renewed attention following a study, Morras et al.

In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of GW200105 using state-of-the-art effective-one-body waveform models. Importantly, we present the first study of this event utilizing a physically complete model that incorporates both orbital eccentricity and spin precession across the full inspiral, merger, and ringdown stages, along with higher-order gravitational wave modes. Our results support the presence of eccentricity in the signal, with zero eccentricity excluded from $99\\%$ credible interval, but yield a mass ratio closer to the original LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analysis, differing from the findings of Morras et al. (2025). Additionally, similar to previous eccentric-only analysis Planas et al. (2025), we observe a multimodal structure in the eccentricity posterior distribution. We conduct targeted investigations to understand the origin of this multimodality and complement our analysis with numerical relativity simulations to examine how the inclusion of eccentricity impacts the merger dynamics.",

First, we train a physics-informed neural network to learn the solution of the Friedmann equation and accurately reproduce the matter density term x_m(z) = Omega_m,0 (1+z)^3 across a range of Omega_m,0. For each of five two-parameter equation-of-state (EoS) forms: Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Linear-z, and Logarithmic-z, we derive the analytic dark energy factor x_de(z), embed the trained surrogate within a GPU-accelerated likelihood pipeline, and sample the posterior of (h0, Omega_m,0, w0, wa, M0) using the emcee ensemble sampler with the full Pantheon+ covariance. All parameterizations remain consistent with a cosmological constant (w0 = -1, wa = 0) at the 95% credible level, with the tightest bounds from the CPL form. While the surrogate does not reduce computation time for a single run in simple models, it becomes advantageous for repeated analyses of the same EoS or for models with expensive likelihood evaluations, and can be shared as a reusable tool with different datasets within the training range of SNe redshifts. This flexibility makes the approach a scalable tool for future cosmological inference, especially in regimes where conventional ODE-based methods are computationally prohibitive.",

        "abstract": "Context: Magnetic fields play a pivotal role in dynamics of black hole accretion flows and formation of relativistic jets. Observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provided unprecedented insights into accretion structures near black holes. Interpreting these observations requires a theoretical framework linking polarized emission to underlying system properties and magnetic field geometries. Aims: We investigate how system properties, particularly magnetic field geometry in the event horizon scale region, influence the structure of the observable synchrotron emission in M87*. Specifically, we aim to quantify the sensitivity of observables used by the EHT to black hole spin, plasma dynamics, accretion disk thickness, and magnetic field geometry. Methods: We adopt a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient accretion flow model in Kerr spacetime. We vary magnetic field geometry, black hole spin, accretion disk dynamics, and geometric thickness of the disk. We perform general relativistic ray tracing with a full polarized radiative transfer to obtain synthetic images of M87*. We extract EHT observables, such as disk diameter, asymmetry, and polarimetric metrics from synthetic models. We also consider a number of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations and compare them with the semi-analytical models. Results: We see limited impact of the disk thickness on observables. On the other hand, toroidal field dominated and poloidal field dominated magnetic configurations can be distinguished reliably. The flow dynamics, in particular presence of radial inflow, also significantly impacts the EHT observables. Conclusions: The M87* system is most consistent with a poloidal magnetic field dominated flow with partially radial inflow. While the spin remain elusive, moderate or large positive values are preferred.",

Hence, we detail a modification to the radiatively-cooled Sweet-Parker model developed by Uzdensky & McKinney (2011) to allow for varying current sheet length. The steady-state solution shows that when radiative cooling dominates compressional heating, the current sheet length is shorter than the system size, with an increased reconnection rate compared to the classical Sweet-Parker rate. The model and subsequent results lay out the groundwork for a more complete theoretical understanding of magnetic reconnection in regimes dominated by optically thin radiative cooling.",

We introduce the general model for double level crossings, along with several toy examples, and redefine the light and heavy axion scenarios. In the light axion scenario, double level crossings can occur multiple times in the large ${\\mathcal N}$ limit. However, excessively large values of ${\\mathcal N}$ may also prevent the occurrence of double level crossings.

        "abstract": "Solar flare ribbons are believed to map the footpoints of newly reconnected magnetic flux tubes, therefore shedding light on the reconnecting current sheet, which is rarely observed by direct imaging or spectroscopy. Here we study the detailed evolution of flare ribbons down to the arcsecond scale for 10 flares characterized by the classic double ribbons. Identifying the flaring pixels by combining the intensity variances of the UV filter ratio and intensity threshold, we found that the waiting time distributions of the flaring pixels are well described by power laws, distinct from those in the preflare or quiet-Sun regions, and that the power-law slopes are generally consistent with those predicted by nonstationary Poisson processes in the nonlinear regime or by the 2D/3D self-organized criticality (SOC) model. The size distributions for flaring duration also follow power laws but the slopes are more scattered. In contrast, the size distributions for other parameters, including peak intensity, energy, and radial magnetic field strength of the flaring pixels, deviate from power laws, and the estimated slopes significantly differ from the SOC predictions. These results suggest that a nonstationary Poisson process or an avalanche-like process might be ongoing in the temporal dimension in the reconnecting current sheet, but in other aspects, e.g., space- and energy-wise, the avalanche is likely modulated by other physical processes or the fine structures of the reconnecting current sheet.",

Meeting the scientific requirements of modern instruments demands detector systems that provide high spatial and spectral resolution across large detection areas, with strict limits on power consumption and mass. These needs drive innovation in front-end electronics and mixed-signal processing to support compact detector electrode geometries. Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are essential in front-end readout electronics, enabling high-channel-density and low-power systems, while maintaining low-noise performance suitable for space-based instruments and balloon-borne payloads. The NRL4 (Naval Research Laboratory 4) is a recently developed 32-channel front-end ASIC featuring low-power, low-noise channels consisting of charge-sensitive preamplifiers, 4 configurable gain settings, dual configurable shapers for optimized timing and energy resolution, trimmable per-channel discrimination, time-to-analog conversion, and peak-detect output. The NRL4 has been integrated with a high-purity germanium (HPGe) dual-sided strip detector with a 1.16 mm strip pitch. Energy resolution of 3 keV full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 59.54 keV was achieved with a gain of 18.4 mV/fC and a slow shaper peaking time of 2 {\\mu}s. Preliminary results from ongoing research demonstrate the suitability of the NRL4 for high-resolution, low-power gamma-ray spectroscopy for ground and space-based missions.",

We consider a scenario in which a heavy scalar field, $\\phi$, dominates the energy density of the early Universe and decays into heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The subsequent decay of RHNs generates a lepton asymmetry, which is partially converted into the observed baryon asymmetry via the sphaleron process. The $\\phi$-dominated era and the entropy injection from the decays of $\\phi$ and RHNs leave characteristic imprints on the GW spectrum, such as damping and modified frequency dependence, that distinguish it from the standard cosmological evolution. We identify the parameter space in which non-thermal leptogenesis is successful, leading to distinctive GW spectral features. We show that these GW signals can fall within the sensitivity ranges of future detectors such as ET, DECIGO and BBO.

In this paper, we focus on GRB 110213A that shows double-peaked optical afterglow lightcurves and the shallow decay feature of the X-ray afterglow. We adopt a semi-analytic model for the dynamics of forward and reverse shocks generated through an interaction between an arbitrary magnetized ejecta with a finite thickness and a stratified circumstellar medium. Multiwavelength radiation from forward and reverse shocks seen from an arbitrary viewing angle is calculated under a thin-shell approximation. Our analysis with multimodal nested sampling methods for GRB 110213A suggests that the thick shell ejecta naturally explains the shallow decay feature of the X-ray afterglow. The combination of the reverse shock emission in the strongly magnetized jet and forward shock emission in the weakly magnetized circumstellar medium makes the double peak feature of the optical afterglows. The estimated low radiative efficiency in the prompt phase may be a consequence of the high magnetization of the jet in this case.

The ever-present counter-streaming flows observed within the filament are identified as interleaved unidirectional mass flows in opposing directions occurring in neighboring threads. Multi-wavelength observations corroborate the multi-thermal nature of these counter-streaming flows: the cool H$\\alpha$ component flows at about 10--20 km s$^{-1}$, while the warm ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet components reach 40--70 km s$^{-1}$. The Si~{\\sc iv} 1400~{\\AA} line reveals significant micro-turbulence in the filament's counter-streaming flows, with a nonthermal velocity width of 40 km s$^{-1}$. These multi-thermal flows emanate from compact brightenings at the filament's ends, manifesting as small-scale, collimated upflows at their nascent phase. They continuously inject both chromospheric and transition region plasma into the filament channel, thereby feeding the counter-streaming flows. At their base, the Si~{\\sc iv} and C~{\\sc ii} spectral lines show pronounced line broadening and intensity enhancements, indicating significant localized chromospheric heating. Additionally, numerous small-scale photospheric flux emergence and cancellation events, with magnitude of $10^{17}$~Mx, are detected near their base. We suggest such weak magnetic-field activities, possibly associated with unresolved magnetic reconnection events, drive these persistent upflows and localized footpoint heating. This work elucidates the multi-thermal origin of counter-streaming flows within a forming filament and provides evidence of localized chromospheric heating at the filament footpoints.",

        "abstract": "Cygnus X-1 is a persistent, high-mass black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) which in the hard state shows many similar properties to transient BHXRBs, along with intriguing differences, such as the lack of quasi-periodic oscillations. Here, we compare for the first time the detailed spectral-timing properties of Cyg X-1 with a transient BHXRB, MAXI J1820+070, combining data from XMM-Newton and NICER with contemporaneous INTEGRAL data to study the power spectra, rms spectra and time-lags over a broad 0.5 - 200 keV range. We select bright hard state MAXI J1820+070 data with similar power-spectral shapes to the Cyg X-1 data, to compare the source behaviours while accounting for the evolution of spectral-timing properties, notably the lags, through the hard state. Cyg X-1 shows no evidence for soft lags in the 1 - 10 Hz frequency range where they are clearly detected for MAXI J1820+070. Furthermore the low-frequency hard lags and rms-spectra evolve much more strongly during the hard state of Cyg X-1 than for MAXI J1820+070. We argue that these differences cannot be explained by the different black hole masses of these systems, but may be related to their different accretion rates and corresponding locations on the hardness-intensity diagram. We conjecture that there is a significant luminosity-dependence of coronal geometry in the hard state of BHXRBs, rather than an intrinsic difference between Cyg X-1 and transient BHXRBs. This possibility has also been suggested to explain a common time-lag feature that appears in the hard intermediate states of Cyg X-1 and transient BHXRBs.",

Employing the Geant4 simulation toolkit and a simplified model of the detector to generate training and test data, we achieve the spectroscopic capabilities required for an accurate determination of the biologically relevant dose that astronauts receive in space. We can reconstruct a particle's trajectory with an angular resolution of better than $1.4^\\circ$ and achieve a charge separation of better than $95\\%$ for nuclei with $Z\\leq8$; specifically, we reach an accuracy of $99.8\\%$ for hydrogen. The energy resolution is $<20\\%$ for energies below 1 GeV/n and elements up to iron. We also discuss the limitations of our detector, the reconstruction framework, and this feasibility study, as well as possible improvements.",

        "abstract": "Some planetary nebulae (PNe) host X-ray-emitting hot bubbles shaped by stellar wind interactions and/or harbor X-ray-emitting central stars due to accretion, shocks within their fast stellar winds, or even chromospheric emission from binary companions. In both cases, the properties of the X-ray emission critically probe late-stages of stellar evolution for such low- and intermediate-mass stars. While extant Chandra and XMM-Newton observations have detected X-ray emission in PNe, the numbers known remain very small ($\\sim40$) compared to the overall Galactic PNe population ($\\sim4000$). We have initiated a project aimed at increasing the sample of known PNe with X-ray emission using both current and new space-based X-ray telescopes such as the Einstein probe. To further investigate their X-ray properties to elucidate what drives current X-ray PN detections, we have cross-searched the SRG {\\it eROSITA-DE} eRASS1 source catalogue and Hong Kong (HASH) PNe Database. Five known X-ray PNe have been detected (Abell\\,30, NGC\\,2392, NGC\\,3242, NGC\\,5315, and LoTr\\,5), two new X-ray PNe are revealed (IC\\,1297 and NGC\\,2867), one (K\\,1-27) is removed from previous X-ray compilations, and another 11 previously detected X-ray emitting PNe are not recovered. A comparison of the X-ray flux of detected and undetected X-ray PNe reveals that eROSITA eRASS1 is sensitive to PNe with X-ray fluxes larger than $\\approx2\\times10^{-14}$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The frequency of occurrence is $\\simeq$0.5\\% among the 1430 HASH True PNe in the eRASS1 footprint.",

        "abstract": "We perform a comprehensive study of thermonuclear bursts from the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1702-429 detected with NICER and XMM-Newton. The thermonuclear burst detected with NICER shows clear evidence of a photospheric radius expansion (PRE) event and a distinct feature in the burst profile. The burst profiles demonstrate significant energy dependence, with the hardness ratio varying notably during the PRE phase. The radius of the neutron star photosphere expanded to a maximum of $23.1_{-3.2}^{+3.8}$ km while its temperature reached a minimum of 1.4 keV. The time-resolved burst spectra can be modeled using variable persistent emission method, indicating that the soft excess may arise from enhanced mass accretion onto the neutron star, potentially due to the Poynting-Robertson drag. Alternatively, the disk reflection model can be used to explain the soft excess emission during a burst. The time-resolved spectral study is performed for three thermonuclear bursts detected with XMM-Newton. The XMM-Newton time-resolved burst spectra can be modeled using an absorbed blackbody model, without any signatures of the PRE. We conduct a detailed spectral analysis of the 2025 NuSTAR observation of 4U 1702-429, revealing a broad iron line at 6.4 keV and a Compton hump around 20 keV, indicating X-ray reflection features. The disk reflection model relxill provides an inner disk radius of 12 $R_g$ and an inclination angle of $\\sim39^{\\circ}$. The magnetic field strength at the pole of the neutron star is estimated to be 5.1 $\\times10^8$ G, assuming that the accretion disk is truncated at magnetosphere boundary.",

The spatial power spectra of the horizontal-flow divergence reveal well-defined characteristic scales of solar supergranulation in the upper 4 Mm layer, while the giant-cell scale is prominent below levels of d ~ 8 Mm. We find that the characteristic scales of supergranulation remain stable while the giant scales increase during the periods of the 11-year activity cycle maxima. The power of the giant-cell scales increases with the enhancement of solar activity. This may be due to large-scale flows around active regions and, presumably, solar-cycle variations of the convection-zone stratification.",

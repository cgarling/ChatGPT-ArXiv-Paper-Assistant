SPARCS enables on-the-fly radiation hydrodynamics simulations, with multi-frequency ultraviolet radiative transfer coupled with all ionisation states of 11 major elements, in the presence of dust, cosmic ray ionization and heating, and self-gravity. Direct radiation pressure on gas and dust is also accounted for. We validate SPARCS against analytic solutions and standard photo-ionization codes such as CLOUDY in idealized tests. As an example application, we simulate an ionization front propagating through an inhomogeneous interstellar medium with solar metallicity. We produce mock optical emission line observations with the level population calculation code HyLight and the diagnostic radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that non-equilibrium effects and inhomogeneities can boost the low ion fractions by up to an order of magnitude. Possible applications of SPARCS include studying the dynamical impact of radiation on gas in star-forming regions, and in the interstellar and circumgalactic medium, as well as interpreting line diagnostics in such environments, and galactic or AGN outflows.",

Our sample consists primarily of binaries with short-period, circular orbits and often manifest as high-mass ratio \"twin\" M&Ms. We find that M&Ms do not exhibit an overdensity of contact binaries, which is different from previous results for solar-type binaries. Further, we find a tidal circularization period of approximately 2.7 days, which is significantly shorter compared to the literature value of 7 days.

        "abstract": "Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically generated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a correlated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the Zel'dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point statistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces subtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These anisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through directional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances. Analyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with varying resolutions, initial redshifts, and box sizes, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but are amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that persist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our findings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts -- emerging from the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice -- not genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model. These results underscore the importance of critically reassessing how initial conditions are constructed, particularly when probing the large-scale, quasi-linear regime of structure formation.",

By applying typical scalings from the cold neutral medium to simulations, we find that shocks moving into turbulence on the scale of superbubbles can generate compressive flows on the order of $10^{3} M_{\\odot}$/Myr.

Of the 64 galaxies detected in the cluster, we successfully modelled 16, while the remaining galaxies exhibit disturbed HI morphologies, insufficient angular or velocity resolution. We combine the galaxies with converged kinematic fits with 67 field galaxies from the MeerKAT spectral line survey early science data ($\\langle$z$\\rangle$ = 0.0435) to produce a measurement of the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (bTFr) that encompasses a broader range of environment and provides a useful comparison. We find a slope ($\\alpha$ = 3.66$^{+0.32}_{-0.28}$) for this relation, which is consistent with that found from the MIGHTEE bTFr derived from the same definition. Interestingly, HI detections of the Abell 3408 galaxy cluster galaxies are seen to extend the bTFr of the MIGHTEE sample, both in mass and velocity, despite their cluster environment.",

In this work, we constrain the 21-cm signal and infer IGM properties by leveraging multi-wavelength synergies. This builds on our earlier study, where we developed the synergy between high-redshift UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), cosmic X-ray and radio backgrounds (CXB and CRB), 21-cm global signal non-detection from SARAS~3, and 21-cm power spectrum upper limits from HERA, to constrain the astrophysical properties of Population II galaxies.

The aperture-mass skewness is a compressed representation of three-point shear information, designed to capture non-Gaussian features while keeping the data vector computationally tractable. We find that including the aperture-mass skewness improves the $S_8$-$\\Omega_m$ figure of merit by 80% compared to the 2PCF-only case, primarily due to the breaking of degeneracies. Our joint analysis yields a constraint of $S_8=0.736\\pm0.020$, which is slightly lower than the two-point-only result and increases the tension with Planck 2018 to 3.2$\\sigma$ in the $S_8$-$\\Omega_m$ plane. The two- and three-point statistics are found to be internally consistent across redshift bins and angular scales, and we detect no significant intrinsic alignment signal. We also explore extensions to the $w$CDM model and find no evidence for deviations from a cosmological constant. This work demonstrates the feasibility and scientific value of incorporating third-order shear statistics into weak lensing cosmology and provides a practical pathway for similar analyses in future Stage-IV surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman.",

        "abstract": "Inferring astrophysical parameters from radio interferometric observations of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a challenging yet crucial task. The 21-cm signal from EoR is expected to be highly non-Gaussian; therefore, we need to use higher-order statistics, e.g., bispectrum. Moreover, the forward modeling of the signal and its statistics for a varying set of model parameters requires rerunning the simulations many times, which is computationally very expensive. To overcome this challenge, many artificial neural network (ANN) based emulators have been introduced, which produce the 21-cm summaries in a fraction of the time. However, ANN emulators have a drawback: they can only produce point-value predictions; thus, they fail to capture the uncertainty associated with their predictions. Therefore, when such emulators are used in the Bayesian inference pipeline, they cannot naturally propagate their prediction uncertainties to the estimated model parameters. To address this problem, we have developed Bayesian neural network (BNN) emulators for the 21-cm signal statistics, which provide the posterior distribution of the predicted signal statistics, including their prediction uncertainty. We use these BNN emulators in our Bayesian inference pipeline to infer the EoR parameters through 21-cm summaries of the mock observation of 21-cm signal with telescopic noise for $1000$ hr of SKA-LOW observation. We show that BNN emulators can capture the prediction uncertainty for the 21-cm power spectrum and bispectrum, and using these emulators in the inference pipeline provides better and tighter constraints on them. We reduced the training dataset and showed that, for smaller training datasets, BNN outperforms the ANN emulators. We also show that using the bispectrum as a summary statistic gives better constraints on EoR parameters than the power spectrum.",

        "abstract": "Ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) are a subclass of low-mass X-ray binaries characterized by tight orbits and degenerate donors, which pose significant challenges to our understanding of their formation. Recent discoveries of black hole (BH) candidates with main-sequence (MS) or red giant (RG) companions suggest that BH-white dwarf (BH-WD) binaries are common in the Galactic field. Motivated by these observations and the fact that most massive stars are born in triples, we show that wide BH-WD systems can naturally form UCXBs through the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. Notably, EKL-driven eccentricity excitations combined with gravitational wave (GW) emission and WD dynamical tides can effectively shrink and circularize the orbit, leading to mass-transferring BH-WD binaries. These systems represent promising multimessenger sources in both X-ray and GW observations. Specifically, we predict that the wide triple channel can produce $\\sim5-45$ ($\\sim1-8$) detectable UCXBs in the Milky Way (Andromeda galaxy), including $\\sim1$ system observable by the mHz GW detection of LISA. If the final WD mass can reach sufficiently small values, this channel could contribute up to $\\sim 10^3$ UCXBs in the Galaxy. Furthermore, the identification of tertiary companions in observed UCXBs would provide direct evidence for this formation pathway and yield unique insights into their dynamical origins.",

Our goal is to build a high-purity, high-completeness, all-sky galaxy catalog out to 2,000 Mpc, specifically designed to support time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. We combined major galaxy catalogs and deep imaging surveys -- including the Legacy Surveys, Pan-STARRS, DELVE, and SDSS -- and added spectroscopic, photometric, and redshift-independent distances. We cleaned the sample using the Gaia catalog to remove stars, and visually inspected all ambiguous cases below 100 Mpc through a classification platform that gathered 20,000 expert votes. Stellar masses were estimated using optical and mid-infrared profile-fit photometry, and we improved the accuracy of photometric distances by combining multiple independent estimates. The resulting catalog, REGALADE, includes nearly 80 million galaxies with distances under 2,000 Mpc. It provides stellar masses for 88\\% of the sample and ellipse fits for 80\\%. REGALADE is more than 90\\% complete for massive galaxies out to 360 Mpc.

If compact dark matter (DM) candidates, e.g. primordial black holes, contribute a substantial fraction of the DM component across a broad mass spectrum, their gravitational influence would imprint distinctive micro-lensing signatures on long-wavelength GW signals. In this paper, we propose a systematic method ranging from simulating micro-lensing GWs to constraining population information of compact DM, combining future third-generation ground-based GW detector, i.e. Einstein Telescope, with a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework. This approach enables us to analyze micro-lensing signatures in GW events and probe the potential contribution of compact DM objects to the DM budget of universe. For a population with a power-law mass function, we demonstrate that detecting 8 micro-lensing GW events out of $10^4$ observed binary black holes would constrain the compact DM abundance to $\\log_{10}(f_{\\rm CO})=-2.76^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$.",

        "abstract": "The 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen is a promising probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) but suffers from contamination by spectrally smooth foregrounds, which obscure the large-scale signal along the line of sight. We explore the possibility of indirectly extracting the 21 cm signal in the presence of foregrounds by taking advantage of nonlinear couplings between large and small scales, both at the level of the density field and a biased tracer of that field. When combined with effective field theory techniques, bias expansions allow for a systematic treatment of nonlinear mode-couplings in the map between the underlying density field and the 21 cm field. We apply an effective bias expansion to density information generated with $\\texttt{21cmFAST}$ using a variety of assumptions about which information can be recovered by different surveys and density estimation techniques. We find that the 21 cm signal produced by our effective bias expansion, combined with our least optimistic foreground assumptions, produces ~30% cross-correlations with the true 21 cm field. Providing complementary density information from high-redshift galaxy surveys yields a cross-correlation of 50-70%. The techniques presented here may be combined with foreground mitigation strategies in order to improve the recovery of the large-scale 21 cm signal.",

        "abstract": "Gravity in nonlinear and dynamical regimes underpins spectacular astrophysical phenomena and observable consequences, from the early universe to black hole collisions. In these extreme environments, inverse energy cascades - mediated by nonlinear interactions - may help explain the near scale-invariance of cosmic structure and the simplicity of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Yet the presence, characteristics, and generality of such interactions in full General Relativity remain largely unexplored. Here we show that two types of nonlinear interactions - a four-mode and a three-mode interaction - emerge in the fully nonlinear regime, and can indeed channel inverse energy cascades by inducing resonant and anti-damping instabilities. This establishes what was previously only hinted at in highly specialized perturbative contexts. We further demonstrate a ``laminar'' to ``turbulent'' transition for the largest-possible angular structure in General Relativity, whereas finer structures remain persistently turbulent. Our results reveal the impact and generality of these nonlinear interactions (instabilities), which can be key to understanding observations ranging from cosmological to kilometer scales. We anticipate that our work will shed new light on nonlinear gravitational phenomena and their consequences, such as constructing gravitational wave templates and testing General Relativity in the most extreme regime. Moreover, our work is a starting point for addressing nonlinear gravitational interactions using ideas and methods inspired by fluid dynamics.",

The resulting shock heating and compression encourage starburst activities, which subsequently photo-ionize the gas into HII, that in turn shines into the rest-optical via bremsstrahlung radiation within the minimal-timescale-cutoff (i.e., red) regime, before escaping back into the intergalactic space, propelled by the newly fusion-injected energy.",

Typically, our compact groups have a median characteristic size of $\\sim$$150$ kpc, 1D velocity dispersions of $150 ~ {\\rm km ~ s^{-1}}$, and stellar masses around $2\\times 10^{11} ~ M_{\\odot}$. Roughly 1\\% of galaxies of stellar mass above $10^9 ~ M_{\\odot}$ lie in physically dense compact groups. We found that these systems do not constitute a separate category within the broader population of galaxy groups; instead, they represent the lower end of the size distribution in the sequence of galaxy group sizes. We traced their evolution backward in time, revealing that they initially form as galaxies systems with a mean low surface brightness that systematically increases to a peak value before stabilizing over time, exhibiting oscillatory behaviour over the following several Gyrs during which mergers may occur. Mergers often transform compact groups with typically four members into galaxy pairs or triplets, which may eventually can increase again their number of members accreting a new galaxy. Nevertheless, the full merging of all constituent galaxies into a single massive galaxy is a rare phenomenon.",

Measuring PNG relies on evaluating the scale-dependent correlations in the density field. New summary statistics beyond the two- and three-point correlation functions in configuration space and their Fourier-space counterparts, the power- and bi-spectrum may provide increased sensitivity. We introduce a new method for extracting the PNG signal imprinted on the LSS by using the first three Gaussian moments of the normalized correlation in density perturbations, evaluated at varying distance scales. We aim to assess this method's sensitivity to local PNG, parameterized by $f_ {\\mathrm{NL}}$. We perform spherical convolutions at a range of scales on dark matter halo simulations to measure the scale-dependent correlations in the density field. From these, we compute the first three moments and compare them to a model expectation vector, parameterized to the second power in $f_{\\mathrm{NL}}$. Our method provides about 21% improvement in sensitivity to $f_{\\mathrm{NL}}$ with respect to using the two point correlation function alone. Notably, we find that the second moment alone carries nearly as much constraining power as the mean, highlighting the potential of higher-order statistics. Given its simplicity and efficiency, this framework is well-suited for application to current and upcoming large-scale surveys such as DESI.",

        "abstract": "Stellar mass is the most fundamental property of a galaxy. While it has been robustly measured for millions of external galaxies, it remains poorly constrained for the Milky Way because of the strong selection effect from our inside perspective. In this work, we reconstruct the intrinsic vertical mass density profile in the solar neighborhood and the radial mass density profile across the entire Galaxy using data from the Gaia and APOGEE surveys, following careful correction for the selection function. The local density profile exhibits strong north-south asymmetry in the geometric thick disk regime and increases steeply toward the disk mid-plane, favoring an exponential model over the sech$^2$ model. Integrating the local vertical density profile yields a surface stellar mass density of 31.563$\\pm$2.813(syst.)$\\pm$0.024(stoch.)~${\\rm M_{\\odot}pc^{-2}}$, of which 25.074 and 6.489~${\\rm M_{\\odot}pc^{-2}}$ correspond to living stars and stellar remnants, respectively. The radial surface mass density profile {of the Milky Way} shares the same flat inner component as observed in the brightness profile. With this mass density profile {and local mass density from Gaia}, we derive a new estimate of the total stellar mass of the Milky Way of 2.607$\\pm$0.353(syst.)$\\pm$0.085(stoch.)${\\rm \\times10^{10}M_{\\odot}}$, a factor of two lower than the previous results. This discrepancy arises primarily from the inner disk profile, which was previously unavailable and extrapolated from the outer disk profile. The lower stellar mass estimate of the Milky Way significantly reduces its rarity in terms of supermassive black hole mass among external galaxies and implies a larger dark matter-to-baryon mass ratio in the inner Galaxy.",

In this scenario, a stellar-mass BH binary undergoes isolated binary evolution and merges while hosting a distant, dynamically unimportant tertiary stellar companion. The tertiary becomes relevant only after the merger, when the remnant BH receives a GW recoil kick. Depending on the kick velocity and system configuration, the outcome can be: (i) a bright electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the GW merger; (ii) an LMXB; (iii) a wide BH-stellar companion resembling the Gaia BH population; or (iv) an unbound, isolated BH. Modeling the three-body dynamics, we find that $\\sim 0.02\\%$ of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) mergers may be followed by an EM counterpart within $\\sim$10 days, produced by tidal disruption of the star by the BH. The flare is likely brightest in the optical-UV and lasts days to weeks; in some cases, partial disruption causes recurring flares with a period of $\\sim$2 months. We further estimate that this channel can produce $\\sim 1-10\\%$ of Gaia BH systems in the Milky Way. This scenario provides the first physically motivated link between GW sources, Gaia BHs, and some X-ray binaries, and predicts a rare but robust pathway for EM counterparts to binary BH mergers, potentially detectable in LVK's O5 run.",

However, bright foreground contamination and the nature of radio interferometry create significant challenges, making it difficult to access rich cosmological information from the Fourier modes that lie within the \"foreground wedge\". In this work, we introduce two approaches aiming to reconstruct the full 21-cm density field, including the missing modes in the wedge: (a) a field-level inference under an effective field theory (EFT) framework; (b) a diffusion-based deep generative model trained on simulations. Under the EFT framework, we implement a fully differentiable forward model that maps the initial conditions of matter fluctuations to the observed, foreground-filtered 21-cm maps. This enables a gradient-based sampler to simultaneously sample the initial conditions and bias parameters, allowing a physically motivated mode reconstruction. Alternatively, we apply a variational diffusion model to perform 21-cm density reconstruction at the map level. Our model is trained on semi-numerical simulations over a wide range of astrophysical parameters. Our results from both approaches should provide improved cosmological constraints from the field level and also enable cross-correlation between experiments that have little or no overlapping modes.",

We perform a complete tomographic measurement of the three-point correlation function of the Y3 weak lensing shape catalog with the four fiducial source redshift bins. Building upon our companion methodology paper, we apply a pipeline that combines the two-point function $\\xi_{\\pm}$ with the mass aperture skewness statistic $\\langle M_{\\rm ap}^3\\rangle$, which is an efficient compression of the full shear three-point function. We use a suite of simulated shear maps to obtain a joint covariance matrix. By jointly analyzing $\\xi_\\pm$ and $\\langle M_{\\rm ap}^3\\rangle$ measured from DES Y3 data with a $\\Lambda$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.780\\pm0.015$ and $\\Omega_{\\rm m}=0.266^{+0.039}_{-0.040}$, yielding 111% of figure-of-merit improvement in $\\Omega_m$-$S_8$ plane relative to $\\xi_{\\pm}$ alone, consistent with expectations from simulated likelihood analyses. With a $w$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.749^{+0.027}_{-0.026}$ and $w_0=-1.39\\pm 0.31$, which gives an improvement of $22\\%$ on the joint $S_8$-$w_0$ constraint. Our results are consistent with $w_0=-1$. Our new constraints are compared to CMB data from the Planck satellite, and we find that with the inclusion of $\\langle M_{\\rm ap}^3\\rangle$ the existing tension between the data sets is at the level of $2.3\\sigma$. We show that the third-order statistic enables us to self-calibrate the mean photometric redshift uncertainty parameter of the highest redshift bin with little degradation in the figure of merit. Our results demonstrate the constraining power of higher-order lensing statistics and establish $\\langle M_{\\rm ap}^3\\rangle$ as a practical observable for joint analyses in current and future surveys.",

        "abstract": "Monitoring magnetic and activity variations in A- and B-type stars with ultra-weak magnetic fields is essential to understand the origin and evolution of these fields in this region of the HR diagram, with Vega standing as the prototype of this category. We collected high-resolution spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric data with SOPHIE (OHP, 2018) and with NARVAL/NEO-NARVAL (TBL, 2018, 2023, and 2024), yielding a total of 13108 individual spectra. Magnetic field maps were reconstructed using the Zeeman-Doppler Imaging method, while brightness maps were derived with a dedicated code developed for this purpose. The average magnetic field confirms a negative radial-field spot at the pole with stable strength, while the maps reveal the long-term stability of an oblique dipole together with smaller magnetic structures consistently detected across observing epochs. In contrast, brightness maps show strong variations in the location of surface spots on timescales of years, possibly shorter, although the spot contrast remains nearly unchanged between 2012, 2018, 2023, and 2024, with a normalized spectral amplitude of 0.0003. No direct correlation between magnetic and brightness features could be established in the simultaneous SOPHIE and NARVAL dataset of 2018. These results suggest that Vega hosts both a persistent fossil magnetic field and a dynamo-generated component, most likely concentrated in equatorial regions.",

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are very promising environments for IMBH mergers and growth due to high escape velocities. Here we demonstrate how GW231123 can be produced in the AGN channel. Using the McFACTS code, we explore the impact of various choices of the black hole (BH) initial mass function (IMF) on predicted mass and spin magnitudes of BBH mergers from the AGN dynamical formation channel. By integrating the likelihood function for GW231123 with the detectable BBH population predicted from AGN using McFACTS, we demonstrate that GW231123 is consistent with a dynamical BBH merger from the AGN channel.

Spectroscopic observations cover multiple phases, including pre-maximum, early decline, and nebular.

During the optical minimum, a discrete absorption feature was observed in the H{\\alpha} and [O I] line profiles. The physical and chemical properties during the early decline and nebular phases were analyzed using the photoionization code CLOUDY. Dust temperature, mass, and grain size were estimated through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to the WISE data.

        "abstract": "In recent years, multiple Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been observed with \"bumps\" in their rising light curves shortly after explosion. Here, we present SN 2021qvo: a SN Ia that exhibits a clear early bump in photometry obtained by the Young Supernova Experiment. Photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2021qvo show that it has a broader light curve, higher peak luminosity, shallower Si II $\\lambda$5972 pseudo-equivalent width, and lower ejecta velocities than normal SNe Ia, which are all consistent with the characteristics of the 2003fg-like (often called \"super-Chandrasekhar\") SN subtype. Including SN 2021qvo, just four known 2003fg-like SNe Ia have sufficient pre-peak data to reveal a rising light-curve bump, and all four have bump detections. Host-galaxy analysis reveals that SN 2021qvo exploded in a low-mass galaxy ${\\rm log}(M_{\\ast}/M_{\\odot}) = 7.83^{+0.17}_{-0.24}$, also consistent with other members of this class. We investigate the validity of the leading early-bump 2003fg-like SN Ia progenitor model, an interaction between the circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta, by modeling the early bump and subsequent light-curve evolution of SN 2021qvo with the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients. We find that the bump can be modeled with a best-fit CSM mass of $\\log_{10}(M_\\mathrm{CSM}/M_{\\odot}) = -2.33^{+0.26}_{-0.15}$. SN 2021qvo adds to the small but growing number of 2003fg-like SNe Ia with rising light-curve bumps; as the number of these SNe Ia with CSM estimates continues to grow, population-level inferences about the CSM distribution will be able to constrain the progenitor scenario for these SNe Ia.",

        "abstract": "The spin of galaxy clusters encodes key information about their formation, dynamics, and the influence of large-scale structure. However, whether clusters possess statistically significant spin and how to measure it observationally remain open questions. Here, we present the first observational statistical detection of coherent spin in galaxy clusters, by using a sample of 2,170 systems with $M > 10^{14}\\, M_\\odot$ selected from a publicly available group catalog based on the SDSS galaxy. Cluster spin is quantified by identifying the orientation in the projected plane that maximizes the redshift difference ($\\Delta Z_{\\rm max}$) between member galaxies in two regions divided by a trial axis. We find strong statistical evidence for coherent rotation, with the observed $\\Delta Z_{\\rm max}$ distribution significantly exceeding randomized controls (nearly $\\sim150\\sigma$ confidence at $\\sim380~\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1}$), especially in richer clusters ($N_{\\mathrm{gal}} > 10$, up to $\\sim300\\sigma$). Stacked visualizations confirm the spatial segregation of redshifted and blueshifted galaxies across the rotation axis. The radial profile of the rotational velocity indicates that it increases as a function of radius. The cluster rotation speed increases with mass, from $\\sim330~\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{14} M_\\odot$ to $\\sim800~\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{15} M_\\odot$. Additionally, cluster spin tends to align parallel with the central galaxy spin and perpendicular to the nearest cosmic filament, particularly in richer systems.

        "abstract": "In many fields including cosmology, statistical inference often relies on Gaussian likelihoods whose covariance matrices are estimated from a finite number of simulations. This finite-sample estimation introduces noise into the covariance, which propagates to parameter estimates, a phenomenon known as the Dodelson-Schneider (DS) effect, leading to inflated uncertainties. While the Massively Optimized Parameter Estimation and Data compression (MOPED) algorithm offers lossless Fisher information-preserving compression, it does not mitigate the DS effect when the compression matrix itself is derived from noisy covariances. In this paper, we propose a modified compression scheme, powered MOPED ($p$-MOPED), which suppresses noise propagation by balancing information retention and covariance estimate noise reduction through a tunable power-law transformation of the sample correlation matrix. We test $p$-MOPED against standard and diagonal MOPED on toy models and on cosmological data from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 3 weak lensing survey. Our results demonstrate that $p$-MOPED consistently outperforms other approaches, especially in regimes with limited simulations, offering a robust compression strategy for high-dimensional data analyses under practical constraints.",

To investigate the hydrogenation of these methylated PAHs, the simplest, toluene ($\\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_5}$), was exposed to H-atoms. This demonstrated how the presence of a methyl group changes the reactivity towards atomic hydrogen as compared to benzene and other PAHs and how this may alter its chemistry in the ISM. Toluene was deposited onto a graphite surface in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber and then exposed to a H-atom beam. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were used to investigate the reaction between H-atoms and toluene and the masses of hydrogenation products were measured with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). H-atom exposure of toluene leads to superhydrogenation of toluene and the formation of methyl-cyclohexane ($\\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_{11}}$) at long exposure times. The initial cross-section of H-addition is lower than that of other PAHs. Methyl-cyclohexane can be further hydrogenated, leading to the detachment of the methyl group and production of cyclohexane ($\\mathrm{C_6H_{12}}$) and methane ($\\mathrm{CH_4}$). Toluene may be fully hydrogenated through its interaction with H-atoms, although it has a smaller initial cross-section for H-atom addition compared to other PAHs. This likely reflects it having a smaller geometric cross-section and the low flexibility of the benzene ring when undergoing sp$^3$ hybridization. The removal of the methyl group at high H-atom fluences provides a top down formation route to smaller molecules with the possibility of the formation of a radical cyclohexane combining with other species in an interstellar environment to form prebiotic molecules.",

No-scale models of inflation can reproduce the predictions of the Starobinsky model, but also provide a framework for incorporating deformations that could accommodate more easily the ACT and SPT data. We discuss this possibility in the contexts of SU(5) GUTs, taking into account the constraints on these models imposed by the longevity of the proton, the cold dark matter density and the measured value of the Higgs boson. We find that SU(5) with a CMSSM-like pattern of soft supersymmetry breaking has difficulty in accommodating all the constraints, whereas SU(5) with pure gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking can accommodate them easily. We also consider two SO(10) symmetry-breaking patterns that can accommodate the ACT and SPT data. In both the SU(5) and SO(10) models, the deformations avoid issues associated with large initial field values in the Starobinsky model: in particular, the total number of e-folds is largely independent of the initial conditions.",

        "abstract": "$\\gamma$-ray pulsar halos, formed by inverse Compton scattering of electrons and positrons propagating in the pulsar-surrounding interstellar medium with background photons, serve as an ideal probe for Galactic cosmic-ray propagation on small scales (typically tens of parsecs). While the associated electron and positron propagation is often modeled using homogeneous and isotropic diffusion, termed here as normal diffusion, the actual transport process is expected to be more complex. This work introduces the Pulsar Halo Emission Computation Tool (PHECT), a lightweight software designed for modeling pulsar halo emission. PHECT incorporates multiple transport models extending beyond normal diffusion, accounting for different possible origins of pulsar halos. Users can conduct necessary computations simply by configuring a YAML file without manual code edits. Furthermore, the tool adopts finite-volume discretizations that remain stable on non-uniform grids and in the presence of discontinuous coefficients. PHECT is ready for the increasingly precise observational data and the rapidly growing sample of pulsar halos.",

Focusing on a specific quadratic scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling, we identify two distinct classes of compact objects: one with a regular scalar field at the origin -- connected to general relativity in an appropriate limit -- and another {one} with a divergent scalar field at the origin but a regular geometry. We analyze both purely scalar and matter-supported (hybrid) configurations, showing that the former can describe a broad class of compact objects, while the latter can reproduce neutron star-like masses even when modeled with a simple polytropic equation of state. Furthermore, we highlight distinctive phenomenological signatures, including the ability of these stars to exceed known compactness limits and their potential to act as gravitational wave super-emitters. We also examined the motion of test particles non-minimally coupled to the scalar field and showed the existence of stable circular orbits within the Schwarzschild's ISCO and static configurations at finite radii for particles with zero angular momentum.",

In this paper we present the JHK medium resolution (R~3000) spectra of 25 7-75 M_Jup (spectral types L3.0-M6.0) brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster obtained with MOSFIRE installed at the W. M. Keck I telescope. We obtained the spectral types of the targets in our sample using template brown dwarf and planetary-mass objects' spectra. We confirmed their extreme youth (<5 Myr) and membership to the cluster using spectral indices, and the diversity of their spectra even for targets with similar spectral types. Six of our targets presented Pa-beta and Bra-gamma emission lines, suggesting the existence of accreting protoplanetary disks to objects with masses as low as 7 M_Jup. After analyzing the emission lines of those objects, and measuring their accretion rates, we compared them to those of stars, brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects, confirming that planetary-mass young objects deplete their disks quickly at young ages. Finally, we illustrate the spectral evolution of a 7-10 M_Jup planetary-mass object through its life from 1-3 Myr to 200 Myr old using one of our latest spectra type targets, and other targets from the literature with older age, but similar estimated masses.

With fluorescence telescope measurements of $X_{\\mathrm{max}}$ in particular, there are opportunities to improve this situation by leveraging more information from the longitudinal shower development profile beyond just the depth at which its maximum occurs. Although there have been ML studies on extracting composition or mass groups from surface signals, parametrized profiles, or from derived parameters (e.g. $X_{\\mathrm{max}}$ distributions), to our knowledge, we present the first study of a deep-learning neural-network approach to directly predict a primary's mass ($\\ln A$) from the full longitudinal energy-deposit profile of simulated extensive air showers. We train and validate our model on a large suite of simulated showers, generated with CONEX and EPOS-LHC, covering nuclei from $A = 1$ to $61$, sampled uniformly in $\\ln A$. After rescaling, our network achieves a maximum bias better than 0.4 in $\\ln A$ on unseen test showers with a resolution ranging between 1.5 for protons and 1 for iron over a large range of noise conditions, corresponding to a proton-iron merit factor of 2.19, outperforming the predictive power of either $X_{\\mathrm{max}}$ or $N_\\mu$ alone. This performance is only mildly degraded when predictions are made on simulations using the Sibyll-2.3d hadronic interaction model, which was not used in training, showing these features are robust against model choice. Our results suggest that the full shower profile may contain latent composition-sensitive features which have as much discriminating power as $X_{\\mathrm{max}}$.",

        "abstract": "We present a calibrated database of reflectance spectra for the solar system planets (i.e., Mercury, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) and for Titan, spanning from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. We considered data collected over 60 years of planetary observations, employing a broad range of geometries and facilities (spacecraft and ground-based observatories). To correct for differences in observational geometries and data quality, we adopted a two-step calibration process that standardized each spectrum to the planet's geometric albedo values and corrected for planetary heterogeneity and calibration effects. The calibrated datasets were then combined across wavelengths, leading to a reference composite reflectance spectrum for each planet. As a test of this spectral library for exoplanetary research, we simulated direct imaging observations of the Proxima Centauri and HD 219134 systems as solar system analogs, as well as the solar system at a distance of 10 parsecs. We also explored the detection limitations of direct imaging instruments imposed by the inner and outer working angles for Earth and Jupiter-like exoplanets as a function of system distance. Additionally, we used the visible light portion of the results to produce realistic color reconstructions of each planet. Standardizing reflectance spectra in this work improves our baseline for interpreting new reflected light observations of exoplanets through comparative planetology. This spectral library can then serve as a calibrated and validated reference in the modeling and preparation for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with future direct imaging missions and for astronomical studies of the solar system.",

        "abstract": "It has been proposed that measurements of scattering times ($\\tau$) from fast radio bursts (FRB) may be used to infer the FRB host dispersion measure (DM) and its redshift. This approach relies on the existence of a correlation between $\\tau$ and DM within FRB hosts such as that observed for Galactic pulsars. We assess the measurability of a $\\tau - $DM$_{\\rm host}$ relation through simulated observations of FRBs within the ASKAP/CRAFT survey, taking into account instrumental effects. We show that even when the FRB hosts intrinsically follow the $\\tau - $DM relation measured for pulsars, this correlation cannot be inferred from FRB observations; this limitation arises mostly from the large variance around the average cosmic DM value given by the Macquart relation, the variance within the $\\tau - $DM relation itself, and observational biases against large $\\tau$ values. We argue that theoretical relations have little utility as priors on redshift, e.g., for purposes of galaxy identification, and that the recent lack of an observed correlation between scattering and DM in the ASKAP/CRAFT survey is not unexpected, even if our understanding of a $\\tau - $DM$_{\\rm host}$ relation is correct.",

In this study, we performed a polarization analysis of MRC 0600-399 and a nearby radio source using MeerKAT L-band data. To interpret the Faraday structure, we constructed the Pseudo-3D visualization map of the reconstructed Faraday dispersion function 3D cube. MRC 0600-399 has a complicated Faraday depth structure, and some of the Faraday depth features are in good agreement with the 2D structure on the celestial sphere. For the northern jet of MRC 0600-399, the Faraday depth values show a clear gap at the tip region. Based on the polarization analysis and comparison with the other observation, we concluded that the synchrotron radiation from the tip region of the northern jet originates from the magnetic field on the cold front.",

        "abstract": "Broad absorption line (BAL) quasars are often considered X-ray weak relative to their optical/UV luminosity, whether intrinsically (i.e., the coronal emission is fainter) or due to large column densities of absorbing material. The SDSS-V is providing optical spectroscopy for samples of quasar candidates identified by eROSITA as well as Chandra, XMM or Swift, making the resulting datasets ideal for characterising the BAL quasar population within an X-ray selected sample. We use the Balnicity Index (BI) to identify the BAL quasars based on absorption of the CIV $\\lambda\\,1549$ emission line in the optical spectra, finding 143 BAL quasars in our sample of 2317 X-ray selected quasars within $1.5\\le z \\le3.5$. This observed BAL fraction of $\\approx$ 6 per cent is comparable to that found in optically selected samples. We also identify absorption systems via the Absorption Index (AI) which includes mini-BALs and NALs, finding 954 quasars with AI $>0$. We consider the CIV emission space (equivalent width vs. blueshift) to study the BAL outflows within the context of the radiatively driven accretion disc-wind model. X-ray selection excludes the highest outflow velocities in emission but includes the full range of absorption velocities which we suggest is consistent with the BAL gas being located further from the X-ray corona than the emitting gas. We observe both X-ray weak and X-ray strong BALs (via the optical-to-X-ray spectral slope, $\\alpha_\\text{ox}$) and detect little evidence for differing column densities between the BAL and non-BAL quasars, suggesting the BALs and non-BALs have the same shielding gas and intrinsic X-ray emission.",

We analyze cluster mass, age, size, concentration, and fractal structure using the Q parameter and the fractal dimension fdim, and examine their correlations with key physical parameters. Our results reveal systematic environmental trends: clusters in groups are generally younger, less massive, slightly larger, and less centrally concentrated than those in pairs or singles. Fractality is more pronounced in clusters within pairs and groups, with 44% of group clusters exhibiting fractal substructure compared to 38.5% for pairs and 33.2% for singles. Similarly, median fdim values increase from singles (1.13) to pairs (1.16) to groups (1.25), reflecting greater substructure in denser environments. These findings indicate that both intrinsic cluster properties and environmental context significantly influence cluster evolution. More massive clusters tend to evolve toward centrally concentrated, radially symmetric configurations, while less massive clusters retain fractal features for longer periods. Overall, our study demonstrates that open clusters do not evolve in isolation: interactions with the environment play a critical role in shaping their structural evolution and dynamical state.",

        "abstract": "Solar photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms are easier to estimate than full vector magnetograms since the line-of-sight component (Blos) can be obtained from total intensity and circular polarization signals, unlike the perpendicular component (Bperp), which depends on harder-to-measure linear polarization. Unfortunately, the line of sight component by itself is not physically meaningful, as it is just one component of the underlying vector and one whose relationship to gravity changes pixel-to-pixel. To produce an estimate of the radial component (Br) a common ``correction'' is often applied that assumes the field is radial, which is nearly always false. This paper investigates recovering full vector field information from Blos by building on the recent SuperSynthIA approach that was originally used with Stokes vectors as input for simultaneous inversion and disambiguation. As input, the method accepts one or more line-of-sight magnetograms and associated metadata; as output, our method estimates full vector field in heliographic components, meaning that the physically-relevant vector components are returned without need for further disambiguation steps or component transforms. We demonstrate the ability to produce good estimates of the full vector field on unseen examples from both HMI and GONG, including examples that predate the Solar Dynamics Observatory mission. Our results show that learning is not a replacement for a dedicated vector-field observing facilities, but may serve to unlock information from past data and at the very least, provide more accurate Br maps from Blos than are created using the simple viewing angle assumption.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the shadow properties of the Kerr-Newman-Anti-de Sitter black hole coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics. We construct the shadow by employing the celestial coordinate approach for observers located at finite distances, accounting for the non-asymptotically flat nature of the spacetime. The size, distortion, area, and oblateness of the shadow are analyzed in terms of the black hole parameters, including the spin, effective charge, and nonlinearity parameter. We further explore observational constraints using the Event Horizon Telescope results for M87* and Sgr~A*. The angular diameters inferred from the observed images allow us to bound the parameter space of the model, showing that both spin and nonlinearity play key roles in shaping the shadow and in restricting the effective charge. Additionally, we examine the energy emission rate derived from the shadow radius and Hawking temperature, highlighting the influence of rotation and nonlinear electrodynamics on black hole evaporation. Our results demonstrate that the black hole model provides a physically consistent and observationally viable extension of the standard Kerr paradigm, with potential implications for near-horizon quantum processes and tests of gravity beyond general relativity.",

        "abstract": "Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is a powerful technique that can achieve sub-milliarcsecond resolution. However, it requires complex and often manual post-correlation calibration to correct for instrumental, geometric, and propagation-related errors. Unlike connected-element interferometers, VLBI arrays typically provide raw visibilities rather than science-ready data, and existing pipelines are largely semi-automated and reliant on user supervision. We present VIPCALs, a fully automated, end-to-end calibration pipeline for continuum VLBI data that operates without human intervention or prior knowledge of the dataset. Designed for scalability to thousands of sources and heterogeneous archival observations, VIPCALs addresses the needs of initiatives such as the Search for Milli-Lenses (SMILE) project. Implemented in Python using ParselTongue, VIPCALs reproduces the standard AIPS calibration workflow in a fully unsupervised mode. Besides the usual calibration tasks, the pipeline also performs automatic reference antenna selection, calibrator identification, and generates diagnostic outputs for inspection. We validated it on a representative sample of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data corresponding to 1 000 sources from the SMILE project. VIPCALs successfully calibrated observations of 955 of the test sources across multiple frequency bands. Over 91% of the calibrated datasets achieved successful fringe fitting on target in at least half of the solutions attempted. The median ratio of calibrated visibilities to initial total visibilities was 0.87. The average processing time was below 10 minutes per dataset, demonstrating both efficiency and scalability. VIPCALs enables robust, reproducible, and fully automated calibration of VLBI continuum data, significantly lowering the entry barrier for VLBI science and making large-scale projects like SMILE feasible.",

        "title": "Multiwavelength Observations of the Apparently Non-repeating FRB 20250316A",
        "abstract": "The physical origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains uncertain. Although multiwavelength observations offer critical diagnostics and have been widely conducted, only Galactic FRB~20200428D is associated with an X-ray burst from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154. Here, we present multiwavelength follow-up observations of the nearby bright FRB~20250316A, including the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), Einstein Probe (EP) X-ray mission, Chandra X-ray Observatory, Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) and Space Variable Object Monitor/Visible Telescope (SVOM/VT). A 13.08-hour FAST follow-up observational campaign suggests that this burst is likely a one-off event. A prompt EP follow-up and multi-epoch observational campaign totaling $>$ 100 ks led to the detection of an X-ray source within the angular resolution of its Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT, $10^{\\prime\\prime}$). A subsequent Chandra observation revealed this source to be offset by $7^{\\prime\\prime}$ from the FRB position, and established a 0.5-10 keV flux upper limit of $7.6\\times 10^{-15}$ $\\rm erg\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}$ at the FRB position, corresponding to $\\sim 10^{39}$ $\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$ at the 40 Mpc distance of the host galaxy NGC~4141. These results set one of the most stringent limits on X-ray emission from a non-repeating FRB, disfavoring ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) as counterparts of apparently one-off FRBs and offering critical insights into afterglow models. Our study suggests that an arcsecond localization of both the FRB and its potential X-ray counterpart is essential for exploring the X-ray counterpart of an FRB.",

        "abstract": "Young neutron stars born with magnetic fields $B\\gtrsim 10^{16}$ G become hyperactive as the field inside the star evolves through ambipolar diffusion on a timescale $\\sim 10^9$ s. We simulate this process numerically and find that it can eject magnetic loops from the star. The internal magnetic field first diffuses to the crust surrounding the liquid core and then erupts from the surface, taking a significant amount of crustal material with it. The eruption involves magnetic reconnection, generating a giant gamma-ray flare. A significant fraction of the eruption energy is carried by the neutron-rich crustal material, which must go through a phase of decompression and nuclear heating. The massive ejecta should produce additional emission components after the giant flare, including radioactively powered gamma-rays, optical emission, and much later a radio afterglow. The predicted eruptions may rarely happen in observed magnetars in our galaxy, which are relatively old and rarely produce giant flares. The model can, however, explain the extremely powerful flare from SGR 1806-20 in December 2004, its ejecta mass, and afterglow. More active, younger magnetars may produce frequent crustal eruptions and form unusual nebulae. Such hyperactive magnetars are candidates for the central engines of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs). We argue that each eruption launches an ultrarelativistic magnetosonic pulse leading the ejecta and steepening into a relativistic shock capable of emitting an FRB.",

        "abstract": "The vertical (Lense-Thirring) precession of the innermost accretion flows has been discussed as a sensitive indicator of the rotational properties of neutron stars (NSs) and their equation of state because it vanishes for a non-rotating star. In this work, we apply the Hartle-Thorne spacetimes to study the frequencies of the precession for both geodesic and non-geodesic (fluid) flows. We build on previous findings on the effect of the NS quadrupole moment, which revealed the importance of the interplay between the relativistic and classical precession. Because of this interplay, the widely used Lense-Thirring metric, linear in the NS angular momentum, is insufficient to calculate the behaviour of the precession frequency across an astrophysically relevant range of NS angular momentum values. We find that even for a moderately oblate NSs, the dependencies of the precession frequency on the NS angular momentum at radii within the innermost accretion region have maxima that occur at relatively low values of the NS angular momentum. We conclude that very different groups of accreting NSs, slow and fast rotators, can display the same precession frequencies. This may explain the lack of evidence for a correlation between the frequencies of the observed low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations and the NS spin. In our work, we provide a full, general description of precession behaviour, and also examples that assume specific NS and quark star (MIT bag) equation of state. Our calculations are reproducible using the associated Wolfram Mathematica notebook.",

The analysis reveals significant polarisation, with polarisation degrees (PD) of ${\\sim}1.4$\\% in the NB and ${\\sim}3.7$\\% in the HB, indicating a notable decrease in polarisation when transitioning from the HB to the NB. The polarisation angles show a consistent trend across the states. Spectropolarimetric analysis favours a dependence of the polarisation on the energy. The Comptonised component shows similar polarisation in both the HB and NB and is higher than the theoretical expectation for a boundary or spreading layer. This suggests a contribution from the wind or the presence of an extended accretion disc corona (ADC) to enhance the polarisation. The results obtained here highlight the importance of using polarimetric data to better understand the accretion mechanisms and the geometry of this class of sources, providing insights into the nature of the accretion flow and the interplay between different spectral components. Overall, the findings advance our understanding of the physical processes governing accretion in low-mass X-ray binaries.",

Binaries in an NSC evolve via close encounters with surrounding stars and secular processes related to the SMBH. We study moderately soft and hard binaries ($0.03$-$2.5\\,\\mathrm{au}$, $M \\lesssim 2\\,M_\\odot$) initially at galactocentric radii 0.1 and 0.3 pc using three-body simulations including von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations and tidal dissipation over $\\sim 10$ Gyr. Binaries migrate both inward and outward as a consequence of kicks received in the three-body encounters. Inward migration leads to destruction via mergers and evaporation, while outward migration is a pathway to retaining intact binaries for $\\gtrsim 10$ Gyr. All surviving binaries are hard and circular, but outcomes for binaries initially at the hard-soft boundary are stochastic. We find that: (i) about $0.3$ percent of evaporated binaries fall into the SMBH's loss cone, (ii) at least $1$ percent of mergers occur late enough to appear as blue straggler stars (BSSs) on the main sequence or as recently evolved red giants, (iii) about $1$ percent of binaries initially at 0.1 pc merge within the inner arcsec of the NSC, and (iv) less than about $80$ percent of field-star collisions with a binary star lead to a subsequent merger; a three-body pile up, which are relatively common in the first 1-2 Gyr and could serve as a way to form more massive BSSs in the NSC. We predict that a small fraction of binaries originate closer to the SMBH than their present-day orbits, and vice versa for evaporated binaries and BSSs. The mergers confined to the inner arcsec occur after $\\gtrsim 300$ Myr, too long to be directly related to the formation of the S-stars or G-objects, but suggest that the inner arcsec is contaminated with BSSs from earlier star formation events.",

        "abstract": "The last years have seen the first cryogenic detectors to be proposed for usage on balloon-borne missions. In such missions, the instrument will be exposed to the high radiation environment of the upper atmosphere. This radiation can induce a significant background to the measurements, something which can be mitigated through the use of an anti-coincidence shield. For hard X-ray and gamma-ray detectors such a shield typically consists photomultiplier tubes or, more recently, silicon photomultipliers coupled to scintillators placed around the detector. When using cryogenic detectors, the shield can be placed around the entire cryostat which will make it large, heavy and expensive. For the ASCENT (A SuperConducting ENergetic x-ray Telescope) mission, which uses Transition Edge Detectors, it was therefore considered to instead place the shield inside. This comes with the challenge of operating it at cryogenic temperatures. For this purpose, we tested the performance of 2 different types of GAGG:Ce scintillators down to 15 mK for the first time. Although significant variations of both the decay time and the light yield were found when varying the temperature, at 4 K its performance was found to be similar to that at room temperature. Furthermore, unexpected behavior around 2 K was found for both types of GAGG:Ce, leading to more in depth studies around these temperatures. Overall, the studies show that the combination of materials will allow to produce a functional anti-coincidence shield at several Kelvin.",

Consequently, many machine learning models have been trained to classify exoplanet transit signals - typically done by using time series light curves. In this work, we attempt a different approach and try to improve the efficiency of these algorithms by fitting only derived planetary parameters, instead of full time-series light curves. We investigate and evaluate 4 models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks) on the KEPLER dataset, using precision-recall trade-off and accuracy metrics. We show that this approach can identify up to about 90% of false positives, implying the planetary parameters encompass most of the relevant information contained in a light curve. Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Networks produce the highest accuracy and the best precision-recall trade-off. We also note that the accuracies as a function of the stellar eclipse flag SS have the best performance.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the evolution of dark energy using a model-independent framework based on the cosmographic approach. The main objective of this work is to construct a dynamical dark energy model directly from the kinematic equations of the cosmographic parameters, rather than adopting any arbitrary parametrization of the cosmological parameters. We employ the differential equation for the jerk parameter and map it to an anharmonic oscillator equation. From this, we derive an analytical expression for the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy. Interestingly, this form of the EoS depends on only a single parameter. Using the recently released DESI DR2 BAO data, Pantheon+ supernova dataset, and a compressed Planck likelihood, we constrain the cosmological parameters within this framework. Our results indicate a deviation from the cosmological constant behavior at late times, suggesting a dynamical nature of dark energy. Our findings contradict the DESI DR2 analysis based on the CPL parametrization, as no phantom-barrier crossing is observed in our analysis. This study highlights that model-independent reconstructions rooted in kinematical quantities can provide robust insights into the true nature of dark energy.",

Our models combine radiative transfer and disk vertical structure equations with input motivated by first-principles three-dimensional simulations. We found that HFQPO power spectra may be sensitive to spatial distribution of dissipation rates while the quality factors are more sensitive to black hole spin. We discuss the observational implications of our results in context of steep power law (SPL) spectra from BHXBs that are seen together with HFQPOs, and how QPO properties may be indicators of the underlying physical oscillations.",

        "abstract": "Solar prominences are the most prominent large-scale structures observed above the solar limb in emission in chromospheric lines but in absorption in coronal lines. At the bottom of prominences often appears a bubble, with plumes occasionally rising from the prominence-bubble interface. The plumes may potentially play an important role in the mass supply and thermodynamic evolution of prominences, but their nature and generation mechanism are elusive. Here we use the high-resolution H-alpha observations obtained by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) to investigate a quiescent prominence with bubbles and plumes on 8 November 2022. Within an interval of about two hours, enhanced spicular activity disturb the prominence-bubble interface, producing bursts of small-scale plumes rising through the prominence. Characterized by clustered spicules jetting at higher speeds (sometimes exceeding the typical chromopsheric Alfven speed) and longer life-time (over 15 minutes), the enhanced spicular activity differs markedly from regular spicules. We hence conjecture that the enhanced spicular activity may drive shock waves, which trigger the magnetic Richtmyer-Meshkov instability at the prominence-bubble interface, leading to the formation of small-scale plumes. These observations provide evidence that the enhanced spicular activity plays a potentially important role in the dynamic evolution of bubbles and plumes, thereby participating in the mass supply of solar prominences.",

        "abstract": "The Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) is one of four science instruments on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which began routine operations in July 2022. As JWST's primary spectroscopic instrument for faint, distant targets, NIRSpec plays a central role in several of the mission's core science goals. Its signature multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode enables the simultaneous acquisition of spectra for up to a hundred targets across the field of view, using a micro-shutter array (MSA) comprised of nearly 250,000 individually addressable micro-electromechanical shutters.   The MSA is susceptible to occasional electrical shorts, which produce unwanted infrared glow in MOS exposures, rendering them unusable and wasting valuable observatory time. Mitigation requires promptly identifying the affected shutter(s) and masking the corresponding row(s) or column(s) to prevent future activation. However, masking shutters unnecessarily reduces NIRSpec's multiplexing capacity, so it is important to minimize the extent of masking while reliably suppressing the short's effects.   More than two years of operations have informed refinements in technical procedures and operational decision-making around short mitigation. This experience also supports new efforts to identify and unmask previously affected rows or columns where shorts have since disappeared, enabling the recovery of multiplexing capacity that would otherwise remain lost.   As MSA technology matures toward use in future missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory, operational strategies developed for NIRSpec remain relevant beyond JWST. This paper provides an overview of MSA shorts mitigation operations, summarizes shorts observed since the completion of commissioning, and describes the evolving contingency procedures that have enabled continued science productivity from this unique payload.",

In the beam of Resolve there is a filter wheel containing \\xray{} filters.

The filter wheel consists of six filter positions. Two open positions, one $^{55}$Fe source to aid in spectrometer characterization during the commissioning phase, and three transmission filters: a neutral density filter, an optical blocking filter, and a beryllium filter.   The X-ray intensity, pulse period, and pulse separation of a MXS are highly configurable. Furthermore, the switch--on time is synchronized with the spacecraft's internal clock to give accurate start and end times of the pulses.   One of the issues raised during ground testing was the susceptibility of a MXS at high voltage to ambient light. Although measures were taken to mitigate the light leak, the efficacy of those measures must be verified in orbit. Along with an overview of issues raised during ground testing, this article will discuss the calibration source and the filter performance in--flight and compare with the transmission curves present in the Resolve calibration database.",

        "abstract": "Radio waves undergo scattering by small-scale density fluctuations during propagation through the solar-terrestrial environment, substantially affecting the observed characteristics of solar radio bursts. This scattering process can be effectively modeled as photon diffusion in phase space. In this study, we present a comprehensive comparison between the quasilinear diffusion coefficients and those calculated by ray-tracing the photon trajectories in numerically generated, broadband, isotropic density fluctuation fields in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) configurations. The comparative analysis demonstrates that for weak scattering, the simulated diffusion coefficients agree well with the quasilinear theoretical predictions. However, when the radio frequency approaches the electron plasma frequency and/or the density fluctuation amplitude becomes significant, photons experience strong scattering. Under such conditions, the quasilinear theory tends to underestimate the scattering strength of photons induced by 2D density fluctuations while overestimating the scattering strength in 3D cases. Furthermore, we implement a group velocity correction to the theoretical diffusion coefficients, based on the effective propagation speed averaged over all test photons. The corrected coefficients provide an accurate quantification of the scattering strength for radio waves propagating through 3D density fluctuations. The physical mechanisms underlying these phenomena are elucidated in the discussion.",

The combination of a low cross section and zero electromagnetic charge ensure that a neutrino retains most information about its original source while traversing the universe. On the other hand, these low cross sections, combined with a reduced flux at higher energies, make the neutrino one of the most elusive particles to detect in the standard model. The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) aims to detect sporadic neutrino interactions in the Greenlandic ice sheet by means of electromagnetic signals in the radio frequency range, induced by the produced charged secondary particles. The low incoming neutrino flux forces the detector to set a low trigger threshold, leading to the measured data being overwhelmed by thermal noise fluctuations. Hence, a sophisticated and robust filter is needed to differentiate between neutrino-like signals and noise. In this contribution we present the current work on the development of such a filter, based on a convolutional neural network architecture. The network employed uses real RNO-G data and simulated neutrino signals to categorize measured data as noise or neutrino-like events.",

This phase is all but negligible, yet it is still poorly understood what role it plays across the solar cycle and what governs it.   Aims. We present a statistical analysis of ELP flares over four years between May 2010 and May 2014 based on properties like eruptivity, magnetic configuration, and late-phase duration, delay and strength in order to understand what influences the likelihood of this class of flares and their behavior on a general scale.   Methods. We primarily make use of data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's (SDO) Extreme-ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE), as well as complimentary spatial information provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), to assess relationships between the various parameters and see if ELP flares differ from the general flare population. We quantify the criteria for ELP flare definition and determine its characteristics.   Results. Our analysis shows that about 10% of all flares with a GOES class greater than or equal to C3.0 experience an EUV late phase (179 out of 1803). This percentage decreases from solar minimum to solar maximum. C-class flares are considerably less likely to be identified as ELP flares than their higher-energetic counterparts, which is in line with previous investigations. The majority of this type of flares is confined (67%), more so than in the general flare population (greater than or equal to C5.0). There appears to be a (linear) relationship between the late-phase delay and its duration. The ratio of the emission peak of the late and main flare phase lies between 0.3 and 5.9, and exceeds 1 in 71.5% of cases, which is considerably higher than previously reported.",

        "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), as crucial drivers of space weather, necessitate a comprehensive understanding of their initiation and evolution in the solar corona, in order to better predict their propagation. Solar Cycle 24 exhibited lower sunspot numbers compared to Solar Cycle 23, along with a decrease in the heliospheric magnetic pressure. Consequently, a higher frequency of weak CMEs was observed during Solar Cycle 24. Forecasting CMEs is vital, and various methods, primarily involving the study of the global magnetic parameters using datasets like Space-weather Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager Active Region Patches (SHARP), have been employed in earlier works. In this study, we perform numerical simulations of CMEs within a magnetohydrodynamics framework using Message Passing Interface - Adaptive Mesh Refinement Versatile Advection Code (MPI-AMRVAC) in 2.5 dimensions. By employing the breakout model for CME initiation, we introduce a multipolar magnetic field configuration within a background bipolar magnetic field, inducing shear to trigger the CME eruption. Our investigation focuses on understanding the impact of the background global magnetic field on CME eruptions. Furthermore, we analyze the evolution of various global magnetic parameters in distinct scenarios (failed eruption, single eruption, multiple eruptions) resulting from varying amounts of helicity injection in the form of shear at the base of the magnetic arcade system. Our findings reveal that an increase in the strength of the background poloidal magnetic field constrains CME eruptions. Furthermore, we establish that the growth rate of absolute net current helicity is the crucial factor that determines the likelihood of CME eruptions.",

        "abstract": "The CCOR Compact Coronagraph is a series of two operational solar coronagraphs sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They were designed, built, and tested by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). The CCORs will be used by NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center to detect and track Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and predict the Space Weather. CCOR-1 is on board the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite -U (GOES-U, now GOES-19/GOES-East). GOES-U was launched from Kennedy Space Flight Center, Florida, on 25 June 2024. CCOR-2 is on board the Space Weather Follow On at Lagrange point 1 (SWFO-L1). SWFO-L1 is scheduled to launch in the fall of 2025. SWFO will be renamed SOLAR-1 once it reaches L1. The CCORs are white-light coronagraphs that have a field of view and performance similar to the SOHO LASCO C3 coronagraph. CCOR-1 FOV spans from 4 to 22 Rsun, while CCOR-2 spans from 3.5 to 26 Rsun. The spatial resolution is 39 arcsec for CCOR-1 and 65 arcsec for CCOR-2. They both operate in a band-pass of 470 - 740 nm. The synoptic cadence is 15 min and the latency from image capture to the forecaster on the ground is less than 30 min. Compared to past generation coronagraphs such as the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO), CCOR uses a compact design; all the solar occultation is done with a single multi-disk external occulter. No internal occulter is used. This allowed a substantial reduction in size and mass compared to SECCHI COR-2, for example, but with slightly lower signal-to-noise ratio. In this article, we review the science that the CCORs will capitalize on for the purpose of operational space weather prediction. We give a description of the driving requirements and accommodations, and provide details on the instrument design. In the end, information on ground processing and data levels is provided.",

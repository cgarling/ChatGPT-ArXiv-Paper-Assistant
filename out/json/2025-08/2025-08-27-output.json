        "COMMENT": "This paper directly addresses near-field cosmology by studying dark matter observations in Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies, including both classical and ultra-faint satellites. It discusses DM density profiles (core/cusp), satellite selection, and implications for indirect DM searches, matching the 'Near-Field Cosmology' criterion very closely.",

They have been long accounted among the best targets to search for indirect DM signatures in the GeV-to-TeV gamma-rays due to absence of astrophysical gamma-ray foreground or background emission. We present forecasts on the sensitivity of the future CTAO for the search for annihilating or decaying DM in such targets. We perform an original selection of candidates out of the current catalog of known objects, including both classical and ultra-faint targets. For each of them, we calculate the expected amount of DM using the most updated and complete available samples of photometric and spectroscopic data of member stars, adopting a common framework of data treatment for both classes of objects. In this way, we are able to generate novel astrophysical factor profiles for general indirect DM searches that we compare with the current literature. Out of a starting sample of 64 dSphs, we highlight the 8 most promising targets - DraI, CBe, UMaII, UMi and Wil1 in the Northern hemisphere; RetII, Scl and SgrII in the Southern hemisphere - for which different DM density models (either cored or cuspy) lead to similar expectations, at variance with what happens for other DM targets - thus resulting in more robust predictions. We find that CTAO will provide the strongest limits above ~10 TeV, down to values of velocity-averaged annihilation cross section of ~5$ \\times 10^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and up to decay lifetimes of ~10$^{26}$ s for combined limits on the best targets. We argue that the largest source of inaccuracy is due to the still imprecise determination of the DM content, especially for ultra-faint dSphs. We propose possible strategies of observation for CTAO, either optimized on a deep focus on the best known candidates, or on the diversification of targets.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge of the spatially resolved star formation history (SFH) of disk galaxies provides crucial insight into disk assembly, quenching, and chemical evolution. However, most reconstructions, both for the Milky Way and for external galaxies, implicitly assume that stars formed at their present-day radii. Using a range of zoom-in cosmological simulations, we show that stellar radial migration introduces strong and systematic biases in such SFH estimates. In the inner disk (R < h_d), early star formation is typically underestimated by 25-50% and late star formation overestimated, giving the misleading impression of prolonged, moderate activity. An exception occurs in the very central bin considered (~ 0.4h_d), which is consistently overestimated due to a net inflow of inward migrators. At intermediate radii and in the outer disk, migration drives the opposite trend: intermediate-age populations are overestimated by 100-200% as stars born in the inner disk migrate outward, whereas genuinely in-situ populations are underestimated by ~ 50% as they themselves continue to migrate. The net effect is that SFH peaks are suppressed and broadened, and the true rate of inside-out disk growth is systematically underestimated. These distortions affect all galaxies in our sample and have direct implications for interpreting spatially resolved SFHs from IFU surveys such as CALIFA and MaNGA, where present-day radii are often used as proxies for stellar birth sites. Correcting these biases will require accounting for disk mass, bar presence, disk kinematics and morphology, while recent birth-radius estimation techniques for Milky Way stars offer a promising path forward.",

These include axion stars, Q-balls, axion miniclusters, dark fermion stars and primordial black holes surrounded by dark matter halos, which arise in a wide range of theories beyond the Standard Model. As such massive objects traverse the interstellar medium, their gravitational influence generates wakes and, if sufficiently compact, drives accretion flows that heat gas in their vicinity. Our general framework extends standard dynamical friction treatments by incorporating finite-size effects, internal density profiles, gas penetration through objects, and criteria for accretion disk formation. We perform detailed numerical calculations of wake formation and gas heating and apply our results to the Leo T dwarf galaxy, establishing new constraints on the dark matter fraction in EDCOs heavier than a solar mass spanning several orders of magnitude in both mass and abundance.",

        "abstract": "X-ray binaries play a significant role in the thermal and ionization history of galaxies. Their X-ray luminosity can shed light on galactic star formation rates and histories. Compact objects are also crucial in the evolution of gravitational wave progenitors. Here we present the results from our work to extend the binary population and spectral synthesis (BPASS) code suite to incorporate X-ray emission onto compact remnants in binary systems. We self-consistently model the accretion disc for each interacting binary system in a grid of stellar evolution models and then combine these to obtain the total X-ray spectra for stellar populations over a range of ages and metallicities. Crucially, these are estimated using the same stellar models as those used for modelling the stellar spectral energy distribution. We utilise first principle equations to calculate the X-ray binary (XRB) evolution, luminosity and spectral energy densities of individual accreting compact objects. Population synthesis using observationally motivated values for R_inner (the accretion disc inner truncation radius) reproduces the observed X-ray number evolution in the Small Magellanic Cloud and the inferred X-ray flux evolution for M51, validating our models. Using these models, we explore the implications of a self-consistent stellar and XRB emission population synthesis for ionizing photon production, the XRB dependence on metallicity and, for XRBs as a potential source of nebular He II emission seen in the spectra of high redshift galaxies. We conclude that XRBs contribute towards powering nebular He II emission without causing significant overestimates of hydrogen ionization.",

        "abstract": "Dust plays a pivotal role in shaping the observed morphology of galaxies. While traditional cosmological simulations often assume a fixed dust-to-gas (DTG) or dust-to-metal (DTM) mass ratio to model dust effects, recent advancements have enabled on-the-fly (OTF) dust modeling that captures the spatial and temporal evolution of dust. In this work, we investigate the impact of dust modeling on galaxy morphology using the NewCluster simulation, which implements a detailed OTF dust model. We generate mock images of NewCluster galaxies under both OTF and fixed DTM models using the radiative transfer code SKIRT, and compare their morphology to JWST observations. We measure morphology indices and use the $G-M_{20}$ test to classify galaxies. We find that the OTF galaxy models exhibit brighter centers and more pronounced bulges than those of the fixed DTM models, resulting in a lower late-type galaxy (LTG) fraction, particularly at high redshifts. This central brightening is linked to a phenomenon we refer to as the DTM cavity, a localized depression in the DTM ratio driven by intense bulge starbursts. Our results highlight the importance of modeling dust evolution in a physically motivated manner, as fixed DTM models fail to capture key morphological features.",

We present new Keck/DEIMOS measurements of the [OII]$\\lambda\\lambda3726,3729$ emission line doublet for star-forming galaxies at $z\\sim1.5$ with existing measurements of redder rest-optical lines from the MOSDEF survey. These new observations enable uniform estimation of the gas-phase oxygen abundance using ratios of the [OII], H$\\beta$, and [OIII] lines for mass-binned samples of star-forming galaxies in 6 redshift bins, employing strong-line calibrations that account for the distinct interstellar medium ionization conditions at $z1$.

In addition, the signal is also sensitive to how the HI is distributed among the dark matter haloes, this being quantified through the HIHM relation, which relates the HI mass to the halo mass. In this work, we investigate whether measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) and bispectrum (BS) at large scales can be used to estimate the HIHM relation, which quantifies the HI distribution at small scales. As a proof of concept, we consider the simulated 21-cm IM signal at $z=1$. We find that the measured 21-cm PS and BS at large scales $(k \\le k_{ul} = 0.32 \\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ are well modeled using perturbation theory, with only two free parameters namely $[\\Omega_{\\rm HI} b_1]$ and $\\gamma = b_2/b_1$. Combining the measured 21-cm PS and BS with an independent measurement of $\\Omega_{\\rm HI} $, we show that it is possible to estimate the three parameters that quantify the HIHM relation. We expect observational estimates of the HIHM relation to shed light on galaxy formation and the evolution of the ISM.

The presence of dust grains and their local distribution play a significant role throughout the protostellar sequence, from the thermodynamics and the chemistry of molecular clouds to the opacity of collapsing protostellar cores and the coupling between the gas and the magnetic field and down to planet formation in young and evolved disks. We aim to simulate the dynamics of the dust, considering the whole range of grain sizes, from few nanometers to millimeters. We implemented a neutral pressureless multifluid that samples the dust size distribution in the RAMSES code. This multifluid is dynamically coupled to the gas via a drag source term and self-gravity, relying on the Eulerian approach. We designed a Riemann solver for the gas and dust mixture that prevents unphysical dust-to-gas ratio variations for well-coupled grains. We illustrated the capacities of the code by performing simulations of a protostellar collapse down to the formation of a first hydrostatic core, both for small and large dust grains. Grains over 100 microns significantly decouple from the gas. The spatial maps and the probability density functions indicate that dust enrichment within the first hydrostatic core and in some locations of the envelope increases as a function of the grain size and the level of initial turbulence. Thanks to the novel Riemann solver, we recovered the terminal velocity regime, even at low resolution. Moreover, we successfully extended it to regimes where the grain inertia matters. The multifluid module performs the coupling between the dust and the gas self-consistently all through the dynamical scales. The dust enrichment in the first hydrostatic core and the envelope have been revised here, assuming the initial turbulence and grain sizes. This enables us to probe new potential conditions for planet formation.",

To examine their internal structure across a wide redshift range and investigate potential redshift dependence, we performed spatially resolved SED fitting using pixedfit software on massive $(\\log(M_*/M_\\odot)\\sim11)$ quiescent galaxies at $0 4$ kpc), while the central regions ($r \\sim 1$ kpc) remain largely unchanged, with stellar mass surface density similar to local quiescent galaxies. The estimated star formation rates are too low to explain the stellar mass growth, indicating an additional stellar mass accumulation process, such as mergers, is necessary. We parameterize the size-mass relation of the most massive galaxies in our sample as $\\log(R_{e,mass}) \\propto \\alpha \\log(M_*)$, and find $\\alpha = 2.67^{+1.14}_{-1.17}$ for $z\\lessapprox2$, consistent with growth dominated by minor mergers, and $\\alpha = 0.91^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ for $z\\gtrapprox2$, consistent with growth dominated by major mergers. These results indicate that massive quiescent galaxies originate from compact quenched systems and grow through combinations of minor and major mergers.",

        "abstract": "The escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation from early galaxies transformed the intergalactic medium (IGM) and is intimately connected to the fueling and feedback processes that regulate galaxy evolution. IGM attenuation interferes with high-redshift LyC observations, but growing samples of LyC observations at z<0.1 are revealing the properties of LyC-emitting galaxies. Along with multi-wavelength observations of nearby LyC-emitting candidates, cosmological simulations, and simulations of LyC escape from star-forming clouds, recent studies are providing insights into the physics of LyC escape and the possible characteristics of the galaxies that reionized the universe. Here, I review progress in LyC detections, the inferred indirect signatures of LyC escape and their application to high redshift, and our current understanding of the physical conditions that lead to high LyC escape. These findings include: LyC-emitting populations are diverse, and multiple factors correlate with LyC escape, particularly neutral gas absorption, dust attenuation, nebular ionization, and concentrated star formation. Radiative feedback plays a critical role in the youngest starbursts with the highest LyC escape fractions, but mechanical feedback may also contribute. Further research is needed to clarify the timing and role of different feedback mechanisms and to connect local LyC-production sites with the broader interstellar medium. Indirect LyC diagnostics show promise, but we need to understand whether and how the properties of LyC-emitting galaxies evolve from low to high redshift.",

        "abstract": "The faint radio-source population includes sources dominated both by star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN), encoding the evolution of activity in the Universe. To investigate its nature, we probabilistically classified 4,471 radio sources at z < 0.947 using low-frequency radio data from the LoTSS Deep Fields alongside a multi-component model for nebular emission, sampled by spectra obtained with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). This was done by combining three tools: (i) the identification of a radio excess, (ii) the BPT diagram, and (iii) a modified Mass Excitation diagram, alongside Monte Carlo methods to estimate the probability that each source is either a star-forming galaxy (SFG), a radio-quiet AGN (RQ AGN), or a high-\\low-excitation radio galaxy (HERG or LERG). This approach extends the probabilistic classification framework of previous works by nearly doubling the redshift range, such that we can now probabilistically classify sources over the latter half of cosmic history. Often regarded as the 'gold standard' method, spectroscopic classifications allow us to evaluate the performance of other methods. Using a 90 per cent reliability threshold, we find reasonable overall agreement (~77 per cent) with state-of-the-art photometric classifications, but significant differences remain, including that we identify 2-5 times more RQ AGN. Furthermore, our high-confidence spectroscopic classifications show that radiatively-efficient and inefficient AGN exhibit clearly distinct Eddington-scaled accretion rate distributions, contrary to recent findings in the literature. Overall, our results highlight the need for new and forthcoming spectroscopic campaigns targeting radio sources, on the pathway to the SKA.",

Marking the final evolution stage before core collapse, the standard picture of WR stars has been that they evolve through three well-defined spectral subtypes known as WN, WC, and WO. Here, we present a detailed analysis of five objects that defy this scheme, demonstrating that WR stars can also evolve directly from the WN to the WO stage. Our study reveals that this direct transition is connected to low metallicity and weaker winds. The WN/WO stars and their immediate WN precursors are hot and emit a high flux of photons capable of fully ionizing helium. The existence of these stages unveil that high mass stars which manage to shed off their outer hydrogen layers in a low-metallicity environment can spend a considerable fraction of their lifetime in a stage that is difficult to detect in integrated stellar populations, but at the same time yields hard ionizing flux. The identification of the WN to WO evolution path for massive stars has significant implications for understanding the chemical enrichment and ionizing feedback in star-forming galaxies, in particular at earlier cosmic times.",

A significant fraction of such mergers could occur in Active Galactic Nuclei disks (AGN), however connecting individual black hole mergers to host galaxies is a challenging endeavor due to large localization uncertainties. We assess the feasibility of determining the fraction of hierarchically merging black hole binaries by computing the angular cross-correlation between gravitational wave localization posteriors and galaxy catalog skymaps. We forecast when the clustering of gravitational wave sky localizations can be measured accurately enough to distinguish the AGN origin scenario from hierarchical mergers in galaxies that do not host AGN.

        "abstract": "We analyze binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the latest Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) using a flexible, non-parametric framework to infer the underlying black hole mass distribution. Our model employs Gaussian Processes (GPs) with astrophysically motivated priors to represent the mass distribution, assuming both component masses are independently drawn from a common mass function. This approach enables us to capture complex features in the population without relying on rigid parametric forms. Motivated by predictions from binary stellar evolution, we focus on the presence of a mass gap in the range $40-120~ M_\\odot$, attributed to the pair-instability supernova (PISN) and pulsational PISN (PPISN) processes. Using our GP-based model, we find for the first time, strong evidence for the onset of this mass gap, locating its lower edge at approximately $45-60 ~M_\\odot$. We observe a suppression in the BBH merger rate when comparing the latest constraints against our GP model, by a factor of $10-60$ at $\\sim60~M_\\odot$, corresponding to the minimum of the mass gap. Additionally, we find evidence of a subpopulation of mergers populating the mass gap around $70 ~M_\\odot$, which we argue is due to hierarchical mergers, as well as of a feature in the $40-50~ M_\\odot$ range, albeit with low significance, which we attribute to the predicted PPISN build up. We discuss the astrophysical implications of this result in light of GW231123, a recently reported BBH merger with a total mass potentially above the PISN gap, suggesting the need for revised models of massive stellar evolution or alternative formation channels.",

        "abstract": "Are the most massive objects in the Universe today the direct descendants of the most massive objects at higher redshift? We address this question by tracing the evolutionary histories of haloes in the MultiDark Planck2 simulation. By following the 100 most massive halos at $z = 0$ across cosmic time, we find that only 40\\% of them were among the largest 100 halos at $z = 1$. This suggests that many of today's most massive clusters were not the most dominant structures at earlier times, while some of the most massive objects at high redshift do not remain in the top mass ranks at later epochs. The hierarchical nature of structure formation predicts that, on average, massive haloes grow over time, with their abundance in comoving space decreasing rapidly at higher redshifts. However, individual clusters exhibit diverse evolutionary paths: some undergo early rapid growth, while others experience steady accretion or significant merger-driven mass changes. A key assumption in self-similar models of cluster evolution is that the most massive objects maintain their rank in the mass hierarchy across cosmic time. In this work, we test this assumption by constructing a mass-complete sample of haloes within the $(1 h^{-1}{\\rm Gpc})^3$ volume of MultiDark and analysing when clusters enter and exit a high-mass-selected sample. Our results demonstrate that cluster selections must be carefully constructed, as significant numbers of objects can enter and leave the sample over time.

The relative amounts of different isotopes (variants of the same element with different masses) in stellar atmospheres provide clues about how our galaxy evolved chemically over billions of years. M dwarfs are small, cool, long-lived stars that comprise three-quarters of all stars in our galaxy. Their spectra exhibit rich fingerprints of their composition, making them potential tracers of chemical evolution. We measure rare carbon and oxygen isotopes in 32 nearby M dwarfs spanning a range of metallicities using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. We find that stars with higher metal content have lower 12C/13C ratios, indicating they formed from material progressively enriched in 13C over time. This pattern is consistent with models where novae eruptions contributed significant amounts of 13C to the interstellar medium over the past few billion years. Our measurements of 16O/18O ratio match theoretical predictions and suggest that metal-rich stars reach 16O/18O ratios significantly lower than the Sun.

Measurements from small samples of tens to hundreds of quasars have been used to constrain the global intensity of the UV background radiation, but so far the power of large-scale surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey has not been used to investigate the UV background in more detail. We develop a CDM-based halo model of the quasar proximity effect, which accounts by construction for the fact that quasars reside in overdense regions. We test this model on quasar Lyman-alpha spectra from the ASTRID cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, which includes self-consistent formation of quasar black holes and the intergalactic medium surrounding them. Fitting the model to individual quasar spectra, we constrain two parameters, r_eq (the radius at which the local quasar radiation intensity equals the background), and the quasar bias b_q (related to host halo mass). We find that r_eq can be recovered in an unbiased fashion with a statistical uncertainty of 25-50% from a single quasar spectrum. Applying such fitting to samples of millions of spectra from e.g., DESI would allow measurement of the UVBG intensity and its evolution with redshift with high precision. We use another, larger-scale, lower resolution simulation (Uchuu) to test how such a large sample of proximity effect measurements could be used to probe the spatial fluctuations in the intergalactic radiation field. We find that the large-scale structure of the UV radiation intensity could be mapped and its power spectrum measured on 100-1000 Mpc/h scales. This could allow the large-scale radiation field to join the density field as a dataset for constraining cosmology and the sources of radiation.",

Using perturbation theory, we compute the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum with the full scale- and time-dependent second-order kernels, incorporating corrections from the scale-dependent growth rate and nonlinear screening. Expanding the bispectrum in spherical harmonics, we analyze the sensitivity of the multipoles to modified gravity and forecast their detectability in a \\textit{Euclid}-like survey.

        "abstract": "Few spectra of directly-imaged exoplanets have been obtained in the mid-infrared (> 3 $\\mu$m). This region is particularly rich in molecular spectral signatures, whose measurements can help recover atmospheric parameters and provide a better understanding of giant planet formation and atmospheric dynamics. In the past years, exoplanet interferometry with the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument has provided medium-resolution spectra of a dozen substellar companions in the near infrared. The 100-meter interferometric baselines allow for the stellar and planetary signals to be efficiently disentangled at close angular separations (< 0.3''). We aim to extend this technique to the mid-infrared using MATISSE, the VLTI's mid-infrared spectro-interferometer. We take advantage of the fringe tracking and off-axis pointing capabilities recently brought by the GRA4MAT upgrade. Using this new mode, we observed the giant planet $\\beta$ Pictoris b in L and M bands (2.75-5 $\\mu$m) at a spectral resolution of 500. We developed a method to correct chromatic dispersion and non-common paths effects in the fringe phase and modelled the planet astrometry and stellar contamination. We obtained a high-signal-to-noise spectrum of $\\beta$ Pictoris b, showing the planet continuum in L (for the first time) and M bands, which contains broad absorption features of H$_2$O and CO. In conjunction with a new GRAVITY spectrum, we modelled it with the ForMoSA nested sampling tool and the Exo-REM grid of atmospheric models, and found a solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio in the planet atmosphere. This study opens the way to the characterization of fainter and closer-in planets with MATISSE, which could complement the JWST at angular separations too close for it to obtain exoplanet spectra. Starting in 2025, the new adaptive optics system brought by the GRAVITY+ upgrade will further extend the detection limits of MATISSE.",

        "abstract": "Context: Cosmic rays drive several key processes for the chemistry and dynamical evolution of star-forming regions. Their effect is quantified mainly by means of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate $\\zeta_2$.   Aims: We aim to obtain a sample of $\\zeta_2$ measurements in 20 low-mass starless cores embedded in different parental clouds, to assess the average level of ionisation in this kind of sources and to investigate the role of the environment in this context. The warmest clouds in our sample are Ophiuchus and Corona Australis, where star formation activity is higher than in the Taurus cloud and the other isolated cores we targeted.   Methods: We compute $\\zeta_2$ using an analytical method based on the {column density} of ortho-$\\rm H_2D^+$, the CO abundance, and the deuteration level of HCO$^+$. To estimate these quantities, we analysed new, high-sensitivity molecular line observations obtained with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) single-dish telescope and archival continuum data from Herschel.   Results: We report $\\zeta_2$ estimates in 17 cores in our sample and provide upper limits on the three remaining sources. The values span almost two orders of magnitude, from $1.3 \\times 10^{-18}\\, \\rm s^{-1}$ to $8.5 \\times 10^{-17}\\, \\rm s^{-1}$.   Conclusions: We find no significant correlation between $\\zeta_2$ and the core's column densities $N\\rm (H_2)$. On the contrary, we find a positive correlation between $\\zeta_2$ and the cores' temperature, estimated via Herschel data: cores embedded in warmer environments present higher ionisation levels. The warmest clouds in our sample are Ophiuchus and Corona Australis, where star formation activity is higher than in the other clouds we targeted. The higher ionisation rates in these regions support the scenario that low-mass protostars in the vicinity of our targeted cores contribute to the re-acceleration of local cosmic rays.",

        "abstract": "(Abridged) Quasar studies with Herschel/SPIRE often report host luminosities ranging from 10^{12} to 10^{14} Lsun, suggestive of star formation rates (SFRs) of up to several thousand Msun/yr. Due to the limited spatial resolution of SPIRE, it is uncertain whether the far-infrared (FIR) emission originates from the quasar itself, nearby sources, or unrelated sources within the SPIRE beam. High-resolution observations at wavelengths close to the SPIRE coverage are needed to pinpoint the true source of the FIR emission. In this work we unambiguously identify the ALMA Band 7 counterparts of a statistical sample of 152 FIR-bright SDSS quasars and estimate the multiplicity rates among these systems. Based on the multiplicities, we assess the importance of mergers as triggers for concomitant accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and extreme star formation. In ~60% of cases, the submm emission originates from a single counterpart within the SPIRE beam, centred on the optical coordinates of the quasar. The multiplicity rate increases by a factor of ~2.5 between redshifts 1 and 2.5. The incidence of multiplicities is consistent among broad absorption line (BAL) quasars and non-BAL quasars. The multiplicities observed in a fraction of the sample indicate that, while mergers enhance gas inflow efficiency, there must be viable alternatives for driving synchronous SMBH growth and intense star formation in isolated systems. We report the serendipitous detection of two CO(6-5) and three CO(7-6) transitions out of the eight such transitions expected based on the spectral setup and the redshifts of the objects in the sample. Higher transitions are not detected, indicating that the quasars are not exciting sufficiently the gas in their hosts. Finally, we also detect a potential emission of H2O, HCN (10-9) or a combination of both in the spectrum of a quasar at redshift 1.67.",

        "abstract": "Core-collapse supernovae provide a unique opportunity to probe axions because they can be a copious source of the particles. It has recently been proposed that axion helioscopes can be used for the direct search for supernova axions if a supernova event appears within a few hundred parsecs. However, the event number of supernova axions has been estimated only within the post-process framework. In this study, we perform long-term supernova simulations for a 9.6M_sun star coupled with the axion emission to reevaluate the event number of axions detected by the helioscopes. We find that the additional cooling induced by the axion emission can significantly decrease the temperature in the proto-neutron star. As a result, the axion luminosity and hence the axion event number are reduced, compared with the result obtained through post-processing. Our result indicates that the nonlinear feedback of the axion emission is an essential factor to predict the axion detectability, and underscores the need for systematic simulation studies across various progenitor models.",

This star was discovered by the WISPIT survey to have a large multi-ring transitional disk, and is hereafter WISPIT 2. Our H$_{\\alpha}$ images of 2025, April 13 and April 16 discovered an accreting (H$_{\\alpha}$ in emission) protoplanet: WISPIT 2b (r=309.43$\\pm$1.56 mas; (~54 au deprojected), PA=242.21$\\pm$0.41 degrees) likely clearing a dust-free gap between the two brightest dust rings in the transitional disk. Our SNR=12.5 detection gave an H$_{\\alpha}$ ASDI contrast of (6.5$\\pm$0.5)x10$^{-4}$ and a H$_{\\alpha}$ line flux of (1.29$\\pm$0.28)x10$^{-15}$ erg/s/cm$^2$.

WISPIT 2b is accreting at 2.25$^{-0.17}_{+3.75}$x10$^{-12}$ Msun/yr. WISPIT 2b is very similar to the other H$_{\\alpha}$ protoplanets in terms of mass, age, flux, and accretion rate. The inclination of the system (${\\it i}$=44 degrees) is also, surprisingly, very similar to the other known H$\\alpha$ protoplanet systems which all cluster from 37$\\leq{\\it i}\\leq$52 degrees. We argue this clustering has only a ~1.0% (2.6 sigma) probability of occurring randomly, and so we speculate that magnetospherical accretion might have a preferred inclination range (~37-52 degrees) for the direct (cloud free, low extinction) line of sight to the H-alpha line formation/shock region.

        "abstract": "Blazars are promising high-energy neutrino source candidates. Yet, leptohadronic models face challenges in describing neutrino emission within a viable energy budget, and their predictive power is limited by the commonly used single-zone approximation and the reliance on phenomenological parameters. In this work, we present a new leptohadronic model where a sub-Eddington jet evolves from magnetically- to kinetically dominated. A small fraction of the electrons and protons picked up by the jet are continuously accelerated to a power-law spectrum, estimated based on the local magnetic field strength, turbulence, and ambient density, for which we assume power-law profiles. The model parameters are thus directly tied to the jet physics and are comparable in number to typical single-zone models. We then numerically calculate the emission along the jet. Applying the model to the IceCube candidate TXS 0506+056, we find that protons are accelerated to EeV energies in the inner jet, producing a neutrino flux up to order 100 PeV that is consistent with the public 10 year IceCube point-source data. Proton emission at 0.1 pc describes the X-ray and gamma-ray data, while electron emission at the parsec scale describes the optical data. Protons carry a power of about 1% of the Eddington luminosity, showing that the model is energetically viable. The particle spectra follow $E^{-1.8}$, with diffusion scaling as $E^{0.3}$, ruling out Bohm-like diffusion. Additional particle injection near the broad line region can reproduce the 2017 flare associated to a high-energy neutrino. We also apply the model to blazar PKS 0605-085, which may be associated with a recent neutrino detected by KM3NeT above 100 PeV. The results suggest that blazars are efficient neutrino emitters at ultra-high energies, making them prime candidates for future experiments targeting this challenging energy range.",

In this work, we construct rapidly rotating dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) with DM halos using the two-fluid approximation, where the BM and DM interact only through gravity. Our goal is to describe rapidly rotating millisecond-period DANS spun up by the accretion of BM from a zero angular momentum state. We extend the Rapidly Rotating Neutron Star (RNS) code to compute axisymmetric configurations in which the BM rotates rigidly while the DM remains torque-free and differentially rotates through the frame-dragging of spacetime. For the first time, we examine in detail local and global definitions of mass in general relativity for two-fluid systems, showing how their differences affect the interpretation of baryonic and dark component masses. We compute energy density and frame-dragging frequency profiles for DANS with three different characteristic DM halos. We demonstrate that rapid BM rotation reduces DM halo sizes if central energy densities are kept constant between non-rotating and rotating models. We also construct sequences of DANS to create mass and radius curves and compare rotating and non-rotating cases. Finally, we quantify deviations in the spacetime metric outside the baryonic surfaces of these sequences of stars caused by the DM halos. We hypothesize that the size of this quantity could indicate whether a DM halo will significantly impact X-ray pulse profile modeling. These results provide a framework for assessing the observational consequences of DM halos around rapidly rotating NSs.",

        "abstract": "Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a distinct class of stellar explosions, exhibiting peak luminosities 10-100 times brighter than those of normal SNe. Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.",

These are models with Lagrangians that involve higher powers of the kinetic energy $\\dot\\phi^2$, or where the dark matter (DM) mass is a function of $\\phi$. Both have similar features with respect to the reconstructed redshift-dependent $w(z)$: moderate tuning of parameters is required to achieve the desired shape, and it is difficult or impossible for $w(z)$ to continue evolving smoothly as $z$ becomes large. Nevertheless, they give a strong improvement over $\\Lambda$CDM in fitting the data. We point out that models of coupled dark matter and dark energy that cross the phantom divide are under pressure from constraints on long-range DM forces. They rule out the simplest renormalizable coupling of scalar DM to quintessence, but leave the fermionic case marginally allowed, while exponentially coupled models are safe from current constraints.",

        "abstract": "We report the discovery of an exceptionally short burst recurrence time in the well-known clocked burster GS~1826$-$238, observed with the CubeSat X-ray observatory NinjaSat. The source had remained in a persistent soft spectral state since its hard-to-soft transition in 2015 July until a soft-to-hard transition occurred in 2025 May. On 2025 June 23, NinjaSat began monitoring GS~1826$-$238 in the hard state and continued until the source returned to a steady soft state. During this period, we detected 19 X-ray bursts: 14 during the hard state, 4 in the transitional state, and 1 in the soft state. In the hard state, we identified a new clocked bursting epoch, during which the burst recurrence time remained highly stable and unprecedentedly short among the clocked bursting phases of GS~1826$-$238, with $t_{\\rm rec} = 1.603 \\pm 0.040$~hr~($1\\sigma$ error). Furthermore, this recurrence time deviates significantly by approximately~37\\% from the previously established empirical relation $t_{\\rm rec} \\propto F_{\\rm bol}^{-1.05}$, where $F_{\\rm bol}$ is the bolometric persistent flux. These results suggest that the ignition conditions for X-ray bursts differed from those in earlier epochs. We explore possible explanations for this discrepancy and propose a scenario in which a smaller fraction of the neutron star surface was involved in fuel accumulation and nuclear burning. This situation leads to a high local accretion rate compared to earlier epochs, which naturally results in the exceptionally short recurrence time, as well as the observed reductions of approximately 38\\% in blackbody normalization (proportional to the emitting area) and 29\\% in burst fluence.",

This makes them promising candidate sources of neutrinos. In this work, we conduct an association study between 163 SNe IIn observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility and 138 neutrino alert events detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory. After excluding alerts with poor localization, we find two SNe that are spatiotemporally coincident with neutrino events. IC231027A and IC250421A coincide with the positions of SN2023syz and SN2025cbj, respectively, within their localization uncertainties, and the neutrino arrival times are delayed by 38 days and 61 days relative to the discovery times of the corresponding SNe. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that the probability of such two coincidences occurring by chance in our sample is $p \\sim 0.67\\%$, suggesting a high likelihood that they arise from genuine associations, though the result is not yet statistical significant. Furthermore, model calculations show that the expected numbers of neutrino events from these SNe IIn could be consistent with the actual observations.

In this paper, we instead use recombination lines to infer the intrinsic properties of the central engine of LRDs. Our analysis first reveals a tension between the ionizing properties implied from H$\\alpha$ and HeII$\\,\\lambda$4686. The high H$\\alpha$ EWs require copious H-ionizing photons, more than the bluest AGN ionizing spectra can provide. In contrast, HeII emission is marginally detected, and its low EW is, at most, consistent with the softest AGN spectra. The low HeII/H$\\beta$ ($\\sim10^{-2}$, $10$) from gas/dust; and/or soft ionizing spectra with abundant H-ionizing photons, consistent with e.g., a cold accretion disk or a composite of AGN and stars. The latter is an intriguing scenario since high hydrogen densities are highly conducive for star formation, and nuclear star clusters are found in the immediate vicinity of local massive black holes. While previous studies have mostly focused on features dominated by the absorbing hydrogen cloud, the HeII-based diagnostic proposed here represents a crucial step toward understanding the central engine of LRDs.",

We take a significant step further by including the contribution of radiation pressure in the simulations. We model binaries with a total mass of $10^6 \\, M_{\\odot}$, eccentricities $e=0,0.45,0.9$ and mass ratios $q= 0.7, 1$. We find that the radiation pressure significantly alters the vertical and thermal structure of the disc, resulting in a geometrically thinner, therefore colder configuration. This leads to a reduced accretion rate onto the binary and suppresses cavity eccentricity growth and precession in circular equal mass binaries. The binary eccentricity remains approximately constant, while the semi-major axis decreases over time due to net negative torque, regardless of the initial binary orbital parameters.",

        "abstract": "Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) often exhibit broad-line regions (BLRs), populated by high-velocity clouds in Keplerian orbits around the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) at subparsec scales. During episodes of intense super-Eddington accretion, the disk can launch a powerful radiation-driven wind that overtakes the BLR clouds, forming bowshocks. Two shocks arise: one into the wind and another into the cloud. If adiabatic, electrons and protons are efficiently accelerated via Fermi processes to relativistic energies. In dense winds, the resulting high-energy photons are absorbed and reprocessed within the photosphere, while neutrinos from inelastic $pp$ collisions escape. We explore the potential of super-accreting AGNs as neutrino sources and propose a new class of emitter: an AGN without jets or gamma-ray counterparts, but with a strong opaque disk wind. As a case study, we consider a SMBH with $M_{\\rm BH}=10^6,M_{\\odot}$ and accretion rates consistent with tidal disruption events (TDEs). We compute the main cooling processes for relativistic particles and show that super-Eddington SMBHs can produce detectable neutrino fluxes with only weak electromagnetic signatures. Such fluxes may be observable by IceCube-Gen2 in nearby galaxies with a high BLR cloud filling factor. For more massive black holes, detection remains possible with moderate filling factors if the source is close, or at larger distances if the filling factor is high. Our model thus provides a plausible scenario for extragalactic neutrino sources, where both flux and timescale are determined by the number of orbiting clouds and the duration of the super-accreting phase.",

We show that, even at very early times ($\\lesssim 2$ days), regions of ejecta fall below critical density and temperature thresholds at which non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects become important. Here, we present an approximate method for calculating the ionization state of the ejecta that accounts for the NLTE impact of high-energy electrons produced in the beta decay of freshly synthesized $r$-process elements. We find that incorporating ionization from high-energy electrons produces an ``inverted\" and ``blended\" ionization structure, where the most highly ionized species are located in the fastest moving homologous ejecta and multiple ionization states coexist. In radiation transport calculations, the higher degree of ionization reduces line blanketing in optical bands, leading to improved agreement with the light curve properties of AT\\,2017gfo such as the duration, decay rates, brightness, and colors. Our quasi-NLTE implementation helps to alleviate tensions in kilonova modeling: for high-velocity ($\\sim 0.3c$) ejecta components our models require less mass for a given peak brightness in optical bands, by as much as a factor of 3; our models can explain the presence of observed features associated to Sr II, W III, Se III, and Te III under conditions where LTE models would predict only neutral species; and we naturally predict the coexistence of species like Sr II and Ce III without the need for fine-tuning of the ejecta properties.",

We compare superconducting topologies across our collection of EoS and explore the influences of magnetic field geometry in stellar models parameterized by central density. Our models confirm the absence of $S$-wave superconductivity in the inner core and, importantly, reveal that non-superconducting regions exhibit complex three-dimensional geometries: doughnut-shaped for toroidal fields and prolate-shaped for poloidal fields -- spatial structures that are inherently absent from one-dimensional analyses. We also compute magnetic deformations and ellipticities for several millisecond pulsars (MSPs), estimating their continuous gravitational wave (CGW) strain. While these MSPs remain undetectable by current detectors, next-generation instruments such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer may detect their signals, opening an observational window into internal superconductivity and internal magnetic field of NSs, as well as, the fundamental microphysics of dense matter.",

In contrast to the standard scenario, where most of the observable information is encoded in the power spectrum, in this regime the oscillatory signal predominantly appears in higher-order correlation functions with large $n$. This behavior emerges when the oscillation frequency $\\omega$ exceeds the naive cutoff of the theory, $4\\pi f$. However, as noted by Hook and Rattazzi [2306.12489], the actual cutoff is somewhat higher--though only logarithmically--when the amplitude of the oscillations is small. We identify a phenomenologically relevant window in which $n$-point functions with $3 \\lesssim n \\lesssim 9$ are potentially observable. In this regime, the signal exhibits 350 - 1000 oscillations per decade in $k$.",

The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA) mission aims to be limited by thermal Brownian noise in its optics across most target frequencies. By taking advantage of the lunar normal mode resonances, we show that the first phase of the mission, LILA Pioneer, achieves the GW sensitivity required to study astrophysical sources through the millihertz to decihertz range.

In this work, we explore the application of using the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to construct efficient and interpretable neural density estimators for lightweight posterior construction of GW catalogs. By replacing conventional activation functions with learnable splines, KAN achieves superior interpretability, higher accuracy, and greater parameter efficiency on related scientific tasks. Leveraging this feature, we propose a KAN-based neural density estimator, which ingests megabyte-scale GW posterior samples and compresses them into model weights of tens of kilobytes. Subsequently, analytic expressions requiring only several kilobytes can be further distilled from these neural network weights with minimal accuracy trade-off. In practice, GW posterior samples with fidelity can be regenerated rapidly using the model weights or analytic expressions for subsequent analysis. Our lightweight posterior construction strategy is expected to facilitate user-level data storage and transmission, paving a path for efficient analysis of numerous GW events in the next-generation GW detectors.",

AB Aurigae hosts only the second protoplanetary system detected in $H_{\\rm \\alpha}$ thus far and the first with a source showing a spectrum resembling an inverse P Cygni profile.

We present an intensive search for such flares from another 18cow-like event, AT2024wpp. We have used the Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST) to observe this transient between 28 and 74 days after the approximate time of zero flux. The target was observed for about 23 hours to a sensitivity that allows one to detect 3x10^42 erg/s flares at S/N>5. No optical flares have been found, suggesting a one-sided 2-sigma confidence upper limit of <0.02 on the flare's duty cycle, and flare rate lower than about 0.11/hr. These limits suggest that not all 18cow-like objects display a high rate of minute-timescale luminous flares. This can be explained either by diversity in the 18cow-like population or by viewing angle effects (e.g., beaming), or rather that the optical depth towards the central emitting region did not fall below unity during the particular search window.",

We present a polarimetric survey of 17 massive protostellar cluster forming clumps, covered in 34 pointings in the 230-GHz window using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The two array configurations, C43-1 and C43-4, probe linearly polarized dust emission, hence the plane-of-the-sky orientation of magnetic fields, at resolutions of 1\\arcsec\\ and 0\\arcsec.4 that correspond to approximately 0.01pc core and $10^3$ au envelope scales, respectively. The relative orientations (ROs) of the magnetic field probed at two spatial scales are analyzed for the entire protostellar cluster sample and for a subset of objects in NGC 6334. We found a bimodal distribution of ROs with peaks at 0\\deg\\ (parallel) and 90\\deg (orthogonal) for the entire sample combined as well as for NGC 6334. We investigate the physical origin of this bimodal distribution through a projected Rayleigh statistic (PRS) analysis in relation to column densities and local gravity in NGC 6334. We found an excess of parallel magnetic fields at column densities $> 10^{23}$ \\cmm. The underlying cause of the RO distribution of the magnetic field is gravitational collapse at higher gas densities, which drags and reorients the magnetic field as shown in the alignment between the magnetic field and the direction of gravitational forces. The distribution of ROs observed here is consistent with the evolution of relative orientations of an initially sub-Alv\\'enic cloud that becomes magnetically super-critical and super-Alv\\'enic as the cloud collapses to form stars.",

        "abstract": "Context: Observations suggest that magnetic fields of disk-bearing stars may have non-dipolar configurations. However, the influence of these configurations on magnetospheric accretion remains poorly understood. Aims: We aim to simulate magnetospheric accretion incorporating non-dipolar and strong magnetic field. Our model is informed by observations of IRAS 17449+2320, a post-merger belonging to the group of FS CMa stars, which indicate a dominant dipolar magnetic field with an additional quadrupole component. Methods: Using the PLUTO code, we conduct 2.5-D non-ideal viscous-resistive magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of star-disk magnetospheric interactions. We consider a thin accretion disk and strong stellar magnetic field ($B_\\star= 6.2\\mathrm{kG}$) under four configurations: pure dipole, pure quadrupole, dipole plus quadrupole, and dipole plus octupole. In the latter two cases, different magnetic polar strength ratios are explored. Results: For asymmetric magnetic field configurations, we find that accretion exhibits funnel streams below the midplane, indicating the dominance of the quadrupolar and octupolar components. In contrast, in dipolar configurations, we observe the formation of two symmetrical funnels with respect to the midplane. However, in the quadrupolar configuration, accretion is entirely confined to the disk midplane forming a cone-like pattern that leads to disk widening. Remarkably, the presence of a quadrupolar component gives rise to highly asymmetric substructures in the corona region. Conclusions: Multipolar stellar magnetic fields drive non-uniform accretion and lead to asymmetric density distributions in both the disk and corona. These results resemble observed features of some FS CMa post-mergers and Herbig Ae/Be stars, highlighting the critical role of magnetic field complexity in shaping circumstellar environments.",

The morphology of this radio emission is centrally peaked and its extent is well-contained within the SNR shell. A lack of mid- and far-infrared counterparts and the absence of catalogued H II regions argues against a thermal origin, while the morphology and radial profile are suggestive of a PWN origin powered by PSR J1640-4631. Under this assumption, we use a one-zone, time dependant model to reproduce the size and broadband (radio, X-ray, and gamma-rays) spectral energy distribution of the PWN. The modelling and broadband properties of this PWN suggests it is currently interacting with the reverse shock within its host SNR. This evolutionary stage is associated with particles escaping the PWN and entering the ISM, suggesting this object may be an important source of Galactic PeV e+/e-",

Following the methods often used in the context of globular clusters and of clusters of galaxies, we estimate a representative value of the systematic rotation velocity and the position angle of the projected rotation axis for the set of spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies within 1.5 Mpc from the centre of each cluster. We study the robustness of our rotational velocity measurements as a function of the number of galaxies included in the analysis with a bootstrapping technique. Eight clusters with sufficiently abundant and regular data (A1367, A1650, A2029, A2065, A2142, A2199, A2255 and A2670) exhibit a significantly high rotational velocity, when compared to their velocity dispersion ($v_{rot}/\\sigma\\geq 0.15$).

The coherence function C(T) is the metric usually used to determine the viability of a frequency standard. Here we show that C(T) is a useful but not sufficient metric for gauging frequency standard performance in VLBI and instead derive an expression for the clock-limited VLBI visibility S/N. We evaluate this expression for real frequency standards and find only the Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) and hydrogen maser to be viable for upcoming high-frequency VLBI with the USO only useful for very limited integration times (30s at 90 GHz, 10s at 230 GHz, 5s at 345 GHz, and not viable at 630 GHz). The maser extends these, but may have prohivitive size for a space mission. We also evaluate emerging frequency standard technologies and find the Optical Local Oscillator portion of optical clocks to be very promising (conservatively >100s at 90 GHz, 60s at 230 GHz, 40s at 345 GHz, and 22s at 630 GHz) when accounting for both performance and potential operation in space.",

GJ 4334 flared during the observation, starting with a rise in the flux of optical chromospheric emission lines, followed by the rapid rise and decay of multiple far-ultraviolet emission lines formed in the transition region, followed by the slow decay of the optical lines. We find significant broadening and asymmetries in the optical emission lines that are potentially from bulk plasma motion, a post-flare elevated flux in both the optical and far-ultraviolet, and trends in the rise and decay timescales of the Balmer series such that higher-order lines rise earlier and decay faster than lower-order lines. The equivalent durations of the flare in individual lines range from 800 -- 3e4 seconds, mapping to flare energies of 1e28 -- 3e29 erg for each line. To contextualize GJ 4334's flare behavior we measure and compare its optical flare frequency distribution with TESS to EV Lacertae, a similar mass but faster rotating M dwarf, and find that GJ 4334 has an excess of large flares relative to the power-law established by the majority of its smaller flares. This dataset is a rare opportunity to characterize flares near a critical transition in stellar magnetic activity.",

        "abstract": "We propose to search for a faint yet distinguishable contribution to the cosmic infrared background (CIB) spectrum arising from the radiative decay of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\\nu$B). In the Standard Model of particle physics, neutrino decay is highly suppressed, with a predicted lifetime on the order of $10^{43}$ years. However, non-standard models suggest the possibility of significantly shorter lifetimes, ranging from $10^{12}$ to $10^{17}$ years. Observations to date, however, only provide a lower limit of approximately $10^{12}$ years for the neutrino lifetime. In PRIMA's low-resolution mode ($R \\sim 100$), a diffuse background analysis, combined with the removal of point sources associated with known galaxies in a wide-field ($\\sim 1$ square degree) spectroscopic survey covering in the 24-240 $\\mu$m range could facilitate a search for neutrino decay lifetimes up to $O(10^{15})$ years. The expected signal from C$\\nu$B decay at 50 $\\mu$m for a neutrino lifetime of $O(10^{15})$ years is more than an order of magnitude fainter than the CIB and over three orders of magnitude fainter than the zodiacal emission foreground. Taking advantage of the characteristic spectral features of C$\\nu$B decay, this level of sensitivity can be achieved with approximately 100 hours of total observation time, based on estimated surface brightness sensitivity. Searching for neutrino decay at this sensitivity could place strong constraints on several non-standard theories. A positive detection would provide compelling evidence for non-standard contributions to neutrino decay and could directly reveal the cosmic neutrino background. Furthermore, the decay photon spectrum could offer insights into the absolute mass of neutrinos, and key cosmological parameters.",

Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.",

While $\\xi$ is often assumed to be constant, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a time-dependent coupling, which could provide a more general and realistic description of dark sector dynamics. In this work, we study two widely used interacting models involving pressureless DM and DE, where the coupling parameter is allowed to vary with the scale factor $a$. Specifically, we consider two parametrizations: $\\xi(a) = \\xi_0 + \\xi_a (1-a)$ and $\\xi(a) = \\xi_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{1-a}{a^2 + (1-a)^2} \\right)$, and constrain them using the latest cosmological observations, including Planck 2018 CMB data, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and multiple Type Ia supernovae samples. Our results show that one scenario yields evidence for a non-zero interaction at more than 95\\% confidence level, while the remaining cases indicate at most mild or inconclusive signs of interaction.

The coma is dust-dominated with a fairly constant red optical continuum slope ($\\sim$21-22\\%/1000\\AA).

Energetic considerations of activation barriers show that this behavior is inconsistent with direct sublimation of canonical metal/sulfide phases and instead favors low-activation-energy release from dust, e.g. photon-stimulated desorption or mild thermolysis of metalated organics or Ni-rich nanophases, possibly including Ni-carbonyl-like complexes. These hypotheses are testable with future coordinated ground-based and space-based monitoring as 3I becomes more active during its continued passage through the solar system.",

        "abstract": "Tidal interactions are one of the primary drivers of orbital evolution for massive planets with short orbital periods. Tidal dissipation within host stars can cause the orbits of such planets to decay. However, the mechanisms of tidal dissipation are difficult to probe. Generally, tidal dissipation is parameterized by the modified stellar tidal quality factor, or $Q_{*}^{'}$, but the lack of observational evidence of orbital decay to confirm dissipation theories has resulted in orders of magnitude of uncertainty in $Q_{*}^{'}$. We present a new transit timing analysis of 54 systems with varying stellar evolutionary states in an attempt to search for orbital decay across multiple stages of stellar evolution. For each system, we obtained mid-transit times from new TESS data and evaluated potential departures from a linear ephemeris using the Bayesian Information Criterion. We then determined tidal quality factors using widely tested theoretical relations. Of the systems studied, 25 showed evidence of a decrease in orbital period over time and 8 showed evidence of a decrease that was inconsistent with 0 by three standard deviations: CoRoT-2, TrES-5, WASP-4, WASP-12, WASP-19, WASP-45, WASP-99, and XO-3. However, the significance of some of these detections may be influenced by unreliable transit time measurements. Similarly, we see that the lower limit on $Q_{*}^{'}$ for evolved systems is marginally lower than it is for the sample of all systems, though both limits are orders of magnitude below the expected theoretical values for both samples. These new constraints on transit times and $Q_{*}^{'}$ values will help to narrow the search for orbital decay in the future and place important constraints on current theories of star-planet interactions.",

        "abstract": "The shape and dynamics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) vary significantly based on the instrument and wavelength used. This has led to significant debate about the proper definitions of CME/shock fronts, pile-up/compression regions, and cores observations in projection in optically thin vs. optically thick emission. Here we present an observational analysis of the evolving shape and kinematics of a large-scale CME that occurred on May 7, 2021 on the eastern limb of the Sun as seen from 1 au. The eruption was observed continuously, consecutively by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) telescope suite on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the ground-based COronal Solar Magnetism Observatory (COSMO) K-coronagraph (K-Cor) on Mauna Loa, and the C2 and C3 tele- scopes of the Large Angle Solar Coronagraph (LASCO) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO). We apply the updated multi-instument version of the recently de- veloped Wavetrack Python suite for automated detection and tracking of coronal eruptive features to evaluate and compare the evolving shape of the CME front as it propagated from the solar surface out to 20 solar radii. Our tool allows tracking features beyond just the leading edge and is an important step towards semi-automatic manufacturing of train- ing sets for training data-driven image segmentation models for solar imaging. Our findings confirm the expected strong connection between EUV waves and CMEs. Our novel, de- tailed analysis sheds observational light on the details of EUV wave-shock-CME relations that is lacking for the gap region between the low and middle corona.",

        "title": "Observations of Successive CMEs and their Successive Type II Solar Radio Bursts in the Corona",
        "abstract": "This paper reports the observations of two coronal shocks from two Coronal Mass   Ejections (CMEs) for the Successive type II Solar radio bursts observed on 02   May 2021 in the frequency range of 80 - 1 MHz with the time interval of ~ 20   minutes between them. Both the bursts show clear band splitting features in the   harmonic band. The estimated heights for the source of the first type II burst lies   in the range of 2.06 - 2.93 R0 with the average speeds of 601 + or - 76, 700 + or - 91   and 783 + or - 105 km/s for 2 X, 3.5 X and 5 X Saito electron density models, and   the heights for the source of the second type II burst lies in the range of 2.24 -   3.83 R0 with the average speeds of 1063 + or - 113, 1287 + or - 145 and 1478 + or - 172 km/s. The successive CMEs are observed by the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations   Observatory STEREO-A between 11:20 - 12:21 UT in the Extreme Ultra Violet   Imager (EUVI) and in the Internally Occulting Refractive Coronagraphs (COR1)   FOV, the two coronal shocks are generated by the two successive CMEs observed   at (11:30) 11:26 UT and (11:55:00) 11:56 UT according to ST-A (EUVI) COR1   observations and most likely released from the same active region. The average   speeds of CMEs at COR1 FOV are about 574 = or - 64 km/s and 595 + or - 82   km/s. The simultaneous observations of the EUV structures and the radio   bursts, their coinciding height-time further confirms that the successive CMEs are   responsible for the successive shocks and their related radio bursts in the corona.   The observed band-splitting in the successive type-II radio bursts provides the   compression ratios of 1.26 and 1.45 respectively. Therefore, these observations   confirms the presence of shock waves in the corona.",

        "abstract": "The solar corona is much hotter than the photosphere and chromosphere, but the physical mechanism responsible for heating the coronal plasma remains unidentified yet. The thermal microwave emission, which is produced in strong magnetic field above sunspots, is a promising but barely exploited tool for studying the coronal magnetic field and plasma. We analyzed the microwave observations of eight solar active regions obtained with the Siberian Radioheliograph in years 2022-2024 in the frequency range of 6-12 GHz. We produced synthetic microwave images based on various coronal heating models, and determined the model parameters that provided the best agreement with the observations. The observations and simulations strongly favour either a steady-state (continuous) plasma heating process, or high-frequency heating by small energy release events with a short cadence. The average magnetic field strength in a coronal loop was found to decrease with the loop length, following a scaling law with the most probable index of about -0.55. In the majority of cases, the estimated volumetric heating rate was weakly dependent on the magnetic field strength, and decreased with the coronal loop length following a scaling law with the index of about -2.5. Among the known theoretical heating mechanisms, the model based on wave transmission or reflection in coronal loops acting as resonance cavities was found to provide the best agreement with the observations. The obtained results did not demonstrate a significant dependence on the emission frequency in the considered range.",

        "abstract": "Scalar fields with non-trivial kinetic term derived from a nonlinear sigma model are motivated by UV completions of gravity such as string theory. We discuss the $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ and $\\mathrm{O}(3)$ sigma models with interacting potentials and simulate their full nonlinear dynamics on black hole spacetimes. We study the properties of the field as a function of the curvature of the sigma model with respect to the free massive scalar case. In the accretion process, the $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ model behaves as a self-interacting field with attractive interaction, while the $\\mathrm{O}(3)$ one exhibits a repulsive phenomenology. In the case of a binary black hole system, these models cause a positive or negative dephasing of the gravitational waveform, respectively, when compared to the non-interacting case and as long as the field's Compton wavelength is larger than the binary separation. We observe no bosenova emission, which suggests that nonlinearities tend to suppress this phenomenon. Our results highlight how the kinetic and potential terms are both relevant in determining the field dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Bibliometric methods provide valuable tools for assessing scientific productivity and impact across disciplines, yet their application in astronomy journals remains relatively limited. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of Japanese astronomy publications before and after the commissioning of the Subaru Telescope, a major national investment in observational infrastructure. Using data from Scopus and SciVal, we examine peer-reviewed journal articles published between 1996 and 2007 by authors affiliated with Japanese institutions, focusing on field-normalized citation indicators such as the Field-Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) and the share of publications in the top 10% most cited globally. Subaru Telescope-based publications are identified through cross-referencing with official telescope publication lists and are compared against national and global benchmarks. The results show that Subaru Telescope-based publications, while accounting for less than 10% of Japan's total scholarly output in astronomy, consistently achieved FWCI values above 2.0 and a significantly higher proportion of highly cited papers. This indicates that the Subaru Telescope substantially enhanced Japan's research visibility and impact, especially during its early operational years. This study demonstrates the utility of bibliometric evaluation in capturing the academic return of large-scale research facilities and contributes to broader discussions on research infrastructure in astronomy.",

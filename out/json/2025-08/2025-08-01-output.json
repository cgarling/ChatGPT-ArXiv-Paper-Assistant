        "abstract": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled unexpectedly massive galaxy candidates at high redshifts, challenging standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological predictions. In this work, we study the predictions of more realistic dark matter halo models combined with modified matter power spectra for interpreting JWST observations of high-redshift galaxies. We employ three halo mass functions: the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) model and two physically motivated alternatives introduced by Del Popolo (DP1 and DP2). Our analysis of cumulative stellar mass densities at $z \\simeq 8$--$10$ reveals that the standard ST mass function systematically underpredicts JWST observations, achieving marginal consistency only with high star formation efficiencies. In contrast, the DP1 and DP2 models demonstrate significantly improved agreement with observations even within standard $\\Lambda$CDM, with statistical consistency within $1$--$2\\sigma$ for moderate star formation efficiencies. When combined with modified power spectra, these refined halo models achieve suitable agreement with JWST data across broad parameter ranges, particularly for steeper spectral indices that amplify high-mass halo formation. Crucially, we find that moderate star formation efficiencies coupled with small-scale power enhancements provide robust reconciliation between theory and observations, eliminating the need for extreme astrophysical assumptions. Our results demonstrate that incorporating realistic halo collapse physics, often neglected in standard analyses, can substantially alleviate apparent tensions between JWST observations and $\\Lambda$CDM predictions, highlighting the critical importance of small-scale structure formation physics in early cosmic epochs.",

        "abstract": "Inferences from observations clearly show that mixing in stars extends beyond the convective boundaries defined by mixing length theory. This triggered the proposal of a variety of prescriptions to include additional mixing in stellar models. These prescriptions typically introduce free parameters to set the extent of the additional mixing and may also introduce numerical parameters. In the case of exponential overshooting, one must decide the threshold at which the exponential decay of the mixing coefficient can be treated as zero. Using the MESA stellar evolution code, I explore the effect of varying this parameter on asteroseismic models of main-sequence stars with growing convective cores. From this, I conclude that overshoot_D_min should be set to $10^{-2}$ cm$^2$/s or lower for these stars. The default value in MESA is four orders of magnitude higher than this recommendation, which results in discontinuous evolution.",

Such recipes contain free parameters that are calibrated comparing the simulations against observations, but the creation of galaxy mocks is a stochastic process with a large number of free parameters to calibrate. We present a new pipeline, based on the differential evolution algorithm, that can calibrate galaxy mocks in a fully automated way for realistic scenarios with a large parameter space. We apply the pipeline to galaxy mocks built on a combination of halo occupation distribution and sub-halo abundance matching techniques. We show that our pipeline can properly calibrate the galaxy mocks against observations for both $\\Lambda$CDM and modified gravity halo catalogues.

        "abstract": "Understanding the Milky Way disc formation requires characterising its structural and kinematic properties as functions of stellar age. Using red giant stars from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia DR3, we model the age-dependent stellar kinematics with a quasi-isothermal distribution function and fit disc parameters as a function of age using non-parametric splines. We identify a transition from thick to thin disc populations around 10 Gyr ago. Stars older than this have short scale lengths ($\\sim$1.7 kpc), typical of the thick disc, while younger stars exhibit increasing scale length with decreasing age, consistent with inside-out formation of the thin disc. This transition coincides with the end of the starburst triggered by the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger. Stars formed around 10 Gyr ago exhibit a dip in scale length, even shorter than that of the thick disc. Comparison with an Auriga simulation suggests that this scale-length dip reflects gas disc shrinking caused by the transition from a cold to hot gas accretion mode. We propose the following disc formation scenario: (1) the thick disc formed under cold-mode accretion; (2) the GSE merger triggered a starburst and increased the total mass of the Galaxy, causing the transition to hot-mode accretion; (3) rapid gas consumption led to temporary shrinking of the star-forming gas disc; and then (4) thin disc grows in an inside-out fashion, as the size of the star-forming gas disc grows via hot-mode smooth gas accretion.",

Employing new full radiative transfer hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, we investigate the local and intergalactic feedback of SMBH progenitors for the Population III.1 scenario, i.e., efficient formation of supermassive stars from pristine, undisturbed dark matter minihalos. Our cosmological simulations capture the R-type expansion phase of these Pop III.1 stars, with their H-ionizing photon luminosities of $\\sim10^{53}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}$ generating HII regions that extend deep into the intergalactic medium, reaching comoving radii of $r_{\\rm HII}\\sim 1\\,{\\rm cMpc}$. We vary both the Pop III.1 ionization flux and cosmological formation environments, finding the former regulates their final $r_{\\rm HII}$, whereas the latter is more important in setting their formation redshift. We use the results from our radiation-hydrodynamics simulations to estimate the cosmic number density of SMBHs, $n_{\\rm SMBH}$, expected from Pop III.1 progenitors. We find $n_{\\rm SMBH}\\sim10^{-1}\\,{\\rm cMpc}^{-3}$, consistent with the results inferred from recent observations of the local and high redshift universe. Overall, this establishes Pop III.1 progenitors as viable candidates for the formation of the first SMBHs, and emphasises the importance of exploring heavy mass seed scenarios.",

We show that the presence of extra polarization modes modifies both the amplitude and angular dependence of the correlation functions. Furthermore, we identify a distinct observational channel for probing parity violation in helicity-two and helicity-one modes. In particular, we show that if they propagate at different speeds, galaxy surveys can disentangle the source of parity violation.

        "abstract": "The relation between the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies encodes information on their mode of growth, especially at the earliest epochs. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened such investigations by detecting the host galaxies of AGN and more luminous quasars within the first billion years of the universe (z > 6). Here, we evaluate the relation between the mass of SMBHs and the total stellar mass of their host galaxies using a sample of nine quasars at 6.18 < z < 6.4 from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) survey with NIRCam and NIRSpec observations. We find that the observed location of these quasars in the SMBH-galaxy mass plane (log MBH ~ 8-9; log M* ~9.5-11) is consistent with a non-evolving intrinsic mass relation with dispersion (0.80_{-0.28}^{+0.23} dex) higher than the local value (~0.3-0.4 dex). Our analysis is based on a forward model of systematics and includes a consideration of the impact of selection effects and measurement uncertainties, an assumption on the slope of the mass relation, and finds a reasonable AGN fraction (2.3%) of galaxies at z ~ 6 with an actively growing UV-unobscured black hole. In particular, models with a substantially higher normalisation in MBH would require an unrealistically low intrinsic dispersion (~0.22 dex) and a lower AGN fraction (~0.6%). Consequently, our results predict a large population of AGNs at lower black hole masses, as are now just starting to be discovered in focused efforts with JWST.",

        "abstract": "Among high-redshift galaxies, aside from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), X-ray binaries (XRBs) can be significant sources of X-ray emission. XRBs play a crucial role in galaxy evolution, reflecting the stellar populations of galaxies and regulating star formation through feedback, thereby shaping galaxy structure. In this study, we report a spectroscopically confirmed X-ray emitting galaxy pair (UDF3 and UDF3-2) at $z = 2.544$. By combining multi-wavelength observations from JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectra, JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging, Chandra, HST, VLT, ALMA, and VLA, we analyze the ionized emission lines, which are primarily driven by H II region-like processes. Additionally, we find that the mid-infrared radiation can be fully attributed to dust emission from galaxy themselves. Our results indicate that the X-ray emission from these two galaxies is dominated by high-mass XRBs, with luminosities of $L_X= (1.43\\pm0.40) \\times 10^{42} \\, \\text{erg} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$ for UDF3, and $(0.40\\pm0.12) \\times 10^{42} \\, \\text{erg} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$ for UDF3-2. Furthermore, we measure the star formation rate (SFR) of $529_{-88}^{+64}$ $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for UDF3, placing it $\\approx$ 0.5 dex below the $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation. This offset reflects the redshift-dependent enhancement of $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation, which is influenced by metallicity and serves as a key observable for XRB evolution. In contrast, UDF3-2, with the SFR of $34_{-6}^{+6}$ $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, aligns well with the $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation. This galaxy pair represents the highest-redshift non-AGN-dominated galaxies with individual X-ray detections reported to date. This finding suggests that the contribution of XRBs to galaxy X-ray emission at high redshift may be underestimated.",

        "abstract": "Simulation-based inference (SBI) allows fast Bayesian inference for simulators encoding implicit likelihoods. However, some explicit likelihoods cannot be easily reformulated as simulators, hindering their integration into combined analyses within SBI frameworks. One key example in cosmology is given by the Planck CMB likelihoods. We present a simple method to construct an effective simulator for any explicit likelihood using samples from a previously converged Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) run. This effective simulator can subsequently be combined with any forward simulator. To illustrate this method, we combine the full Planck CMB likelihoods with a 3x2pt simulator (cosmic shear, galaxy clustering and their cross-correlation) for a Stage IV survey like Euclid, and test evolving dark energy parameterized by the $w_0w_a$ equation-of-state. Assuming the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology hinted by DESI BAO DR2 + Planck 2018 + PantheonPlus SNIa datasets, we find that future 3x2pt data alone could detect evolving dark energy at $5\\sigma$, while its combination with current CMB, BAO and SNIa datasets could raise the detection to almost $7\\sigma$. Moreover, thanks to simulation reuse enabled by SBI, we show that our joint analysis is in excellent agreement with MCMC while requiring zero Boltzmann solver calls. This result opens up the possibility of performing massive global scans combining explicit and implicit likelihoods in a highly efficient way.",

In this work, we point out a fundamental inconsistency in the conventional treatment of $N_{\\rm eff}$ in big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), particularly regarding its applicability to new physics scenarios where $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$, the deviation of $N_{\\rm eff}$ from the standard BBN prediction, is negative. To ensure consistent interpretation, it is imperative to either restrict the allowed range of $N_{\\rm eff}$ or systematically adjust neutrino-induced reaction rates based on physically motivated assumptions. As a concrete example, we consider a simple scenario in which a negative $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$ arises from entropy injection into the electromagnetic sector due to the decay of long-lived particles after neutrino decoupling. This process dilutes the neutrino density and suppresses the rate of neutrino-driven neutron-proton conversion. Under this assumption, we demonstrate that the resulting BBN constraints on $N_{\\rm eff}$ deviate significantly from those obtained by the conventional, but unphysical, extrapolation of dark radiation scenarios into the $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff} < 0$ regime.",

        "abstract": "We consider if outflowing winds that are detected via narrow absorption lines (NALs) with FWHM of $<$ 500 km/s (i.e., NAL outflows) in quasar spectra contribute to feedback. As our sample, we choose 11 NAL systems in eight optically luminous quasars from the NAL survey of Misawa et al. (2007a), based on the following selection criteria: i) they exhibit ``partial coverage'' suggesting quasar origin (i.e., intrinsic NALs), ii) they have at least one low-ionization absorption line (C II and/or Si II), and iii) the Ly$\\alpha$ absorption line is covered by available spectra. The results depend critically on this selection method, which has caveats and uncertainties associated with it, as we discuss in a dedicated section of the paper. Using the column density ratio of the excited and ground states of C II and Si II, we place upper limits on the electron density as $n_{\\rm e}$ $ 79$ - (3.1$\\times 10^{5})$ and $\\log(\\dot{E_{\\rm k}}/{\\rm erg~s}^{-1}) > 42.9$ - 49.8, respectively. Taking the NAL selection and these results at face value, the inferred feedback efficiency can be comparable to or even larger than those of broad absorption line and other outflow classes, and large enough to generate significant AGN feedback. However, the question of the connection of quasar-driven outflows to NAL absorbers at large distances from the central engine remains open and should be addressed by future theoretical work.",

The earlier studies of the optical environment suggested that the source could be located in a galaxy cluster or a group. However, we report a non-detection of hot gas on large scales (out to $\\sim 60$ kpc radius) and place an upper limit on the X-ray luminosity of $<3\\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, consistent only with the presence of a poor, low-temperature ($\\rm kT < 0.5$ keV) galaxy group. X-ray spectral analysis of the central circular region, $r<7$ kpc shows, in addition to the mildly absorbed AGN, a thermal emission component with a temperature of $\\rm kT=0.9^{+0.19}_{-0.37}$ keV. We discuss the origin of this hot component as a result of interaction between the evolving radio source and the interstellar medium. Our high angular resolution X-ray image traces the distribution of hot gas which is closely aligned with and extends beyond the radio source, and also in the direction perpendicular to the radio source axis. The X-rays are enhanced at the northern radio lobe and the location of the peak of the CO(3-2)/CO(2-1) line emission, suggesting that the interactions between the jet and cold medium result in the X-ray radiation which excites CO. The shock driven by the jet into the ISM is supersonic with the Mach number of $\\mathcal{M} \\sim 1.75-2$, creating the cocoon of hot X-rays surrounding the radio source. This result agrees with observations of shocks in other radio galaxies pointing to a prevalent impact of jets on ISM.",

        "abstract": "The young neutron star X-ray binary, Cir X-1, resides within its natal supernova remnant and experiences ongoing outbursts every 16.5 days, likely due to periastron passage in an eccentric orbit. We present the deepest ever radio image of the field, which reveals relativistic jet-punched bubbles that are aligned with the mean axis of the smaller-scale jets observed close to the X-ray binary core. We are able to measure the minimum energy for the bubble, which is around $E_{min}$ = $10^{45} $ erg. The nature and morphological structure of the source were investigated through spectral index mapping and numerical simulations. The spectral index map reveals a large fraction of the nebula's radio continuum has a steep slope, associated with optically thin synchrotron emission, although there are distinct regions with flatter spectra. Our data are not sensitive enough to measure the spectral index of the protruding bubbles. We used the PLUTO code to run relativistic hydrodynamic simulations to try and qualitatively reproduce the observations with a combined supernova-plus-jet system. We are able to do so using a simplified model in which the asymmetrical bubbles are best represented by supernova explosion which is closely followed (within 100 years) by a phase of very powerful jets lasting less than 1000 years. These are the first observations revealing the initial breakout of neutron star jets from their natal supernova remnant, and further support the scenario in which Cir X-1 is a younger relation of the archetypal jet source SS433.",

Due to Pauli blocking as electrons become degenerate at sufficiently high accretion rates $\\dot{M}$, the resulting 'self-neutronization' of the dissociated accreting plasma makes these astrophysical systems promising sources of rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis (the r-process). We present a one-dimensional general-relativistic, viscous-hydrodynamic model of neutrino-cooled accretion disks around black holes. With collapsars, super-collapsars and very massive star collapse in mind, we chart the composition of the accretion flow and systematically explore different radiatively efficient and inefficient accretion regimes with increasing $\\dot M$, across a vast parameter space of $\\dot{M}\\sim 10^{-6}-10^6 M_\\odot \\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, black hole masses of $M_\\bullet\\sim 1 - 10^4 M_\\odot$ and dimensionless spins of $\\chi_\\bullet \\in [0,1)$, as well as $\\alpha$-viscosity values of $\\alpha\\sim 10^{-3}-1$.

We focus our analysis on perturbations on a Minkowski background, elucidating how derivatives of the energy momentum tensor can sustain non-trivial torsion and non-metricity excitations, eventually resulting in additional source terms for the metric field. These can be reorganized in the form of D'Alembert operator acting on the energy momentum tensor and the equivalence principle can be reinforced at the linear level by a suitable choice of the parameters of the model. We show how tensor polarizations can exhibit a subluminal phase velocity in matter, evading the constraints found in General Relativity, and how this allows for the kinematic damping in specific configurations of the medium and of the geometry-matter coupling. These in turn define regions in the wavenumber space where propagation is forbidden, leading to the appearance of typical cut-off scale in the frequency spectrum.",

        "abstract": "In General Relativity, the static tidal Love numbers of black holes vanish identically. Whether this remains true for time-dependent tidal fields -- i.e., in the case of dynamical tidal Love numbers -- is an open question, complicated by subtle issues in the definition and computation of the tidal response at finite frequency. In this work, we compute the dynamical tidal perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole to quadratic order in the tidal frequency. By employing the Teukolsky formalism in advanced null coordinates, which are regular at the horizon, we obtain a particularly clean perturbative scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a response function based on the full solution of the perturbation equation which does not depend on any arbitrary constant. Our analysis recovers known results for the dissipative response at linear order and the logarithmic running at quadratic order, associated with scale dependence in the effective theory. In addition, we find a finite, nonvanishing conservative correction at second-order in frequency, thereby possibly demonstrating a genuine dynamical deformation of the black hole geometry. We then assess the impact of these dynamical tidal effects on the gravitational-wave phase, which enter at 8th post-Newtonian order, and express the correction in terms of generic $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients, which have to be matched to the perturbative result. Despite their conceptual interest, we argue that such corrections are too small to be observable even with future-generation gravitational wave detectors. Moreover, the corresponding phase shifts are degenerate with unknown point-particle contributions entering at the same post-Newtonian order.",

In the UV, the field possesses a global $U(1)$ symmetry which is broken by mass terms and Higgs portal interactions. In the mass basis, the complex field splits into a pair of real scalars with a small mass splitting (in analogy to pseudo-Dirac fermions), such that the Higgs portal acquires both diagonal and off-diagonal terms with respect to these eigenstates. In the parameter space where the off-diagonal interaction predominates, this scenario is safe from direct detection constraints. Moreover, this model provides a viable explanation for the longstanding Galactic Center gamma-ray excess. Additionally, this model influences the Higgs potential in a way that could facilitate a strong first-order electroweak phase transition in the early universe, potentially leading to a stochastic gravitational wave background that could fall within the reach of upcoming space-based detectors.",

In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the FRB population using the first CHIME/FRB catalog, focusing on their energy and redshift distribution, with careful consideration of selection effects. We investigate a range of models, including the Schechter function and the broken power-law function for the energy distribution, and several redshift evolution models, such as the star formation history (SFH) model, as well as models incorporating time delays relative to the SFH or additional redshift evolution factors. Our results indicate that the energy distribution of FRBs is best described by the Schechter function, with a power-law index of $\\gamma = -1.49^{+0.37}_{-0.27}$ and a characteristic cutoff energy of $E_\\mathrm{c} = 2.82^{+2.43}_{-1.47} \\times 10^{41}$ erg. Furthermore, we find no evidence for redshift evolution in the energy distribution of FRBs. In terms of their redshift distribution, our analysis shows that it follows the cosmic SFH, without requiring additional delayed components or redshift evolution factors, suggesting that most FRBs likely originate from young stellar populations. Simultaneously, we infer a local volumetric rate of $\\Phi_0 = 4.68^{+4.66}_{-2.39} \\times 10^{4} \\rm \\ Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ for $E>10^{39}$ erg.

        "abstract": "Recent JWST observations have revealed a puzzling population of optically red and compact galaxies with peculiar \"V\"-shaped spectra at high redshift, known as \"Little Red Dots\" (LRDs). Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs are found at z > 4 and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early stages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at z = 0.1, which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in an JWST-selected LRD at z = 2.26. We find small but statistically significant variability in H$\\alpha$ consistent with previous findings. Finally, with the new X-ray observation from NuSTAR, we confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with $N_{\\rm H}>10^{24}~{\\rm cm^{-2}}$. All evidence suggests SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 has a complex gaseous environment and the strong ionic, atomic, and molecular absorptions are hard to explain with typical stellar and AGN models.",

Although limited theoretical investigations on the origin of the filamentary structures have associated these filaments with astrophysical shocks and interactions with intracluster magneto-ionic media, more quantitative studies are needed to ascertain their precise nature and origin. Recent MeerKAT observations found peculiar filamentary structures (threaded radio structures) joining the lobes of a nearby FRII-like galaxy, ESO 137-006. Here we investigate the origin of these \"synchrotron threads\" to understand if they may be confined magnetically and could arise due to shocks associated with jet activity. Through simulation- and theory-based analysis, we find that the dynamical time (~70 Myr) associated with the shock front closely matches the estimated synchrotron age (~130 Myr) of the threads, thus making the shock origin hypothesis a favorable scenario for this particular filament.",

        "abstract": "Pulses from the Crab pulsar are often followed by ``echoes'', produced by radiation that was deflected by small filamentary structures in the Crab nebula and thus traveled via longer paths. We describe a simplified but detailed model that treats the filaments as cylinders of dense, neutral material with a thin ionized skin. In this picture, echoes are produced when the line of sight crosses the skin at glancing incidence, which naturally leads to the large electron column density gradients required to get the observed delays even with electron densities comparable to those inferred from optical line emission ratios. We compare the properties of the predicted echoes with those of a relatively isolated observed one identified during daily monitoring with CHIME. We find that the delays of the simulated echoes follow closely the near quadratic evolution known to be a feature of these echoes, and that, unlike in previous models, we match the characteristic observed asymmetry between incoming and outgoing arcs, with the size of the gap in between a consequence of the skin crossing time. However, our model fails to quantitatively reproduce the magnifications of the echoes. We believe this likely is because the filaments are not as smooth as envisaged, so that a given echo results from many images. Nevertheless, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the nebula is filled with small-scale filamentary structures, which may well be substructures of the larger filaments that are seen in optical images.",

Detectable eccentricity provides a powerful diagnostic for distinguishing between different formation channels, but resolving their eccentricity distributions requires the detection of a large number of eccentric mergers. Future gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will detect tens of thousands of BBH mergers out to redshifts $z \\ge 10$, making it critical to understand the redshift-dependent evolution of eccentricity distributions. We simulate this evolution for two key channels: dynamical assembly in globular clusters (GCs), which leads to rapid, eccentric mergers; and hierarchical triples in the field, where three-body dynamics can induce eccentricity in the inner binary. When considering all BBH mergers, the GC channel dominates overall, consistent with previous studies. However, when focusing on mergers with detectable eccentricity in next-generation detectors, we find that hierarchical triples dominate the eccentric merger rate at $0\\le z \\le 4$, with GC mergers becoming competitive at higher redshifts. Across all model variations, eccentric mergers in the local Universe ($z\\lesssim 1$) have significant contributions from field triples, challenging the common view that such systems primarily form in dense environments. We show that, regardless of cluster and stellar evolution uncertainties, hierarchical triples contribute at least 30 per cent of eccentric mergers across a large range of redshifts.",

The scenario we simulate assumes that a strong binary interaction enhanced the mass loss rate from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar progenitor of NGC 1514, and shortly thereafter, the main-sequence companion accreted mass from the AGB star, launching a pair of jets. We find that adiabatic flows, where radiative losses are negligible, produce prominent rings, as observed in the infrared in NGC 1514. In contrast, when radiative cooling is significant, the rings are thin and faint. Our results reinforce the prevailing notion that jets play a substantial role in shaping planetary nebulae (PNe). More generally, as the binary companion to the central star of NGC 1514 avoided common envelope evolution, our results suggest that jets play a major role in many binary systems experiencing stable mass transfer at high rates. This conclusion complements the view that jets play a significant role in unstable mass transfer, specifically in common envelope evolution. Studies of strongly interacting binary systems, whether stable or not, should include jets. If jets continue to be active after ring formation, the outcomes are circum-jet rings, as observed in some other PNe and core-collapse supernova remnants.",

        "abstract": "We present the most up-to-date constraints on axion early dark energy (AEDE) from cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. In particular, we assess the impact of data from ground-based CMB experiments, the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) -- both with and without $Planck$ -- on constraints on AEDE. We also highlight the impact that BAO information from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has on these constraints. From CMB data alone, we do not find statistically significant evidence for the presence of AEDE, and we find only moderate reduction in the Hubble tension. From the latest SPT data alone, we find the maximal fractional contribution of AEDE to the cosmic energy budget is $f_{\\rm EDE}\\,<\\,0.12$ at $95\\,$% confidence level (CL), and the Hubble tension between the SPT and SH0ES results is reduced to the $2.3\\,\\sigma$ level. When combining the latest SPT, ACT, and $Planck$ datasets, we find $f_{\\rm EDE}\\,<\\,0.091$ at $95\\,$% CL and the Hubble tension at the $3.3\\, \\sigma$ level. In contrast, adding DESI data to the CMB datasets results in mild preference for AEDE and, in some cases, non-negligible reduction in the Hubble tension. From SPT+DESI, we find $f_{\\rm EDE}\\,=\\,0.081^{+0.037}_{-0.052}$ at $68\\,$% CL, and the Hubble tension reduces to $1.5\\,\\sigma$. From the combination of DESI with all three CMB experiments, we get $f_{\\rm EDE}\\,=\\, 0.071^{+0.035}_{-0.038}$ at $68\\,$% CL and a weak preference for AEDE over $\\Lambda$CDM. This data combination, in turn, reduces the Hubble tension to $2.3\\, \\sigma$. We highlight that this shift in parameters when adding the DESI dataset is a manifestation of the discrepancy currently present between DESI and CMB experiments in the concordance model $\\Lambda$CDM.",

        "abstract": "Theoretical models have long predicted the existence of shocks in multi-transonic accretion flows onto a black hole, yet their fate under realistic general relativistic simulations has not been fully tested. In this study, we present results from high-resolution two-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of low-angular-momentum accretion flows onto Kerr black holes, focusing on the formation of shocks in transonic accretion flow. We demonstrate that for specific combinations of energy and angular momentum, global shock solutions naturally emerge between multiple sonic points. These shocks are sustained in both corotating and counter-rotating cases, and their locations depend on specific energy, angular momentum, and the spin of the black hole which is in good agreement with analytical solutions. In magnetized flows, weak magnetic fields preserve the shock structure, whereas strong fields suppress it, enhancing turbulence and driving powerful, magnetically dominated jets/outflows. The strength and structure of the outflow also depend on a black hole spin and magnetization, with higher black hole spin parameters leading to faster jets. Shock solutions are found only in super-Alfv\\'{e}nic regions, where kinetic forces dominate. Our findings provide important insights into the physics of hot corona formation and jet launching in low-angular-momentum accretion systems such as Sgr~A$^*$ (weak jet/outflow) and X-ray binaries.",

This has significant implications for source identification, as the deflections of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) are larger for heavy primaries than for lighter ones at the same energy. In this work, we assume that cosmic rays above 40 EeV consist of iron nuclei only and investigate their possible sources through simulations of cosmic ray propagation, including interactions with ambient photon fields and deflections in the GMF using multiple models. We consider two types of sources as potential origins of these cosmic rays, active galactic nuclei and starburst galaxies. We compare the predicted distributions of arrival directions from sources within 250 Mpc with the measured arrival directions of cosmic rays above 40 EeV. Our results indicate that stronger correlation is found for the active galactic nuclei scenario compared to starburst galaxies. However, we find that within our heavy mass composition model, the GMF leads to significant deflections, making source identification challenging with current knowledge and tools, even at the highest energies.",

To ensure that the model conforms with reality, physics-informed constraints are embedded directly into the training loss. This enables efficient, likelihood-free inference of full posterior distributions for key thermodynamic quantities-including pressure, squared speed of sound, and the trace anomaly-conditioned on observational data. Our models are trained on synthetic datasets generated from two agnostic EoS priors: polytropic parametrizations (PT) and gaussian process (GP) reconstructions. These datasets span various scenarios, including the presence or absence of tidal deformability information and observational noise. Across all settings, the method produces accurate and well-calibrated posteriors, with uncertainties reduced when tidal deformability constraints are included. Furthermore, we find that the behavior of normalized predictive dispersions is strongly correlated with the maximum central density inside NSs, suggesting that the model can indirectly infer this physically meaningful quantity. The approach generalizes well across EoS families and accurately reconstructs derivative quantities such as the polytropic index, demonstrating its robustness and potential for probing dense matter in NS cores.",

        "abstract": "Studies of the cosmic dark ages ($30 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 150$) using the highly redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen offer unparalleled amounts of cosmological information, and recent years have seen the refinement of concepts for such experiments (e.g. CoDEX and FarView), nominally feasible with technology and resources in the next one to two decades. This work studies how the \"foreground wedge\" -- a term in the 21 cm cosmology literature referring to the contamination of power spectrum modes through the combination of smooth-spectrum foreground emission and the frequency-dependent point spread function of a radio interferometer -- manifests at these very high redshifts. We find the effect is more significant than at Epoch of Reionization redshifts targeted by current ground-based experiments, with foreground avoidance techniques (which discard all $k$ modes falling within the wedge) typically losing an order of magnitude of sensitivity. Given the extreme faintness of the 21 cm signal from the cosmic dark ages and the very high sky temperatures (the dominant source of noise) at low radio frequencies, we conclude that some level of foreground subtraction will be necessary to enable dark ages 21 cm cosmology with experiments of the scale believed to be achievable in the near term.",

Some have suggested this tension is alleviated if matter is converted to dark radiation via dark matter decay. As it is not clear that dark matter decays, we instead examine the effects of converting matter to gravitational radiation via black hole mergers. We consider mergers of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), mergers of stellar-mass black holes, and the formation of SMBHs from mergers of smaller black holes. We find that these processes cannot alleviate the tension, as an unrealistically large merger rate, or an overproduction of SMBHs is required. We also consider whether one can use the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect to constrain mechanisms that form SMBHs from mergers of smaller black holes. We find that this is also too small to be viable.",

In this Letter, we formulate a general dynamical framework for a radio-emitting shell driven by disk winds and expanding through a power-law ambient medium under the influence of SMBH gravity. We derive and classify power-law-in-time solutions to the governing equations in the adiabatic regime. In particular, a universal $t^{2/3}$ scaling emerges naturally when gravitational energy dominates or is comparable to thermal energy, irrespective of the ambient density profile, whereas the classical Sedov-Taylor solution is recovered when gravity is negligible. Our analysis reveals that, in regimes where SMBH gravity governs the shell expansion, the SMBH mass can be inferred from radio observations of the shell. This approach is independent of and complementary to conventional mass estimators, with direct implications for interpreting radio-emitting TDEs and probing SMBH demographics. Our formalism further predicts that 10-100 GHz monitoring with existing and planned facilities can yield SMBH masses within months of disruption, providing a time-domain analogue to reverberation mapping.",

The XL-Calibur observations allowed us to derive the most precise constraints to date of the Polarization Degree (PD) and Polarization Angle (PA) of the hard X-ray emission from a BHXRB. XL-Calibur observed Cyg X-1 in the hard state and measured a $\\sim$19-64 keV PD of ($5.0^{+2.7}_{-3.0}$)% at a PA of $-28^{\\circ}\\pm 17^{\\circ}$, with an 8.7% chance probability of detecting larger PDs than the one observed, given an unpolarized signal. The XL-Calibur results are thus comparable to the 2-8 keV PD and PA found by IXPE, with a similar agreement between the hard X-ray PA and the radio jet direction.

These events show additional components in the pulse profile which are produced by signal that is deflected by ionized nebular material and are therefore delayed relative to the primary emission. We observed the Crab pulsar with \\ac{CHIME} during its daily transits, creating an archive of baseband recordings of bright single pulses (known as giant pulses) in the 400$-800\\,\\unit{MHz}$ band. From these, we produced daily stacks of aligned pulses between late October 2021 and March 2024. We find that in these averages, echoes are readily visible throughout the observation period, and we identify clear groups of echoes with distinct behaviour in terms of their evolution with time and frequency. Many echoes exhibit dispersive delays consistent with being observed through excess column densities relative to the unscattered rays, but we also find two events where the dispersive delays indicate column density deficits. For the first time, we also find echoes for which the line of sight never directly intersects the intervening structures, resulting in events with non-zero minimum delays, of around ${0.5 \\rm\\,ms}$. The frequency and diversity of the observed echoes make the Crab an excellent target for long-term studies of astrophysical plasma lensing.",

Using the Bernoulli equation and critical point analysis, we derive flow solutions along various magnetic field lines. Our hybrid jet model shows that discontinuities in field-line angular velocity lead to clear velocity shear and density jumps at the interface between the two jet components.

This provides a striking contrast with the well-known Lyth bound, which yields a lower bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio in such models. The two bounds thus play complementary roles in assessing the viability of inflationary scenarios. We demonstrate that, for certain representative large-field inflation models, the Swampland Distance Conjecture alone can impose more stringent upper limits on the tensor-toscalar ratio than current observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background.

This time the 2015-2023 SAP has been fainter and two years past its conclusion no new eruption has yet taken place. During 2005-2025, a period covering SAP and the preceding quiescence, we collected a massive amount of photometric and spectroscopic observations that we have analyzed together with Swift UVOT data. Guided by the results of the orbital solution and in particular by the radiative modeling to which we subjected the whole set of available data, we found for T CrB a binary period of 227.5528 days, an inclination of 61 deg, and masses of 1.35 Msun and 0.93 Msun for the white dwarf and the M3III companion, respectively, making mass transfer dynamically stable. The red giant fills completely its Roche lobe, and at Vrot sin(i)=4.75 +-0.26 km/s it is rotating much slower that the 16 km/s co-rotation value. The ~20 deg azimuth of the hot spot, implied by the hump shaping the optical light curve in quiescence, fixes the outer radius of the disk to 58 Rsun, the same as the canonical value expected from disk theory. In quiescence the disk is cold and mostly neutral. SAP has been caused by an inside-out collapse of the disk, during which the mean accretion rate onto the WD has been ~28x larger than in quiescence. SAP ended in April 2023, but from May 2024 mass-flow has intensively resumed at disk inner radii while the collapse wave reached the outer portions of the disk; the consequent revamp in mass accretion could fill the gap inherited by the fainter 2015-2023 SAP and eventually lead the WD accreted shell to ignition.",

Recent analyses have found conflicting evidence for a sub-population of black holes with negligible spin, but the Default spin magnitude population model used in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analyses cannot formally accommodate an excess of systems with zero spin. In this work, we analyze several different simulated BBH populations to demonstrate that even in the face of this mismodeling, spinning and nonspinning populations can be reliably distinguished using the Default spin magnitude population model coupled with spin sorting. While typical analyses sort the binary components by their masses, sorting the components by their spin magnitudes instead offers a complementary view of the properties of individual systems consistent with equal mass and of population-level properties, given binary evolution processes like tidal-spin up that predict asymmetric spin magnitudes among the binary components. We conclude that current observations of the BBH population are inconsistent with a fully nonspinning population, but could be explained by a population with only one spinning black hole per binary or a population with up to 80% nonspinning sources.",

This is true, in particular, for stellar-mass black hole sources observed in the thermally-dominated state, for which the polarization signal is expected to depend on the accretion disk inclination and the black hole spin. Two main effects determine the polarization properties of the accretion disk emission: the absorption and scattering processes occurring before the radiation leaves the disk atmosphere, and the relativistic effects influencing its propagation towards the observer at infinity. In this work, we investigate these effects together considering only the contribution of direct radiation. We analyze how the ionization state of the disk atmosphere, approximated with a constant-density surface layer assumed to be either in collisional ionization equilibrium or photoionization equilibrium, can influence the spectro-polarimetric properties of the radiation at the emitting disk surface. Subsequently we study how these are modified by the propagation in a strong gravitational field.",

        "abstract": "X-ray thermal emission is inherent in neutron-star and black-hole X-ray binary systems. Within these systems, it may reflect from optically thick matter, which will create characteristic observable X-ray spectro-polarimetric features. We compute rest-frame reflection spectra and the corresponding energy-dependent linear polarization degree and angle for (un)polarized single-temperature black-body spectra impinging on a partially ionized constant-density optically thick slab. We use a combination of a Monte Carlo simulation that takes into account scattering, absorption, and spectral lines, with a non-LTE radiative transfer pre-computation of the ionization structure of the slab in photo-ionization equilibrium. We discuss the impact of the reflector's ionization and of the incident spectral shape on the obtained energy dependence of polarization. Despite the presence of highly polarized absorption features and low-polarized spectral lines, an underlying scattering-induced increase of polarization degree with energy in mid to hard X-rays naturally arises due to multiple Compton-scattering energy shifts. Such re-processing effect is particularly apparent in 2-8 keV for steep incident X-ray spectra reflecting from highly-ionized optically thick media. Integration of the resulting local reflection tables in specific large-scale reflection geometries occurring in X-ray binary systems, including relativistic effects, will be presented in a follow-up paper. Nonetheless, we anticipate that the obtained local energy-dependent features will imprint at large distances from the source to the observed X-ray polarization, and could contribute to the observed increase of total polarization degree with energy in 2-8 keV in many accreting systems by the IXPE mission.",

        "abstract": "In addition to curvature singularities, electrovacuum black holes in general relativity exhibit thermodynamic singularities. These so-called Davies' points occur at non-extremal values of charge and spin where the heat capacity diverges and may indicate a type of theoretical incompleteness. The thermodynamic regularity of several families of static, asymptotically-flat spacetimes with bounded curvature invariants is examined using a theory-agnostic framework, showing that while they may be regular in physical space they are generally not in phase space. The inclusion of angular momentum, via the Newman-Janis algorithm, makes the set of such \"doubly regular\" objects especially restrictive. It is argued that, if thermodynamic regularity is to be considered a desirable property for an astrophysical black hole, these considerations could be used to narrow down the viable pool of regular extensions to the Kerr-Newman metric.",

        "abstract": "We present an analysis of new multi-wavelength observations of the TeV gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057, conducted using SALT, Swift, NuSTAR, and VERITAS in 2023--2024. By combining these new data with archival observations, we confirm previous suggestions of orbital variability in the source's X-ray spectrum, including increased X-ray absorption at the orbital phase interval of $\\phi\\approx0.3\\textrm{--}0.4$. The source's X-ray flux within this phase interval seems to have exhibited a significant change on an orbital timescale. Additionally, occasional short-term variations in the X-ray band on a timescale of less than 3 days have been observed. The measured duration of the increased absorbing column density and the flux variability timescales can provide clues about the interaction between the putative pulsar and the Be companion's disk if, as previously suggested, the pulsar crosses the disk at this phase interval. Moreover, the new contemporaneous X-ray and TeV observations around the pulsar-crossing phases revealed independent variability in the X-ray and TeV fluxes, contrary to a previous observation of concurrent flux increases. While these observations alone cannot provide definitive conclusions, we discuss our results in the context of pulsar-disk interaction and intrabinary shock emission scenarios.",

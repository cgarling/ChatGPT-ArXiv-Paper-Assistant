We detect new diffuse structures, including a prominent emission in the northwest coincident with the HI distribution, and a faint spiral arm-like feature in the southeast. We also identify a very faint dwarf galaxy, TTT-d1 ($\\mu_{0,g} \\sim 26$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$), about 130 kpc southeast of Malin 2, possibly its first known satellite ultra-diffuse galaxy. A multi-directional wedge photometric analysis of Malin 2 shows strong azimuthal variations in its stellar disk. Compared with nearby spirals and other GLSBs, Malin 2 lies at the extreme end in radial extent and stellar mass surface density. The overlap between the asymmetric stellar emission and a lopsided HI distribution suggests contributions from tidal interactions in the formation of the giant disk of Malin 2. Our results highlight the importance of ultra-deep, wide-field imaging in understanding the structural complexity of giant LSB galaxies. Upcoming surveys such as LSST will be crucial to determine whether the features we observe in Malin 2 are common to other giant LSB disk galaxies.",

However, numerical convergence of subhalo evolution is difficult to achieve, especially in the inner regions of host halos where tidal forces are strongest. I investigate the numerical convergence and correction methods for the abundance, spatial, and velocity distributions of subhalos using two $6144^3$-particle cosmological N-body simulations with different mass resolutions -- Jiutian-300 ($1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$) and Jiutian-1G ($3.7 \\times 10^{8}\\,h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$) -- with subhalos identified by HBT+. My study shows that the Surviving subhalo Peak Mass Function (SPMF) converges only for subhalos with $m_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ above $5000$ particles but can be accurately recovered by including orphan subhalos that survive according to the merger timescale model of Jiang et al., which outperforms other models. Including orphan subhalos also enables recovery of the real-space spatial and velocity distributions to $5$--$10\\%$ accuracy down to scales of $0.1$--$0.2\\,h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$. The remaining differences are likely due to cosmic variance and finite-box effects in the smaller Jiutian-300 simulation. Convergence below $0.1\\,h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ remains challenging and requires more sophisticated modeling of orphan subhalos. I further highlight that redshift-space multipoles are more difficult to recover even at larger scales because unreliable small-scale pairs at $r_{\\mathrm{p}} < 0.1\\,h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ in real space affect scales of tens of $\\mathrm{Mpc}$ in redshift space due to elongated Fingers-of-God effects.

A change in the metal abundance is shown to substantially affect the period-luminosity relation because of significant growth of the slope with decreasing $Z$. In particular, Mira variables of the LMC ($Z=0.006$) are brighter by 0.2-0.5 mag than galactic Mira variables ($Z=0.02$) with same pulsation periods.

        "abstract": "Accurately accounting for mixed-gas opacities is critical for radiative-transfer (RT) calculations in sub-stellar atmospheres. To produce the total k-coefficients of an arbitrary mixture of gases and their associated volume mixing ratios (VMRs), several methods are applied in the literature with various levels of overall accuracy and ease of computation. We propose a simple, tunable random overlap method, polynomial reconstruction and sampling (PRAS). PRAS is a Monte Carlo-based technique, sampling polynomial approximations of the opacity cumulative distribution function (CDF) in a wavelength band for each species requiring mixing. The method enables control over the end accuracy of the opacity mixture through choices in CDF fitting and number of random samples used in the mixing scheme. We find PRAS is typically as accurate, or more accurate, than other methods at recovering individual, pre-mixed k-coefficients. In an emission spectrum comparison test, PRAS, even with a small number of samples (100), is within ~2% of the reference 16+16 Legendre quadrature node random overlap with resorting and rebinning (RORR) results, and is typically more accurate than the 4+4 and 8+8 Legendre node schemes. In the vertical flux and heating rate tests, we also find that PRAS is generally more accurate than other schemes, and an improvement over the adaptive equivalent extinction (AEE) method. Overall, our current tests show PRAS is a generally viable alternative for the calculation of randomly overlapped opacities, especially in scenarios where increased accuracy of the RT calculation is required and when larger numbers of quadrature points are used. PRAS may therefore provide a benefit in performance and accuracy for high-precision retrieval modelling of JWST data.",

Scaling relations are a powerful tool for measuring fundamental stellar parameters, and the derived radii are in good agreement with fundamental data for low-luminosity giants. However, for luminous red giant branch (RGB) stars, there are clear systematic offsets. In APOKASC-3, the third joint spectroscopic and asteroseismic catalog for evolved stars in the Kepler fields, we tied asteroseismic radii to a reference system based on Gaia astrometry by introducing correction factors. This work proposes an alternative formulation of the correction scheme, which substantially reduces the sensitivity of the results to the technique used to infer mean density from frequency spacings. Compared to APOKASC-3, our adjusted correction scheme also reduces fractional discrepancies in median masses and ages of lower RGB and upper RGB within the $\\alpha$-rich population from $6.65\\%$ to $1.72\\%$ and from $-21.81\\%$ to $-9.55\\%$, respectively.

Compared to cluster galaxies without elevated gas asymmetries, cluster galaxies with elevated gas asymmetries have, on average, more centrally concentrated star-formation. Finally, we find the highest fraction of galaxies with elevated gas asymmetries in clusters likely to host significant substructure or be dynamically complex. Our findings are consistent with the scenario of galaxies falling into clusters, either individually or in groups, and undergoing disk-fading and a redistribution of gas, due to ram pressure stripping experienced during pericentre passage.",

MAMBO-9 is among the most massive, gas-rich, and actively star-forming galaxies at this epoch, when the Universe was less than 1 Gyr old. The new, 400 pc-resolution [CII] observations reveal velocity gradients in both objects; we estimate dynamical masses and find a relative mass ratio of 1:5. The kinematics of both objects suggest both rotation and strong tidal interaction, suggesting that the pair has already experienced a close encounter. Indeed, the new JWST imaging reveals a continuous bridge of moderately dust-obscured material between the two. We perform spatially-resolved SED fitting using the high-resolution ALMA+JWST imaging, finding that the majority of recent star-formation is concentrated in extremely obscured ($A_V > 10$) clouds, while the majority of rest-optical light (stellar continuum and H$\\alpha$ emission) is emergent from moderate-to-highly obscured ($A_V\\sim 1$-$5$) regions on the outskirts. Combining our new stellar and dynamical mass measurements with previous CO observations, we find that the mass budget of MAMBO-9 requires a CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\\alpha_{\\rm CO}$) of roughly unity, indicative of a highly metal-enriched ISM. Finally, we show that MAMBO-9 resides in a large overdensity spanning the PRIMER-COSMOS field, with 39 galaxies spectroscopically confirmed within $\\sim 25$ cMpc. With a total baryonic mass $\\sim 10^{11}\\,M_\\odot$, MAMBO-9 can be considered a prototype of massive galaxy formation and likely progenitor of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the lower-redshift Universe.",

The outflowing nebulae are preferentially aligned with the radio jet axis, suggesting jet-driven origin.

However, only $\\lesssim 1$\\% of the jet mechanical energy couples to the warm ionized gas via outflows, consistent with predictions from hydrodynamic simulations. A large fraction of the jet energy may instead reside in shock-heated hot gas, supported by X-ray detection, or used to thermalize the gas and produce the observed emission-line nebulae. Our results demonstrate that radio jets in massive, gas-rich systems at high-redshift can inject significant kinetic and thermal energy to the surroundings, providing direct evidence for jet-driven feedback operating during the peak epoch of galaxy formation.",

Although their Lyman continuum escape fractions ($f_{\\mathrm{esc}} \\sim 0.1$) are comparable to those of LAEs, individual protocluster galaxies are faint ($M_{\\mathrm{UV}} > -19$) and low-mass ($\\log(M_*/M_\\odot) \\sim 8.5$). The enhanced number density within protoclusters boosts the local UV luminosity density by nearly 1 dex. The surrounding gas remains largely neutral, suggesting that reionization was highly patchy and modulated by environment. The protocluster galaxies likely host ionization-bounded nebulae with holes, suppressing Ly$\\alpha$ visibility, in contrast to field galaxies that are more consistent with density-bounded nebulae.",

The analyses are performed on both macro- and micro-filaments, each characterized by their length, thickness, and contrast in mass density. In addition to total sample comparisons, two subcategories of micro-filaments, GG (linking galaxy groups) and CC (linking galaxy clusters), are introduced to further analyze discrepancies between the $\\Lambda$CDM model and observation. While $\\Lambda$CDM produces extended macro-filaments, such structures are largely absent in SDSS, and where present, they exhibit higher densities than their simulated counterparts. Micro-filaments also show notable density discrepancies: at fixed length and thickness, observational filaments are significantly denser than those in the simulation. Employing radial density profiles reveal that micro-filaments in the $\\Lambda$CDM simulation exhibit higher contrasts in mass density relative to the background compared to their observational counterparts. Notably, CC type micro-filaments displayed enhanced density contrasts over GG types in the simulation, while observational data showed the opposite trend. Furthermore, SDSS galaxies in both GG and CC micro-filaments exhibit lower specific star formation rates (sSFR) and older stellar populations, while TNG300-1 micro-filaments host more actively star-forming galaxies within the intermediate stellar mass range. These results reveal persistent discrepancies between observational data and the $\\Lambda$CDM reconstruction of cosmic filaments, pointing to possible tensions in our current understanding of large-scale structures and their environmental effects on galaxy evolution.",

Multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy were obtained by cross-matching sources with SDSS, GALEX, and WISE datasets. Our main results suggest that up to 45% of optically red spirals are dusty compared to blue spiral galaxies based on infrared observations. The presence of dust can obscure star formation and hence lead to red spirals being misclassified as passive systems. Approximately half of the red spirals do not show evidence of a large abundance of dust, hence are optically red due to passive evolution. Support for the passive nature of these red spirals is provided by SDSS emission line data based on the Dn(4000) spectral index, EW(H-alpha), EW(H-delta), and [O III] 5007 A luminosity, and on a comparison of the star formation rate and the specific star formation rate with cluster blue spirals.

Their low temperature provides them with complex atmospheres characterised by the presence of strong molecular absorption bands which, together with their faintness, have made their accurate characterisation a great challenge for astronomers over the last decades. M dwarfs account for 75% of the census of stars within 10 pc of the Sun, and their suitability as targets in the search for Earth-like planets has led many research groups to focus on the study of these objects, which is crucial for the understanding of the structure and kinematics of our Galaxy. Very low-mass stars and substellar objects with spectral types M7 or later, including the extended L, T, and Y spectral types, constitute the domain of ultracool dwarfs. The study of these objects, discovered definitively in 1995, is key for understanding the boundary between stellar and substellar objects and promises to experience a quantum leap thanks to the characteristics of new-generation surveys such as Euclid or LSST.   Data analysis in the field of observational astronomy has undergone a paradigm shift during the last decades driven by an exponential growth in the volume and complexity of available data. In this revolution, the Virtual Observatory has become a cornerstone providing a system that fosters interoperability between astronomical archives around the world. In response to this growth in data complexity, the astronomical community has increasingly adopted machine learning techniques for the development of scalable, automated solutions.   This thesis explores the discovery and characterisation of M dwarfs and ultracool dwarfs, using data-driven approaches supported by Virtual Observatory technologies and protocols.

We focus on the upcoming low-mode survey of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-Low) telescope. Using CNNs, we analyze simulated 3D 21-cm differential brightness temperature maps generated via the DM21cm code, which is based on 21cmFAST and DarkHistory, to distinguish between spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous energy injection/deposition scenarios arising from dark matter annihilation. The inhomogeneous case accounts for local dark matter density contrasts and gas properties, such as thermal and ionization states, while the homogeneous model assumes uniform energy deposition. Our study focuses on two primary annihilation channels to electron-positron pairs ($e^+e^-$) and photons ( $\\gamma \\gamma$), exploring dark matter masses from 1 MeV to 100 MeV and a range of annihilation cross-sections. For $\\gamma \\gamma$ channel, the distinction across dark matter models is less pronounced due to the larger mean free path of the emitted photons, resulting in a more uniform energy deposition. For $e^+e^-$ channel, the results indicate that the CNNs can effectively differentiate between the inhomogeneous and homogeneous cases. Despite observational challenges, the results demonstrate that these effects remain detectable even after incorporating noise from next-generation radio interferometers, such as the SKA. We find that the inhomogeneous dark matter annihilation models can leave measurable imprints on the 21-cm signal maps distinguishable from the homogeneous scenarios for the dark matter masses $m_{\\rm DM}=1$ MeV and the annihilation cross-sections of $\\geq 5 \\times 10^{-30}~{\\rm cm^3/sec}$ ($\\geq 5 \\times 10^{-29}~{\\rm cm^3/sec}$ for $m_{\\rm DM}=100$ MeV) for moderate SKA-Low noise.",

The signatures of modified gravity in the bispectrum are even more pronounced in redshift space, where anisotropies from peculiar velocities provide unbiased information on higher-order properties of gravity. We investigate the potential of all non-zero angular multipoles $B_l^m$ of redshift space bispectrum across all possible triangle configurations to probe degenerate higher-order scalar tensor (DHOST) theory. We show that the higher-order multipoles of the bispectrum with $l=2,4,6$ are more sensitive to the modifications in gravity than the spherically averaged monopole moment $l=0$. These multipoles demonstrate remarkable sensitivity to the higher-order growth history, which varies across triangle configurations, with acute triangles generally being the most sensitive to modification in GR. The values of various multipoles exhibit opposite signs in modified gravity compared to those predicted in GR, which serves as a robust indicator of the deviation from GR. We demonstrate that, unlike $l=2$ and $4$ multipoles, the $l=6$ multipoles with $m\\leq 4$ are not affected by the quadratic bias and second-order tidal bias parameters, emphasising the need to leverage their capabilities in analyses. The $(l=6, m > 4)$ multipoles fail to capture the second-order growth, while all $l=8$ multipoles lack any independent information regarding modified gravity in both linear and nonlinear regimes.",

We present here a broad assessment of transient lensing search opportunities, spanning more than twenty decades in photon frequency and over twelve orders of magnitude in PBH mass.

Our survey includes low-frequency radio events (FRBs, pulsar giant pulses, planetary cyclotron bursts), optical/infrared signals, and high-energy phenomena (gamma-ray burst spikes, fast X-ray transients, TeV blazar flares). We synthesize these results in a unified mass-abundance diagram and comprehensive tables summarizing both physical reach and observational requirements.

        "abstract": "Systematic effects that limit the achievable sensitivity of current low-frequency radio telescopes to the 21-cm signal are among the foremost challenges in observational 21-cm cosmology. The standard approach to retrieving the 21-cm signal from radio interferometric data separates it from bright astrophysical foregrounds by exploiting their spectrally smooth nature, in contrast to the finer spectral structure of the 21-cm signal. Contaminants exhibiting rapid frequency fluctuations, on the other hand, are difficult to separate from the 21-cm signal using standard techniques, and the power from these contaminants contributes to low-level systematics that can limit our ability to detect the 21-cm signal. Many of these low-level systematics are incoherent across multiple nights of observation, resulting in an incoherent excess variance above the thermal noise sensitivity of the instrument. In this paper, we develop a method called cross-GPR (cross covariance Gaussian process regression) that exploits the incoherence of these systematics to separate them from the 21-cm signal, which remains coherent across multiple nights of observation. We first develop and demonstrate the technique on synthetic signals in a general setting, and then apply it to gridded interferometric visibility cubes. We perform realistic simulations of visibility cubes containing foregrounds, 21-cm signal, noise, and incoherent systematics. The simulations show that the method can successfully separate and subtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, and its advantages over standard techniques become more evident when the spectral behavior of the contaminants resembles that of the 21-cm signal. Simulations performed on a variety of 21-cm signal shapes also reveal that the cross-GPR approach can subtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, without suppressing the 21-cm signal.",

        "abstract": "We report the finding of a linear, non-axisymmetric, global instability in gas discs around stars, which may be relevant to other astrophysical discs. It takes the form of an $m=1$ mode that grows in the disc density distribution while the star-barycentre distance rises exponentially with a characteristic timescale that is orders of magnitude longer than the orbital period. We present results of hydrodynamical simulations with various codes and numerical methods, using either barycentric or stellocentric reference frames, with or without the disc's self gravity: all simulations consistently show an unstable mode growing exponentially.   The instability disappears if, and only if, the reflex motion of the star due to the disc's asymmetry is not taken into account in the simulations. For this reason we refer to this instability as the reflex instability. We identify a feedback loop as a possible origin, whereby the acceleration of the star excites the eccentricity of the disc, yielding an $m=1$ mode in the density distribution which, in turn, pulls the star. The growth timescale of the instability decreases with increasing disc mass and is a few hundred orbits for disc-to-star mass ratios of a few percent. If truly physical, and not due to a numerical artifact that would be common to all the codes we have employed, the reflex instability could have a dramatic impact on protoplanetary discs evolution and planetary formation.",

We dynamically decompose clusters into orbiting and infalling material and fit their density profiles.

Both components follow a consistent $r_{\\mathrm{t}}{-}\\Gamma$ relation, where $\\Gamma$ is the mass accretion rate, which suggests that stellar profiles can be used to infer recent cluster mass growth. We also find that the normalisation of the density profile of infalling material correlates with $\\Gamma$, and that stellar and dark matter scale radii coincide when measured non-parametrically. By fitting stellar profiles in projection, we show that $r_{\\mathrm{t}}$ can, in principle, be recovered observationally, with a typical scatter of $\\sim 0.3\\,R_{200\\mathrm{m}}$. Our results demonstrate that the splashback feature in the stellar component provides a viable proxy for the cluster's physical boundary and recent growth by mass accretion, offering a complementary observable tracer to satellite galaxies and weak lensing.",

        "abstract": "Context. Solar flux atlases observe the spatially integrated light from the Sun, treating it as a star. They are fundamental tools for gaining insight into the composition of the Sun and other stars, and are utilized as reference material for a wide range of solar applications such as stellar chemical abundances, atmospheric physics, stellar activity, and radial velocity signals. Aims. We provide a detailed comparison of solar activity in some of the well-known solar atlases against the new High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) Quiet Sun (QS) and measured activity (MA) atlases that are published, for the first time, in this work. Methods. Ten of the widely used individual spectral lines from each flux atlas were selected to compare solar activity using three methods: 1) Equivalent Widths 2) Activity number, a novel activity measure which we introduce in this work. 3) Bisectors and radial velocity. Results. The significantly smaller activity measured in the MA atlas compared to the other atlases, relative to the QS atlas, underscores the dominance of instrumental effects over solar activity in their impact on spectral lines, which cannot be corrected through simple line convolution to match resolutions of other atlases. Additionally, our investigation unexpectedly revealed a substantial intensity shift in the Ca ii H & K lines of other atlases compared to our HARPS-N atlases, likely caused by assumptions in normalisation techniques used in the early Kitt Peak atlases. Conclusions. With an average spot number of zero, our QS atlas is well suited to serve as an absolute benchmark atlas representative of solar minimum for the visible spectrum that other atlases can be compared against. Our recommendations are 1) publication of a detailed log along with the observations, to include exact dates and indications of solar activity...",

        "abstract": "We construct and investigate the dynamical black hole spacetime embedded in the expanding universe filled with cosmic fluid, such as dark energy. When the equation of state (EoS) parameter of the fluid is a constant, we find exact solutions of the Einstein equation where the Schwarzschild black hole is embedded in the expanding universe. This solution differs from the well-known McVittie metric, where the EoS parameter is not a constant but rather depends on the radial coordinate. It is shown that a dynamical black hole grows with the expansion of the universe. If primordial black holes are created before or during inflation, above dynamical black holes might be the origin of the supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies, massive black holes suggested by the GW231123 event, and also the dark matter. The case where the cosmic fluid EoS is more general is also considered so that the universe enters the epoch of finite-time future singularity. Thermodynamics and the behaviour of black holes around different future singularities are carefully investigated. It is then demonstrated that the black hole horizon enhances the tidal force, but near the horizon, the tidal force works to press the extended object, which is in contrast with a massive body near to future singularity.   We also propose a new type of future singularity where the singularity inside the black hole is a sphere with a finite radius. When the radius of the spherical singularity becomes larger than the radius of the black hole horizon, it becomes naked. The universe may end up with a cosmic doomsday when the radius of the singularity becomes infinite.",

These observations were made in the 1.3 mm dust continuum and molecular lines at angular resolutions of $\\sim 0.05''$ ($\\sim 8$ au) and $\\sim 0.16''$ ($\\sim25$ au), respectively. The continuum emission shows a disk-like structure with a radius of $\\sim22$ au.

The dusty disk is found to exhibit a brightness asymmetry along its minor axis in the continuum emission, probably caused by a flared distribution of the dust and the high optical depth of the dust emission. In addition, the CO(2-1) and SiO(5-4) emissions show knotty and wiggling motions in the jets.

In this paper, we present a multi-epoch search and detailed timing analysis of millisecond pulsars in the GC M2, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope. We have discovered two new binary millisecond pulsars in M2, designated M2F and M2G, respectively. We provide measurements of the emission properties of all known pulsars in M2, including their polarization profiles, rotation measures, flux densities, scintillation characteristics, and so forth. In particular, we report the first rotation measure at the distance and direction of this cluster. Additionally, we report the first phase-coherent timing solutions for the M2 pulsars. From our Bayesian timing analysis, we have measured their spin and orbital parameters with high precision, including the advance of periastron for M2A and M2E indicating total system masses of 1.75(13) and 1.80(5) solar masses respectively. Using archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope, we have identified an optical counterpart of M2C, which is likely the white dwarf companion of the pulsar. By combining results from optical and radio observations, we have reconstructed the binary evolution track of this system and estimated the cooling age of the companion to be approximately 10\\,Myr, making it the youngest white dwarf in any known GC binary pulsars. Furthermore, using the spin period derivatives of M2 pulsars, we have investigated the gravitational potential of the cluster and found that our results strongly support the latest central-stellar-velocity dispersion measurement in M2.",

First, we examine the impact of neutrino mass on cosmological parameter estimation from both the power spectrum and bispectrum in real space. We create 1-loop power spectrum and bispectrum templates in real-space and fit to the \\texttt{Quijote} simulation suite, including the cross-covariance between the power spectrum and the bispectrum. We show the neutrino signature kernels estimate the same cosmological parameters as the model with the SPT (Standard Perturbation Theory) kernels, even for DESI Year 5 volume, except for the galaxy bias parameters inferred from the bispectrum. Second, we investigate to what extent the bispectrum can improve parameter constraints. We perform a Fisher forecast using the power spectrum, the tree-level bispectrum, and a joint analysis that includes the cross-covariance between them. We show that including the bispectrum can substantially reduce the error bars on key parameters. For the neutrino mass in particular, the uncertainty is reduced by $\\sim 20\\%$",

        "abstract": "Solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance plays a crucial role in heating the Earth's ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere, affecting atmospheric dynamics over varying time scales. Although significant effort has been spent studying short-term EUV variations from solar transient events, there is little work to explore the long-term evolution of the EUV flux over multiple solar cycles. Continuous EUV flux measurements have only been available since 1995, leaving significant gaps in earlier data. In this study, we propose a Bayesian deep learning model, named SEMNet, to fill the gaps. We validate our approach by applying SEMNet to construct SOHO/SEM EUV flux measurements in the period between 1998 and 2014 using CaII K images from the Precision Solar Photometric Telescope. We then extend SEMNet through transfer learning to reconstruct solar EUV irradiance in the period between 1950 and 1960 using CaII K images from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory. Experimental results show that SEMNet provides reliable predictions along with uncertainty bounds, demonstrating the feasibility of CaII K images as a robust proxy for long-term EUV fluxes.

        "abstract": "We present a comprehensive assessment of multiparameter tests of general relativity (GR) in the inspiral regime of compact binary coalescences using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our analysis is based on an extensive set of simulated gravitational wave signals, including both general relativistic and non-GR sources, injected into zero-noise data colored by the noise power spectral densities of the LIGO and Virgo detectors at their designed sensitivities. We evaluate the performance of PCA-based methods in the context of two established frameworks: TIGER and FTI. For GR-consistent signals, we find that PCA enables stringent constraints on potential deviations from GR, even in the presence of multiple free parameters. Applying the method to simulated signals that explicitly violate GR, we demonstrate that PCA is effective at identifying such deviations. We further test the method using numerical relativity waveforms of eccentric binary black hole systems and show that missing physical effects-such as orbital eccentricity-can lead to apparent violations of GR if not properly included in the waveform models used for analysis. Finally, we apply our PCA-based test to selected real gravitational-wave events from GWTC-3, including GW190814 and GW190412. We present joint constraints from selected binary black hole events in GWTC-3, finding that the 90% credible bound on the most informative PCA parameter is $0.03^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ in the TIGER framework and $-0.01^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ in the FTI framework, both of which are consistent with GR. These results highlight the sensitivity and robustness of the PCA-based approach and demonstrate its readiness for application to future observational data from the fourth observing runs of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA.",

The presence of PV terms induces velocity birefringence in the tensor perturbations. During inflation, when the inflaton rapidly traverses the cliff-like region in its potential, the tensor modes at specific scales for one of the two circular polarization states undergo significant amplification due to tachyonic instability. Consequently, the resulting primordial gravitational waves (GWs), characterized by a one-handed polarization and a multi-peak structure in their energy spectrum, exhibit a significant amplitude potentially detectable by LISA and Taiji, and their chirality could be determined by the LISA-Taiji network. The detection of such a chiral GW signal provides an opportunity to probe inflation and PV gravity theory.",

        "abstract": "Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are binary systems where a compact object slowly inspirals into its much larger compact partner. Since we anticipate such systems to exist within and be dynamically influenced by the galactic center environment, we expect them to be instrumental in studying these environments and testing our theories of gravity in the strong field regime. The gravitational waves associated with the EMRI motion fall within the mHz regime, making them target sources for future space-based detectors. However, because of the crowded nature of these galactic centers, these EMRIs could be perturbed by other nearby orbiting bodies. In this work, we analyze potential perturbations in EMRIs due to a third-body perturber near resonance. We use the formalism and code tools developed in the previous paper in this series [Silva \\& Hirata, {\\slshape Phys. Rev. D} {\\bfseries 106}:084508 (2022)] and expand them to account for a general outer body orbit, allowing for multiple resonant interactions within an orbit and across a variety of SMBH spins. We find that, after investigating nearly 142,000 resonant interactions across a restricted set of 180 different simulated orbit systems, none cause changes to the EMRI dynamics beyond a perturbative correction, but could lead to potentially large changes in the phase of the waveform of order 0.1 radian. Detectable phase changes in the waveform induced by third-body perturbers could be a common occurrence and will require careful consideration for developing accurate EMRI waveform models. This analysis suggests that our formalism and pipeline are robust enough to handle a wide variety of resonances from various perturbing orbit configurations around the EMRI, which will aid in developing more accurate waveform models to better probe galactic center environments and test theories of gravity using gravitational wave observations of EMRIs.",

        "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic radio transients of unknown origin, and studying their host galaxies could offer clues to constrain progenitor models. Among various host properties, gas-phase metallicity is a key factor influencing stellar evolution and the production of transients. We analyze the largest uniformly selected sample of FRB host galaxies to date, measuring oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H) = 8.04-8.84) for 40 hosts using consistent emission-line diagnostics. Using a volume-limited subsample, we compare the distributions of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity to a control sample of star-forming galaxies matched in the same selection criteria. We find that FRB host galaxies span a wide range in metallicity and are broadly consistent with the SFR-weighted mass-metallicity relation of the star-forming galaxy population. Contrary to the earlier claim in the literature, we find no clear lower bound on metallicity, suggesting that metallicity alone does not strictly regulate FRB production. Encouragingly, this implies FRBs can form even in low-metallicity, high-redshift galaxies, supporting their potential as probes of matter distribution across cosmic time. Additionally, we find marginal ($\\sim$2$\\sigma$) evidence for a -0.09 $\\pm$ 0.04 dex metallicity offset from the fundamental metallicity relation, likely due to suppressed SFRs at fixed mass and metallicity rather than metal deficiency. This offset resembles that observed in local post-merger galaxies, and may reflect a post-starburst phase following galaxy interactions, where FRB progenitors formed during the starburst produce FRBs after a 100-500 Myr delay, consistent with observed delay-time distributions and favoring binary evolution channels over core-collapse supernovae.",

Using thermo-chemical modeling, we explore how the temperature and chemistry within a protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star is impacted by the surrounding UV environment. The disk becomes hotter due to heating by photodissociation of molecules, photoelectric heating, H_2, and atomic processes and as a result the area in which molecules exist in the ice-phase shrinks, being pushed both downward and inward. Beyond 1AU the chemistry changes most significantly in a UV-rich background; the atmosphere becomes more H2O, OH, and atomic-rich. Hydrocarbons, however, reside primarily well within 1AU of the disk, thus their abundance and distribution is not impacted by the UV field, up to a 10^6 G0. The products of photodissociation and photochemistry are formed deeper into the disk with increasing UV background field strength beyond 1AU, impacting the chemistry near the midplane. Effectively a `reset' chemistry takes place, with an enhancement of atoms, simple molecules, and molecules in the gas-phase. Planets that form in highly irradiated regions will be exposed to a different chemical reservoir in the gas and ice-phases than that in an isolated disk, and the impact from the UV background should only be detectable in highly irradiated disks (~10^6 G_0).",

        "abstract": "Context. Previous studies have suggested that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory elements compared to other solar twins or analogs, potentially as a result of planet formation. However, such conclusions are often limited by inhomogeneous samples and a lack of direct comparison with stars known to host planets.   Aims. We aim to perform a homogeneous and precise abundance analysis of solar twins and analogs that host planets, to investigate possible chemical signatures associated with planet formation.   Methods. We obtain high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio Magellan/MIKE spectra for 25 solar-like stars, including 22 confirmed or candidate planet hosts and three comparison stars. Stellar parameters and elemental abundances for 23 elements (from C to Eu) are derived through a strict line-by-line differential analysis relative to the Sun.   Results. Our sample spans [Fe/H] = -0.23 to +0.18 dex and includes 20 solar analogs, six of which are solar twins. Typical abundance uncertainties range from 0.01 to 0.05 dex for lighter elements (e.g., Fe, Si, C, O, Na) and up to 0.1 dex for neutron-capture elements. The Sun is consistently depleted in refractory elements relative to all solar analogs and twins, regardless of planet type. Stars hosting small planets tentatively show slightly stronger refractory element depletion than those hosting giant planets, though the difference is not yet statistically significant.   Conclusions. We emphasize the need for strictly differential, line-by-line analyses relative to the Sun, as well as careful consideration of systematic differences between instruments, to ensure consistency and the homogeneity required to achieve our goals.",

Using three levels of physical complexity, we model systems of accreting white dwarfs (WDs) with masses of 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 M$_\\odot$ orbiting evolving Solar-like stars with 1, 2, and 3 M$_\\odot$. We show that systems alternate between standard wind accretion and Wind Roche Lobe Overflow (WRLO) regimes during periods of high mass-loss rate experienced by the donor star (the peak of red giant phase and/or thermal pulses). For some configurations, the standard wind accretion has mass accretion efficiencies similar to those obtained by WRLO regime. Tidal forces play a key role in compact systems, leading to orbital shrinkage and enhanced accretion efficiency. We find that systems with high-mass WDs ($\\geq 1$ M$_\\odot$) and massive donors (2--3 M$_\\odot$) are the only ones to reach the Chandrasekhar limit. Interestingly, the majority of our simulations reach the Roche lobe overflow condition that is not further simulated given the need of more complex hydrodynamical simulations. Our analysis shows that increasing physical realism, by including drag and tides, systematically leads to more compact final orbital configurations. Comparison with compact known symbiotic systems seems to suggest that they are very likely experiencing orbital decay produced by tidal forces.",

We aim to accurately quantify the velocity at which round {\\alpha}-spots traverse the solar disk as a function of their latitude, and compare these rates to those of the quiet-Sun and other sunspot types. We then extend this work to other stars and investigate how differential rotation affects the modulation of stellar light curves by introducing a generalized stellar differential rotation law. We manually identify and track 105 {\\alpha}-sunspots in the 6173 {\\AA} continuum using the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We measure the angular velocities of each spot through center-of-mass and geometric ellipse-fitting methods to derive a differential rotation law for round {\\alpha}-sunspots. Results. Using over a decade of HMI data we derive a differential rotation law for {\\alpha}-sunspots. When compared to previous measurements we find that {\\alpha}-sunspots rotate 1.56% faster than the surrounding quiet-Sun, but 1.35% slower than the average sunspot population. This supports the hypothesis that the depth at which flux tubes are anchored influences sunspot motions across the solar disk. We extend this analysis to other stars by introducing a scaling law based on the rotation rates of these stars. This scaling law is implemented into the Stellar Activity Grid for Exoplanets (SAGE) code to illustrate how differential rotation alters the photometric modulation of active stars. Our findings emphasize the necessity of considering differential rotation effects when modeling stellar activity and exoplanet transit signatures",

Besides obtaining the respective waveform profiles that include rates of change in binary separation and orbital frequency, an expression for the mass-shell surface energy was derived to compute the anticipated energy radiated as gravitational waves. In this study, we revisit the surface energy derivation using a variational method that was recently used, and we recover the energy's dependence on the compact binary's reduced mass, symmetric mass ratio, and the normalized rotational speed at merger. For 31 out of 93 cataloged GW events within the O1, O2 and O3 observation runs, we compute the anticipated energy radiated as gravitational waves and compare these values with the observed energy, either directly measured or extracted from the total-minus-remnant mass difference. It is shown that the model presented in this work agrees well with observed energy measurements, within the error range and via 1:1 ratios spanning from $0.828$ to $0.997$ across 29 example events (the mean value of these 29 ratios being $0.941$), with GW190403_051519 serving as an outlier with the 1:1 ratio of $0.462$, demonstrating the precision and universality of the energy expression to be applied to current and future detections.",

Existing methods, such as continuum fitting, X-ray reflection spectroscopy, and quasi-periodic oscillation analysis, suffer from limitations in accuracy, interpretability, and scalability. In this work, a hybrid approach is proposed in which theoretical models based on the Teukolsky formalism are integrated with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). A PINN model is developed to solve the linearized spin problem in the scalar case, with physical constraints directly embedded into the training process. Annotated data are not required; instead, the model is trained using the differential operator and boundary conditions as supervision. It is demonstrated that the PINN converges reliably, with residual loss values below 10 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) on the order of $10^{-7}$. Benchmarking results indicate that the proposed method outperforms both classical and data-driven machine learning approaches in terms of AUC and sensitivity, while also exhibiting superior interpretability, generalizability, and adherence to physical principles, with moderate computational cost. Potential extensions include integration with general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) solvers and application to real observational data. These findings support the viability of physics-based machine learning as a robust framework for accurate and interpretable black hole spin estimation.",

        "abstract": "In the present article, we propose a very simple parametrization of the Hubble function without parametrizing the dark components of the Universe. One of the novelties of the parametrization is that it may include a wide variety of the cosmological models, such as dark energy (both noninteracting and interacting fluids), modified gravity, cosmological matter creation and other known scenarios. The model is constrained with the latest astronomical probes from Hubble parameter measurements, three distinct versions of Type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+, DESY5, Union3) and baryon acoustic oscillations from Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument data releases 1 and 2. Our results suggest a mild deviation from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model for most of the combined datasets. We also find that our model is thermodynamically consistent and performs well in the model comparison tests.",

This study continues our previous simulation work that successfully reproduced the X7.1-class solar flare (Matsumoto et al. 2025). In this study, we performed a data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation using the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) as the initial condition to investigate the X9.0-class solar flare. The NLFFF showed the sheared field lines, resulting in the tether-cutting reconnection, the magnetic flux ropes (MFRs), and eventually led to eruption. The magnetic reconnection during the pre-eruption phase plays a critical role in accelerating the subsequent eruption, which is driven by torus instability and magnetic reconnection. Furthermore, our simulation results are consistent with several observational features associated with the X9.0 flare. This simulation could reproduce diverse phenomena associated with the X9.0 flare, including the tether-cutting reconnection, the flare ribbons and the flare loops, the transverse field enhancement, and the remote brightening away from the flare ribbons. However, the initial trigger, magnetic flux emergence, was inferred from observations rather than explicitly modeled, and future comprehensive simulations should incorporate this mechanism directly.",

Here we present the \"Solar Activity AI Forecaster\", a scalable dual data-model driven framework built on foundational models, integrating expert knowledge to autonomously replicate human forecasting tasks with quantifiable outputs. It is implemented in the OODA paradigm and comprises three modules: a Situational Perception Module that generates daily solar situation awareness maps by integrating multi-modal observations; In-Depth Analysis Tools that characterize key solar features (active regions, coronal holes, filaments); and a Flare Prediction Module that forecasts strong flares for the full solar disk and active regions. Executed within a few minutes, the model outperforms or matches human forecasters in generalization across multi-source data, forecast accuracy, and operational efficiency. This work establishes a new paradigm for AI-based space weather forecasting, demonstrating AI's potential to enhance forecast accuracy and efficiency, and paving the way for autonomous operational forecasting systems.",

        "abstract": "The air shower array Carpet-3 detected a 300 TeV photon from the direction of GRB 221009A at 4536 s after the Fermi-GBM trigger for this event. If the association with this gamma-ray burst is real, it poses two puzzles. First, why was this photon not absorbed by the extragalactic background light? ``New physics'' beyond the Standard Model is required to explain how it managed to reach Earth from a cosmological distance. Second, why was this photon detected when the VHE afterglow observed by LHAASO already faded? A novel astrophysical mechanism is required to explain this delay. In this work we show that Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which arises as a low-energy limit of certain quantum gravity theories, can solve both puzzles. It shifts thresholds of particle interaction and changes the opacity of the extragalactic background, and cause energy-dependent variations of the photon velocity, which changes the photon time of flight. We investigate the LIV parameter space assuming that the 300 TeV photon is a part of the VHE afterglow detected by LHAASO in the TeV range. We identify viable solutions and place stringent two-sided constraints on the LIV energy scale required to resolve the observational puzzles. First-order LIV appears to be incompatible with the constraints set by analyzing the TeV afterglow of this GRB. Viable solutions emerge for higher orders. In particular, the commonly studied second-order subluminal LIV with $E_{\\rm LIV2} = 1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56} \\times 10^{-7} E_{\\rm Pl}$ (95.4% credibility level; $E_{\\rm Pl}$ is the Planck energy) is consistent with all the observed data.",

The correlation has a Spearman's rank coefficient of $-0.70 \\pm 0.13$ at a significance of $>3\\sigma$ and a linear regression fit of $\\alpha_{>10d} = -0.29^{+0.19}_{-0.28} \\log \\left(L_{\\mathrm{Radio,10d}} \\right) + 8.12^{+8.86}_{-5.88}$. This finding suggests that more luminous radio afterglows have higher average rates of decay than less luminous ones. We use a Monte Carlo simulation to show the correlation is not produced by chance or selection effects at a confidence level of $>3\\sigma$. Previous studies found this relation in optical/UV, X-ray and GeV afterglow light curves, and we have now extended it to radio light curves. The Spearman's rank coefficients and the linear regression slopes for the correlation in each waveband are all consistent within $1\\sigma$. We discuss how these new results in the radio band support the effects of observer viewing geometry, and time-varying microphysical parameters, as possible causes of the correlation as suggested in previous works.",

Based on 5.5 years of NICER monitoring, we detected a glitch around MJD 59300, characterized by a fractional frequency jump of approximately $2\\times 10^{-6}$. We constructed semi-phase-coherent timing solutions for pre- and post-glitch epochs, allowing for phase alignment of multi-instrument data and a subsequent measurement of the pulsed spectrum of the pulsar. This analysis confirmed previously-reported spectral curvature and revealed a peak energy of $73^{+85}_{-26}$ keV in the pulsar's spectral energy distribution (SED), based on a logpar model fit of the pulsed spectrum. We discuss these findings within the framework of pulsar magnetospheric emission scenarios. The PWN's X-ray spectrum is well-described by a power law with a photon index of $2.1\\pm0.3$, softer than previously-reported measurements. We also characterized the X-ray emission from another extended X-ray source AX J1837.3$-$0652 within the extent of HESS J1837$-$069. Based on the spatial and spectral properties of these X-ray sources, we propose a leptonic emission scenario for HESS J1837$-$069 and demonstrate its feasibility through SED modeling.

When searching using fast folding algorithm (FFA), periodic pulsar radiation at a frequency of 111 MHz was not detected. In 3321 observation sessions lasting 5 minutes, 35 strong pulses were detected with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) greater than 10. Some of the pulses have a complex multi-peak structure consisting of narrow details, while some of the pulses are single-component. The peak flux densities of the details of these strong pulses range from 2 to 11 Jy. The peak value ($S_{\\rm p} = 2$\\,Jy) and the integral ($S_{\\rm i} = 7$\\,mJy) flux density in the average profile were obtained from the strong pulses. It is shown that pulsar pulses in the meter-wavelength range arrive sporadically, and the pulsar is similar in its properties to a rotating radio transient (RRAT). The pulsar has the minimal dispersion measure, the minimal distance from the Sun, and the minimal pseudo-luminosity of all known pulsars. Pulsar timing made it possible to improve the previously obtained value of the period ($P$) and to estimate the period derivative ($\\dot P$). In the dependency of timing residuals (TRs) from the times of arrival (TOA) of pulses discontinuities are visible, when no pulses were observed.

        "abstract": "Recent observations and simulations have shown that a buckled bar in the face-on view can be considered as a combination of a long flat bar and a short round barlens (corresponding to the boxy/peanut bulge in the edge-on view). However, the barlens component can be misidentified as the bulge, potentially leading to inaccurate bulge parameter measurements in two-dimensional (2D) image decomposition. Our goal is to explore the optimal method for modeling the barlens component and to understand its impact on bulge parameter measurements in 2D image decomposition. We first analyze mock images from two different simulations (with/without bulge) to verify our decomposition method. We then apply the method to two nearby barred galaxies, NGC 1533 and NGC 7329, from the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey (CGS). Using GALFIT, we conduct 2D image decomposition by gradually increasing the complexity of model configurations. We also explore the effects of inclination by projecting the simulated galaxy to various viewing angles and analyzing the variations in bulge and barlens parameters. From the mock images, we find that the bulge-to-total ratio (B/T) could be overestimated by 50$\\%$ without considering the barlens component; the S\\'ersic index and effective radius of the bulge are also affected to varying degrees. The decomposition results of the two CGS galaxies are consistent with our mock image tests. Uncertainties of the structural parameters of the bulge and barlens are larger at higher inclination angels due to the strong projection effect in the central region. Our findings underscore the necessity of accurately modeling the barlens, revealing that its inclusion in 2D image decomposition can lead to a decrease in B/T by $\\sim$30-50$\\%$, with other bulge parameters, such as the S\\'ersic index and effective radius, also affected.",

Hadronic interaction models re-tuned after early LHC data give more consistent results among each other compared to the first generation of models, but still can't reproduce extended air shower data (EAS) consistently resulting in the so-called \"muon puzzle\". Using more recent LHC data like in the QGSJET-III model improve further the description of EAS by such a model but is not enough to resolve the discrepancy. On the other hand, the EPOS project is a theoretical global approach aiming at describing data from very fundamental electron-positron interactions to central heavy ions collisions. We will demonstrate that this approach can provide new constraints, changing the correlation between the measured data at mid-rapidity and the predicted particle production at large rapidities, which drive the EAS development. Thus, using the same accelerator data, different predictions are obtained in air shower simulations in much better agreement with the current air shower data (for both the maximum shower development depth Xmax and the energy spectrum of the muons at ground). Using the EPOS LHC-R model, the detailed changes will be addressed and their consequences on EAS observable at various energies.",

        "abstract": "Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a powerful probe of the early universe due to their ability to free-stream across cosmic history. We study GW production in a compelling scenario where a rotating axion(-like) field becomes relevant for a brief period in the early universe before transitioning into a kination fluid and rapidly dissipating its energy through cosmic expansion. During this short epoch, the curvature perturbation can be predominantly sourced by the rotating axion and may significantly exceed the adiabatic component. Moreover, axion field perturbations grow on superhorizon scales during this phase. These effects can generate a strong stochastic background of induced GWs. This GW background also exhibits a pronounced large-scale anisotropy inherited from the axion fluctuations, serving as a distinctive signature of the scenario. Importantly, the transient nature of axion relevance enables this scenario to evade stringent bounds on large-scale perturbations. We analyze various observational constraints and find that both the amplitude and anisotropy of the resulting GW signal could be accessible to future detectors.",

For the neutrino-emitting Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, we reproduce the neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube, while satisfying gamma-ray constraints. We also consider a transient corona scenario, potentially emerging in non-jetted tidal disruption events like AT 2019dsg, and show that early-stage cascade feedback can impact proton acceleration and radiation processes in weaker coronae, producing delayed optical/ultraviolet, X-ray, and neutrino emissions of $\\mathcal O(100~\\rm d)$.

We present \\texttt{tilepy}, a Python library, and a tool to optimize the follow-up of poorly localized transient events. \\texttt{tilepy} is used for GWs as well as other poorly localized events such as gamma-ray bursts detected by Fermi-GBM and neutrino candidates from IceCube. \\texttt{tilepy} has also been optimized to integrate smoothly with multiple ground-based observatories operating individually or simultaneously with diverse observational configurations. In this contribution, we introduce the latest developments from \\texttt{tilepy}, mainly the ability to operate with space-based observatories while taking into consideration factors such as Earth, Sun, and Moon occultation and South Atlantic Anomaly passage.

It has long been theorized that GRBs can emit very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays that can reach the TeV level. Although current-generation Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), such as H.E.S.S., have been observing GRBs since 2002, the first detection of GRBs by IACTs occurred only 16 years later, in 2018, raising the question of why no detections were made during these years. We investigate all GRBs detected by the Swift Observatory with redshift measurements over the past two decades. Using the phenomenological relationship between X-ray and gamma rays and taking into consideration extragalactic background light absorption effects and instrument response functions, we search for any missed opportunities for GRBs that could have been detected by the three IACTs: H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS, and present the best candidates. We find that the missing detections can be explained by the low rate of detectable GRBs at VHE, which we quantify as < 1 per year. We also find that with the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), this rate can increase to 4 per year.",

        "abstract": "We study the imprint of magnetic fields on gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase of eccentric binary neutron star systems. While observations indicate that neutron stars typically exhibit strong magnetic fields in the range of $10^{14}$-$10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{G}$, theoretical models allow for fields as high as $ \\sim 10^{17-18}\\,\\mathrm{G}$. In binaries, the fate of these fields depends on the formation pathway: in systems formed through isolated evolution, magnetic fields may decay over long inspiral timescales. In contrast, binaries formed via dynamical capture can retain substantial eccentricity and strong fields until merger, potentially altering the gravitational waveform. We consider two magnetic effects: magnetic interaction between the neutron stars and electromagnetic radiation from the system's effective dipole, and identify regimes where each dominates. Using a perturbative framework, we compute the associated energy loss and gravitational wave phase evolution. We find that for binaries with strong and comparable magnetic fields, $10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{G}$ fields may be detectable up to $\\sim 10 \\, \\mathrm{Mpc}$ with DECIGO and the Einstein Telescope, while $10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{G}$ fields extend the reach to several hundred Mpc.

In contrast, LIGO is limited to galactic distances: $10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{G}$ fields are detectable only within $\\sim 100\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$, and only ultrastrong fields ($\\sim 10^{16}$-$10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{G}$) are potentially observable at Gpc distances. In highly asymmetric systems, where dipole radiation dominates, the gravitational wave dephasing is significantly suppressed, reducing the detection horizon. These findings suggest that current and future gravitational wave observatories may be capable of identifying magnetized binary systems.",

This study explores the role of fast CME interactions in SGRE production during CME clusters, which we define as a series of CMEs linked to >C-class flares with waiting times $\\,$1 CME-associated major (>M-class) flare. The study identified 76 major ARs between 2011 and 2019, of which 12 produced all SGRE events. SGRE-producing ARs exhibit higher median values for the speed of their fastest CMEs (2013 vs. 775${\\rm \\,km\\,s^{-1}}$) and the class of their strongest flares (X1.8 vs. M5.8), compared to SGRE-lacking ARs. They also produced relatively faster CMEs (median speed: 1418 vs. 1206.5${\\rm \\,km\\,s^{-1}}$), with the SGRE-associated CMEs occurring during periods of higher CME rates than typical fast CME epochs. Twelve of 22 (54.5%) SGRE events and 5 of 7 (71.4%) long-duration (>$10\\,$h) SGRE events occurred during CME clusters, with high chances of CME-CME interactions.

We investigate dependencies of the long-term optical variability amplitudes and timescales on (i) supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, luminosity, and Eddington ratio to explore the influence of accretion disk dynamics and radiative processes; (ii) X-ray properties, such as spectral photon indices and fluxes, to study the effect of high-energy emission mechanisms; and (iii) radio characteristics, such as integrated fluxes and radio loudness, which indicate jet activity. Our findings confirm a positive correlation between the variability time scale and both the SMBH mass and luminosity, suggesting that these physical parameters significantly impact the optical variability timescale. Conversely, no significant dependence is found between optical variability and X-ray properties, indicating that high-energy processes may not substantially influence long-term optical variability. Additionally, a weak anti-correlation between optical variability and radio parameters suggests that jet activity has a negligible effect on causing long-term AGN variability. These results support the hypothesis that long-term optical variability in AGN is primarily governed by thermal emission from the accretion disk. Further investigations with larger samples are essential to refine these correlations and develop robust physical models integrating black hole properties, accretion disk physics, and multi-wavelength radiative transfer.",

Much information on the composition and formation of exoplanets and circumstellar debris disks can only be achieved via direct imaging. Direct imaging is challenging because of the small angular separations (< 1 arcsec) and high star-to-planet flux ratios such as ~1e9 for a Jupiter analog or ~1e10 for an Earth analog in the visible. Atmospheric turbulence prohibits reaching such high flux ratios on the ground, so observations must be made above the Earth's atmosphere. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman), planned to launch in late 2026, will be the first space-based observatory to demonstrate high-contrast imaging with active wavefront control using its Coronagraph Instrument. The instrument's main purpose is to mature the various technologies needed for a future flagship mission to image and characterize Earth-like exoplanets. These technologies include two high-actuator-count deformable mirrors, photon-counting detectors, two complementary wavefront sensing and control loops, and two different coronagraph types.

In this paper, we study preheating and gravitational waves after inflation in a large-field, regularized hilltop potential where inflation takes place in the concave plateau. The inflaton, $\\phi$, is coupled to a subdominant scalar field, $\\chi$, through a quartic coupling. After inflation ends, $\\phi$ oscillates about the potential minimum and becomes inhomogeneous. The growth of the fluctuation modes, $\\delta\\phi_k$ and $\\delta\\chi_k$, in a homogeneous, oscillating background is analyzed in linear perturbation theory, revealing that small modes likely experience broad self-resonance or external parametric resonance. To determine if the resonances are sufficiently strong to cause unstable growth of the modes we perform a lattice simulation.

The coupling term $\\xi R \\chi^2$ significantly enhances resonant particle production compared to minimal coupling scenarios. Consequently, the produced $\\chi$ particles rescattering off the homogeneous inflaton condensate $\\phi$, generating abundant $\\delta\\phi$ quanta within very short time intervals. This process leads to characteristic enhancements in the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations at scales corresponding to the moments of particle production. When this occurs at small scales, the power spectrum amplitude can reach as high as $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$. Furthermore, analysis of the equilateral bispectrum shows that this mechanism also induces substantial non-Gaussian features.",

        "title": "Reconciling Inflation with Hubble Anisotropies",
        "abstract": "There have been persistent suggestions, based on several diverse data sets, that the cosmic expansion is not exactly isotropic. It is not easy to develop a coherent theoretical account of such a ``Hubble anisotropy'', for, in standard General Relativity, intuition suggests that it contradicts the predictions of the very successful Inflationary hypothesis. We put this intuition on a firm basis, by proving that if we [a] make use of an Inflationary theory in which Inflation isotropises spatial geometry -- $\\,$ this, of course, includes the vast majority of such theories -- $\\,$ and if [b] we insist on assuming that spacetime has a strictly metric geometry (one in which the geometry is completely determined by a metric tensor), then indeed all aspects of the ``Hubble field'' must be isotropic. Conversely, should a Hubble anisotropy be confirmed, then either we must contrive to build anisotropy into Inflation from the outset, or we will have to accept that spacetime geometry is not strictly metric. We argue that allowing spacetime torsion to be non-zero would be by far the most natural way to accommodate such observations. Such theories make firm predictions, as for example that there should be a correlation between the degree of anisotropy at the end of Inflation and a certain specific component of the Hubble tension.",

        "abstract": "With the knowledge and statistical precision derived from two decades of measurement, the Pierre Auger Observatory has significantly deepened our understanding of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays while unearthing an increasingly complex astrophysical landscape and exposing tensions with hadronic interaction models. The field now demands the mass of individual cosmic-ray primaries as an observable with an exposure that only the 3000-square-kilometer surface array of the Observatory can provide. Access to the primary mass hinges on the disentanglement of the electromagnetic and muonic components of extensive air showers. To achieve this, scintillator and radio detectors have been installed atop each existing water-Cherenkov detector of the surface array, whose dynamic range has also been enhanced through the installation of small-area PMTs. Additionally, the timing and signal resolution of all detector stations have been improved through upgraded station electronics, and underground muon counters have been installed in a region of the array with denser spacing. As the commissioning of the final components of AugerPrime reaches its conclusion and the enhanced array comes fully online, we present the realization of its design, its performance, and the first results from this now multi-hybrid observatory.",

        "abstract": "The radiation physics of bright prompt optical emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains a puzzle. Assuming that the GRB ejecta is structured, we investigated this issue by characterizing the ejecta as an ultra-relativistic uniform jet core surrounded by a mild-relativistic cocoon. The mixed jet-cocoon (MJC) region can accelerate particles through the shear acceleration mechanism. Parameterizing the radial velocity profile of the MJC region with an exponential function and assuming a uniform magnetic field configuration, we show that the synchrotron radiation of the shear-accelerated electrons can produce a bright optical flash. Emission of the self-synchrotron Compton (SSC) process of the electron population can result in an X-ray excess and an extra MeV-GeV gamma-ray flash relative to the Band function component in the keV-MeV band, which is attributed to the synchrotron radiation of the shock-accelerated electrons in the jet core. Our model reasonably represents the extremely bright optical flash and spectral characteristics of GRBs 990123, 080319B, and 130427A. The inferred magnetic field strength of the MJC region is above $10^{5}$ G, potentially suggesting that the jets of these GRBs are highly magnetized.",

We found that the source traverses through the hard, intermediate, and soft spectral states during the outburst. The spectrum in all states can be described using soft emissions from the thermal disk and hard emissions from the coronal regions. The variation in the inner disk temperature and normalization of the disk indicates the motion of the truncated disk across these different spectral states. We confirmed the presence of broad features, Type-C, and Type-B QPOs in the power spectra of different spectral states. We investigated the fractional rms and lags of all the variability features and discovered that the lag swung between positive and negative during the outburst evolution. While modeling the features with a simple model that considers variations in accretion parameters such as the accretion rate, heating rate, and inner disk radius, along with delays between them, we found a dynamic reversal in the origin of variability between the corona and the disk. Furthermore, our results are consistent with previous works and a radio study conducted on this source during its outburst.",

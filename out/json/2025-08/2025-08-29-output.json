This directly matches the 'Near-Field Cosmology' criterion, as it concerns the abundance and nature of sub-galactic dark matter halos and the threshold for galaxy formation. The work is highly relevant and provides strong observational support for a key prediction of \u039bCDM.",

        "title": "The First RELHIC? Cloud-9 is a Starless Gas Cloud",
        "abstract": "FAST observations have recently identified a compact HI cloud (hereafter Cloud-9) in the vicinity of the spiral galaxy M94. This identification has been confirmed independently by VLA and GBT observations. Cloud-9 has the same recession velocity as M94, and is therefore at a similar distance ($\\sim$4.4 Mpc). It is compact ($\\sim$1$'$ radius, or $\\sim$1.4 kpc), dynamically cold ($W_{50}=12$ km/s), non-rotating, and fairly massive, with an HI mass of $\\sim 10^{6}$ $M_{\\odot}$. Here we present deep HST/ACS imaging designed to search for a luminous stellar counterpart. We visually rule out the presence of any dwarf galaxy with stellar mass exceeding 10$^{3.5}$$M_{\\odot}$. A more robust color-magnitude diagram-based analysis rules out a 10$^{4}$$M_{\\odot}$ stellar counterpart with 99.5$\\%$ confidence. The non-detection of a luminous component reinforces the interpretation that this system is a Reionization-Limited HI Cloud (RELHIC); i.e., a starless dark matter halo filled with hydrostatic gas in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic ultraviolet background. Our results make Cloud-9 the leading RELHIC candidate of any known compact HI cloud. This provides strong support for a cornerstone prediction of the $\\Lambda$CDM model, namely the existence of gas-filled starless dark matter halos on sub-galactic mass scales, and constrains the present-day threshold halo mass for galaxy formation.",

        "abstract": "We analyze three epochs of HST imaging over 20 years for the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, measuring precise proper motions for 119 stars and combining them with 1760 existing line-of-sight velocities. This catalog yields the first radially-resolved 3D velocity dispersion profiles for Sculptor. We confirm mild oblate rotation, with major-axis velocities reaching $\\sim 2$ km s$^{-1}$ beyond 20.0 arcmin. Using a methodology similar to that in the first paper in this series, we solve the Jeans equations in oblate axisymmetric geometry to infer the galaxy's mass profile. Our modeling reveals a significant degeneracy due to the unknown galaxy inclination, which is overlooked under spherical symmetry assumptions. This degeneracy allows acceptable fits across a range of dark matter profiles, from cuspy to cored. While we do not directly constrain the inclination with our Jeans models, higher-order line-of-sight velocity moments provide useful additional constraints: comparisons with scalefree models from de Bruijne et al. (1996) favor highly flattened (more face-on) configurations. Adopting an inclination well consistent with these comparisons ($i = 57.1$ degrees), we find, alongside radial velocity anisotropy, a dark matter density slope of $\\Gamma_{\\rm dark} = 0.29^{+0.31}_{-0.41}$ within the radial extent of the 3D velocity data, ruling out a cusp with $\\Gamma_{\\rm dark} \\leq -1$ at 99.8% confidence. This confidence increases for lower inclinations and decreases drastically for nearly edge-on configurations. The results qualitatively agree with $\\Lambda$CDM, SIDM, and Fuzzy DM scenarios that predict core formation, while our specific measurements provide quantitative constraints on the prescriptions of feedback, cross sections, or particle masses required by these models, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are excellent targets for indirect dark matter (DM) searches using gamma-ray telescopes because they are thought to have high DM content and a low astrophysical background. The sensitivity of these searches is improved by combining the observations of dSphs made by different gamma-ray telescopes. We present the results of a combined search by the most sensitive currently operating gamma-ray telescopes, namely: the satellite-borne Fermi-LAT telescope; the ground-based imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope arrays H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS; and the HAWC water Cherenkov detector. Individual datasets were analyzed using a common statistical approach. Results were subsequently combined via a global joint likelihood analysis. We obtain constraints on the velocity-weighted cross section $\\langle \\sigma \\mathit{v} \\rangle$ for DM self-annihilation as a function of the DM particle mass. This five-instrument combination allows the derivation of up to 2-3 times more constraining upper limits on $\\langle \\sigma \\mathit{v} \\rangle$ than the individual results over a wide mass range spanning from 5 GeV to 100 TeV. Depending on the DM content modeling, the 95% confidence level observed limits reach $1.5\\times$10$^{-24}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$ and $3.2\\times$10$^{-25}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$, respectively, in the $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ annihilation channel for a DM mass of 2 TeV.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the quenching mechanisms in dwarf galaxies is crucial for constraining models of galaxy formation and evolution. In this vein, isolated dwarf galaxies offer valuable insight by helping disentangle the relative roles of internal and environmental processes in shutting down star formation. Here we report the discovery of a quiescent early-type dwarf galaxy (dE), SDSS J011754.86+095819.0 (hereafter dE01+09), located in a nearly isolated environment at a projected distance of approximately one megaparsec from its most likely host group, the NGC 524 group. dE01+09 has M_r = -15.72 and g-r = 0.67 mag and its light profile is well described by a S\\'ersic function with an index n = 1.1, consistent with typical dEs. Using optical spectroscopy from the DESI survey, we derive its simple stellar population properties, finding an intermediate luminosity-weighted age of 8.3$\\pm$1.4 Gyr and a subsolar metallicity of -1.19$\\pm$0.21 dex -- characteristics comparable to those of classical quiescent dEs. We propose that NGC 524 may represent an extreme example of group dynamics, in which a member galaxy, dE01+09, is ejected from its host group and subsequently evolves as an isolated system in the field.",

        "abstract": "Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) originate from massive stars that lose their envelopes through binary interactions or stellar winds. The connection between SESN subtypes and their progenitors remains poorly understood, as does the influence of initial mass, binarity, explodability, and metallicity on their evolutionary pathways, relative rates, ejecta masses, and progenitor ages. Here, we investigate these properties across a wide metallicity range (0.01-2 $Z_{\\odot}$) using POSYDON, a state-of-the-art population synthesis code that incorporates detailed single- and binary-star model grids. We find that the common-envelope channel contributes less than 6% of SESNe, since unstable mass transfer is found less frequent than previously thought and rarely leads to CE survival when envelope binding energies are computed from detailed stellar models. The secondary channel accounts for less than 11%, while the vast majority of SESNe originate from primary stars in binaries undergoing stable mass-transfer episodes. These interactions maintain a largely metallicity-independent SESN parameter space, making the overall SESN rate almost insensitive to metallicity. In contrast, subtype fractions exhibit strong metallicity dependence, though their exact values remain affected by classification thresholds. The age distributions and therefore the progenitor masses of different SESN types also vary significantly with metallicity, revealing metallicity-dependent trends that can be tested observationally. Predicted SESN ejecta masses remain nearly constant across metallicity, in contrast to single-star models, and fall within observed ranges. Future transient surveys, combined with statistical environmental studies that constrain metallicity dependence, will provide decisive tests of these predictions and of the dominant role of binary interactions in shaping SESNe.",

LISA data is expected to include several such astrophysical SGWBs, including the notable Galactic binary foreground, SGWBs from white dwarf binary populations in satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, and the SGWB from extragalactic stellar-origin binary black holes far from merger. To characterize these astrophysical signals and attempt to seek out possible underlying backgrounds of cosmological origin, it will be necessary to separate the contribution of each SGWB from that of the others. Crucially, several of these SGWBs are expected to be highly anisotropic on the sky, providing a powerful tool for spectral separation. To this end, we present BLIP 2.0: a flexible, GPU-accelerated framework for simulation and Bayesian analysis of arbitrary combinations of isotropic and anisotropic SGWBs. We leverage these capabilities to demonstrate for the first time spectral separation of the Galactic foreground, the Large Magellanic Cloud SGWB, and the SGWB from extragalactic stellar-origin binaries, and show a proof-of-concept for placing upper limits on the detection of an underlying isotropic cosmological SGWB in the presence of multiple astrophysical foregrounds.",

We focus on scenarios where the dark matter-baryon scattering cross-section scales as $\\sigma(v) =\\sigma_{0} v^n$, with $\\sigma_{0}$ being the normalization constant, $v$ the relative velocity between dark matter and baryons, and $n$ characterizing the velocity dependence. Specifically, we emphasize two cases: Coulomb-like interaction ($n = -4$) and velocity-independent interaction ($n = 0$). Using detailed simulations of the 21-cm power spectrum and the Fisher matrix formalism, we forecast the sensitivity of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), which targets the frequency range 50-225 MHz, to both IDM and astrophysical parameters. We marginalize over key astrophysical uncertainties, including star formation efficiency, ionizing photon escape fraction, and X-ray luminosity. Our results demonstrate that 21-cm power spectrum measurements can significantly improve sensitivity to IDM cross-section, with at least a factor of five improvement over global signal forecasts for the $n=0$ case, and more than an order of magnitude enhancement for the $n=-4$ scenario. These forecasts also significantly improve upon the existing bounds from cosmic microwave background and Milky Way satellite abundance observations. Our analysis also shows that the IDM cross-section exhibits no correlation with the parameters associated with star formation efficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction of Population-II stars. However, we find that the Coulomb-like cross-section is positively correlated with X-ray luminosity. Our results highlight the critical role of accounting for astrophysical uncertainties in obtaining robust inferences of dark matter-baryon interactions from future 21-cm power spectrum observations.",

The forward modelling of observations, in particular of large-scale structure, often relies on large cosmological simulations. While the so-called separate universe approach allows one to account for the effect of curvature on the expansion rate in small sub-volumes, the non-Euclidean geometry is harder to accommodate. It becomes important when observables are computed over large distances, e.g. when photons travel to us from high redshift. Here we present a fully relativistic framework to run cosmological simulations for curved spatial geometry. The issue of consistent boundary conditions is solved by embedding a spherical cap of the curved spacetime into a hole within a flat exterior, where it can undergo free expansion. The geometric nature of gravity is made explicit in our framework, allowing for a consistent forward modelling of observables inside the curved patch. Our methodology would also work with any Newtonian code to a good approximation, requiring changes only to the initial conditions and post-processing.",

Two of these jellyfish galaxies, J1 and J2, are in a late-stage of stripping and show post-starburst features within their disk regions with star formation only in the tails.

The jellyfish galaxies are all blue-shifted with respect to the cluster and show velocity gradients of a few hundred $\\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$ across their tails.

Atmospheric parameters were determined for 548 young stars in the Orion complex (Orion A, B, OB1, and $\\lambda$ Ori) using the TONALLI code. For 340 slow rotators v sini $\\leq$ 30 km s$^{-1}$), we derived C, Mg, Si, K, Ti, and Fe abundances using 19 atomic lines, MARCS model atmospheres, and BACCHUS. To mitigate the impact of circumstellar material, we excluded stars with infrared excess identified via 2MASS and WISE photometry. We find sub-solar [X/H] abundance ratios, consistent across elements and among all four groups, suggesting a chemically homogeneous Orion complex. We computed [$\\alpha$/Fe] from [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [Ti/Fe], obtaining a median of $-0.14 \\pm 0.04$, about 0.10 dex lower than the value for nearby main-sequence stars ($-0.04 \\pm 0.04$) at similar [Fe/H]. This result aligns with predictions from Galactic chemical evolution models. Furthermore, the median [C/H] abundance we derived for Orion agrees with previous estimations based on the analysis of the ionized gas of the Orion nebula. This work sets the stage for extending the analysis to stars with circumstellar material and higher rotational velocities, which will not only improve our understanding of Orion, but also provide critical insight into the formation and evolution of young stars, as well as the chemical evolution of the Milky Way.",

        "abstract": "Stars and planets form within cold, dark molecular clouds. In these dense regions, where starlight cannot penetrate, cosmic rays (CRs) are the dominant source of ionization -- driving interstellar chemistry(Dalgarno (2006, PNAS, 103, 12269)), setting the gas temperature(Goldsmith et al. (1969, ApJ, 158, 173)), and enabling coupling to magnetic fields(McKee & Ostriker (2007, ARA&A, 45, 565; arXiv:0707.3514)). Together, these effects regulate the collapse of clouds and the onset of star formation. Despite this importance, the cosmic-ray ionization rate, $\\zeta$, has never been measured directly. Instead, this fundamental parameter has been loosely inferred from indirect chemical tracers and uncertain assumptions, leading to published values that span nearly two orders of magnitude and limiting our understanding of star formation physics. Here, we report the first direct detection of CR-excited vibrational H$_2$ emission, using \\textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) observations of the starless core Barnard 68 (B68). The observed emission pattern matches theoretical predictions for CR excitation precisely, confirming a decades-old theoretical proposal long considered observationally inaccessible. This result enables direct measurement of $\\zeta$, effectively turning molecular clouds into natural, light-year-sized, cosmic-ray detectors. It opens a transformative observational window into the origin, propagation, and role of cosmic rays in star formation and galaxy evolution.",

With the aim of further constraining the structure of L1544 as well as assessing the completeness of chemical networks, we turn to radiative transfer modelling of observed molecular lines towards this source. We obtained high-sensitivity and high-spectral resolution observations of HCO+ (J = 1 - 0), CS (J = 2 - 1), C34S (J = 2 - 1), H2CO (J ,Ka,Kc = 2,1,2 - 1,1,1), c-C3H2 (J,Ka,Kc = 2,1,2 - 1,0,1), SO (N,J = 2,3 - 1,2) and 34SO (N,J = 2,3 - 1,2) with the IRAM 30m telescope towards the dust peak of L1544. A non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium radiative transfer code is coupled to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to model the observations. We find that with just one transition for each isotope, the modelling cannot find a global minimum that fits the observations. The derived fractional abundance profiles are compared to those computed with chemical models. The observed transitions trace gas components with distinct dynamics at different distances along the radius of the core. Moreover, the results evidence a poor reproduction of sulphur chemistry by chemical modelling and stresses the need to include a more consistent S-depletion process to accurately reproduce the S-chemistry towards dense cores.",

By systematically analyzing a large sample of groups, we find a robust perpendicular alignment between group spin and filament orientation. Among all examined properties, only group mass and the distance to the nearest filament significantly affect the strength of this alignment: more massive groups and those closer to filaments exhibit a stronger perpendicular signal. In contrast, the alignment is largely insensitive to group richness, the stellar mass threshold used to select member galaxies, and redshift. We further quantify the bias introduced by using member galaxies as tracers of group spin, finding a typical misalignment angle of $\\sim38^\\circ$ between the spin measured from all dark matter particles and that inferred from member galaxies, independent of group richness or stellar mass cut. Our results provide a clear theoretical benchmark for interpreting observational measurements of spin-filament alignment and highlight the importance of considering group mass and environment.

The {\\it TESS} photometry revealed rotational modulation with a period of 1.6279247 days. Upon inspecting the residuals after removing the rotational period and its harmonics, we found additional frequencies around 15.8054 d$^{-1}$ which we later confirmed with ground-based observations as originating from a nearby star. Using high-resolution spectroscopy, we identified HD 100357 as an Ap Si/He-wk star exhibiting rotational modulation caused by surface abundance spots. The stellar parameters of HD 100357 were determined as $T_{\\rm eff}$ = 11,850 K, $\\log g$ = 4.57, $\\upsilon\\sin i$ = 60 km\\,s$^{-1}$, and an inclination angle $i$ = 72$^{\\circ}$. The detailed abundance analysis revealed strongly overabundant stratified silicon, an overabundance of iron-peak elements and rare earth elements combined with remarkably deficient helium. Mapping of Fe and Cr abundances revealed the existence of ring-shaped regions with a lower concentration of the elements. Their geometry might reflect the orientation of the hypothetical magnetic field of the star, oriented $\\sim$90$^{\\circ}$ to the rotational axis. HD 100357, with its strong chemical peculiarities and indications of possible magnetic fields, represents an interesting candidate for follow-up spectropolarimetric observations aimed at investigating its magnetic field topology and stellar activity.",

To calculate the dust temperature ($T_{dust}$) of the Interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies, POLARIS requires three essential parameters as an input - (1) The physical characteristics of galaxies such as the spatial distribution of stars and dust, which are taken from FirstLight galaxies. (2) The intrinsic properties of dust grains that are derived from theDiscrete Dipole Approximation Code (DDSCAT) model. (3) The optical properties of star-particles are in the form of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) which are extracted from the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) model. Our simulations produced the 3D maps of the equilibrium dust temperature along with the sight-line infrared emission maps of galaxies. Our results show the importance of excess heating of dust by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiations at high redshifts that results in increased Mid and Far infrared (M-FIR) dust emission.

        "abstract": "The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect is associated with galaxy clusters - extremely large and dense structures tracing the dark matter with a higher bias than isolated galaxies. We propose to use the tSZ data to separate galaxies from redshift surveys into distinct subpopulations corresponding to different densities and biases independently of the redshift survey systematics. Leveraging the information from different environments, as in density-split and density-marked clustering, is known to tighten the constraints on cosmological parameters, like $\\Omega_m$, $\\sigma_8$ and neutrino mass. We use data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in their region of overlap to demonstrate informative tSZ splitting of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We discover a significant increase in the large-scale clustering of DESI LRGs corresponding to detections starting from 1-2 sigma in the ACT DR6 + Planck tSZ Compton-$y$ map, below the cluster candidate threshold (4 sigma). We also find that such galaxies have higher line-of-sight coordinate (and velocity) dispersions and a higher number of close neighbors than both the full sample and near-zero tSZ regions. We produce simple simulations of tSZ maps that are intrinsically consistent with galaxy catalogs and do not include systematic effects, and find a similar pattern of large-scale clustering enhancement with tSZ effect significance. Moreover, we observe that this relative bias pattern remains largely unchanged with variations in the galaxy-halo connection model in our simulations. This is promising for future cosmological inference from tSZ-split clustering with semi-analytical models. Thus, we demonstrate that valuable cosmological information is present in the lower signal-to-noise regions of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich map, extending far beyond the individual cluster candidates.",

O-stars in young dense clusters, young sparse associations, and even low-mass clusters that formed in situ in the field have similar EB fractions. This uniformity suggests that the formation of close massive binaries depends on small-scale gas physics, e.g., fragmentation and migration within protostellar disks, whereas N-body interactions that scale with cluster density do not affect the close binary properties of massive stars that remain in clusters. Conversely, ejected O-stars in the field exhibit a lower close binary fraction. The EB fractions of field walkaways (projected velocities $v_{\\rm proj}$ $$ 24.5 km s$^{-1}$) are 7.3%$\\pm$1.0% and 4.7%$\\pm$1.0%, respectively. These values suggest that most field O-stars were dynamically ejected via N-body interactions from their birth clusters, whereas field O-stars that formed in situ or were kicked from supernova explosions in binaries contribute 17% and $<$28%, respectively, to the field population.",

        "abstract": "Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) represents a compelling alternative to collisionless dark matter, with diverse phenomenological signals from dwarf galaxy to galaxy cluster scales. We present new constraints on the SIDM cross section from the galaxy cluster MACS J0138-2155, host to the strongly lensed supernovae Requiem and Encore. Our analysis combines strong gravitational lensing with spatially resolved stellar kinematics of the central galaxy, employing several methodological advances over previous cluster-scale SIDM studies. The result is a self-consistent measurement of the density profile of MACS J0138-2155 across two orders of magnitude in radius. Our lensing and kinematics analyses individually yield highly consistent results, and from their combination we report a 95% confidence upper limit on the SIDM cross section of $\\sigma/m < 0.613$ cm$^2$/g, at an interaction velocity of $\\langle v_\\text{pair}\\rangle < 2090$ km/s. This constraint, derived from the most detailed single-system analysis to date, is competitive with previous cluster-scale limits while demonstrating the power of combining complementary gravitational probes. The methodology developed here advances precision cluster lens modeling and will inform future studies of dark matter physics, as well as time-delay cosmography in this unique strong lensing system. Additionally, our results imply SN Requiem will reappear sooner than previously reported, with a 1$\\sigma$ CL between January 2027 and November 2028 at H$_0 = 67.7$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.",

We carry out a population synthesis study of binary black hole formation and compare the results to the observed chirp masses of gravitational-wave events.

The LRDs have red NIRCam colors, F150W-F444W > 1, but flat NIRCam-MIRI colors, -0.5 < F444W - F770W < 0.5, suggesting weak warm/hot dust components. The LRDs have -1.0 < F1000W - F1500W < 1.1, suggestive of non-uniform rest near-IR properties within the sample. We model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the LRDs using the CIGALE and Prospector codes to assess how the differing templates impact the interpretation for LRDs for cases of: (1) models with star-forming stellar populations only; (2) active galactic nuclei (AGN) dominated models; and (3) composite AGN and star-forming models. Using the Bayesian information criterion, we find that six of the eight LRDs favor AGN models compared to star-forming models, though no model can fully reproduce all of the observed properties. Two LRDs with pronounced Balmer-breaks and broad H$_\\alpha$ have SEDs that can be reproduced with hot, dense-gas (log T/K=5-5.7, log n/cm$^{-3}$ = 9-11) models with low dust attenuation (A(V)~ 0.5mag). However, these models require an additional thermal component (800-1400K) to account for the MIRI data, and fail to reproduce the rest-UV and narrow [OIII] emission. The total bolometric emission from the dense-gas models, and possibly CIGALE AGN models, appear consistent with literature constraints in the far-IR and radio, and require log L$_{bol}$/L$_\\odot$ <12. These results suggest that our LRDs cannot be modeled entirely with standard templates, but instead require a novel treatment of gas conditions, AGN and star-formation.",

One-dimensional local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) abundances of K and other elements, including Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ni, were derived using spectral synthesis. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) corrections were applied to the K abundances by interpolating a precomputed grid of corrections based on stellar parameters and the LTE K abundance. We detected K I lines in seven stars with [Fe/H]$< -3.0$ and derived upper limits for other stars in the same metallicity regime, making this sample well-suited for investigating the nucleosynthesis origins of K in the early universe. We found that the [K/Fe] and [K/Ca] ratios of the seven stars are enhanced relative to the solar value, with a scatter of approximately 0.1 dex, as small as the typical measurement uncertainty. Under the assumption that each star formed from gas purely enriched by a single or a few massive stars' supernovae, the small scatter in [K/Fe] and [K/Ca], contrasted with the $\\sim$0.7 dex scatter in [Na/Mg] ratios (after NLTE correction), suggests that the production of K in massive stars or their supernovae is independent of the processes that drive Na/Mg variation. These findings demonstrate that K abundances in EMP stars, and their correlations with other elemental abundances, can serve as sensitive tracers of the physical mechanisms governing the final evolutionary stages of massive stars and their supernova explosions.",

We pair these observations with uniformly modeled host galaxies to understand how broadband afterglow luminosities are influenced by their environmental properties. We compare the X-ray and optical afterglow luminosities at 3 hr with projected physical and host-normalized galactocentric offsets, host stellar mass, star-formation rate (SFR), specific SFR, and stellar population age. In the radio band, we explore how these environmental properties may influence afterglow detectability. We find statistical support that X-ray afterglows are brighter in galaxies with younger ages, lower masses, and higher active star formation - trends that also scale with ISM density. While we also visualize these differences for optical afterglows, the only statistically significant trend is that they are brighter in hosts with higher SFR. We further find that X-ray (radio) afterglows are more luminous (more likely to be detected) at low projected offsets. Overall, this indicates that X-ray afterglow luminosity is the most predictable indicator of host environment among the three bands. We find the afterglow luminosities of three possible merger-driven long GRBs to be unremarkable compared to the traditional short GRB population, strengthening the case that these events arise from mergers. Finally we find that the estimated on-axis afterglow luminosity of GW170817 is in the faintest ~30%, aligning with its quiescent, old and massive host environment.",

        "title": "Using Symbolic Regression to Emulate the Radial Fourier Transform of the S\\'ersic profile for Fast, Accurate and Differentiable Galaxy Profile Fitting",
        "abstract": "Galaxy profile fitting is a ubiquitous technique that provides the backbone for photometric and morphological measurements in modern extragalactic surveys. A recent innovation in profile fitting algorithms is to render, or create, the model profile in Fourier space, which aims to provide faster and more accurate results. However, the most common parameterization, the S\\'ersic profile, has no closed form Fourier transform, requiring the use of computationally expensive approximations. In this paper our goal is to develop an emulator to mimic the radial Fourier transform of the S\\'ersic profile, for use in profile fitting. We first numerically compute the radial Fourier transform and demonstrate that it varies smoothly as a function of the S\\'ersic index and $k$, the spatial frequency coordinate. Using this set of numerically calculated transforms as a training set, we use symbolic regression to discover an equation which approximates its behavior. This ensures the emulator will be based on computationally efficient and differentiable building blocks. We implement this novel rendering method in the pysersic profile fitter, and ensure it is accurate by conducting both injection-recovery tests using model galaxy profiles and applying multiple rendering methods to a real sample of galaxies in HSC-SSP imaging. Crucially, the Fourier emulator rendering technique enables measurements of morphological parameters of galaxies 2.5 times faster than standard methods with minimal loss in accuracy. This increased performance while maintaining accuracy is a step that ensures these tools can continue to scale with the ever-increasing flow of incoming data.",

Many of the otherwise cumbersome intermediate steps can be avoided and the required boost operator elements can be quickly generated using recurrence relations of the underlying aberration kernel.

Recent theories further suggest that shock-shock collisions in stellar clusters could provide the additional acceleration needed to explain the observed high-energy CR spectrum. Here, we investigate this hypothesis through a laser-based experiment that creates magnetized plasma conditions similar to astrophysical environments. Our results demonstrate that interpenetrating collisionless shocks can significantly boost the energy of ambient protons previously energized by the individual shocks, while also improving the overall acceleration efficiency. Numerical kinetic simulations corroborate these findings, revealing that protons are reaccelerated via their bouncing motion in the convective electric fields of the colliding magnetized flows. By allowing to highly energize ambient protons, our novel colliding-shock platform opens the prospect to test the long-discussed mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration in a controlled laboratory setting.",

Our method projects galaxy Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) onto a two-dimensional map, identifying regions that are sparsely sampled by existing spectroscopic observations. These under-sampled areas are then augmented with simulated galaxies, yielding a more representative spectroscopic training dataset. To assess the efficacy of this SOM-based data augmentation in the context of the forthcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we employ mock galaxy catalogues from the OpenUniverse2024 project and generate synthetic datasets that mimic the expected photometric selections of LSST after one (Y1) and ten (Y10) years of observation. We construct 501 degraded realisations by sampling galaxy colours, magnitudes, redshifts and spectroscopic success rates, in order to emulate the compilation of a wide array of realistic spectroscopic surveys. Augmenting the degraded mock datasets with simulated galaxies from the independent CosmoDC2 catalogues has markedly improved the performance of our photometric redshift estimates compared to models lacking this augmentation, particularly for high-redshift galaxies ($z_\\mathrm{true} \\gtrsim 1.5$). This improvement is manifested in notably reduced systematic biases and a decrease in catastrophic failures by up to approximately a factor of 2, along with a reduction in information loss in the conditional density estimations. These results underscore the effectiveness of SOM-based augmentation in refining photometric redshift estimation, thereby enabling more robust analyses in cosmology and astrophysics for the NSF-DOE Vera C.

Frequency analyses of \\ktwo\\ and \\tess\\ time-series photometric data reveal the co-existence of rotational modulation and pulsation. We use the spectrum synthesis technique to determine fundamental parameters and chemical composition, which shows that all the three stars are likely to be chemically normal. The evolutionary status of the target stars corresponds to the main-sequence phases and places them within the $\\delta$ Scuti instability strip of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The line profile variability is observed in all three stars, especially intriguing in HD\\,68703 and a typical signature of the non-radial pulsation, demands further detailed examination. Using \\tess\\ photometry, we identified the radial modes of orders $n$=3 and 4 for HD\\,23734, $n$=1, 3, and 4 for HD\\,68703, and $n$=3,4 and 5 for HD\\,73345.

In particular, late-time tails and memory effects after the merger are two low-frequency phenomena, not detectable by current instruments, but which can be observed by future detectors. Their low-frequency nature could, in principle, make them more sensitive to larger-scale structures at galactic length scales. We show that indeed there are transient features, such as amplitude changes, in both tails and (linear) memory when the merger occurs while immersed in an astrophysical environment. For realistic galaxies, the environment's compactness is small enough that the effect is strongly suppressed, but these effects could become relevant for mergers occurring in regions with matter overdensities, like the ones recently observed numerically for wave dark matter. On the other hand, the memory (the difference between the amplitude asymptotically early and late) and asymptotically late decay are independent on the properties of the environment.",

When combined with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI and Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraints, these data imply a rapid reionization history ($z_\\mathrm{mid}=7.00^{+0.12}_{-0.18}$ and $\\Delta z_{50}=1.12^{+0.12}_{-0.29}$) and a value of $\\tau=0.0492^{+0.0014}_{-0.0030}$, which is largely insensitive to the assumed cosmological model and independent of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The optical depth can also be measured from large-scale $(\\ell30)$ CMB anisotropies, but the results are sensitive to the choice of cosmological model. Assuming $\\Lambda$CDM and combining small-scale CMB data with CMB lensing and type 1a supernovae (SNe) yields tight constraints that are compatible with the Ly$\\alpha$ bound. Adding galaxy clustering and lensing measurements brings the constraints further into agreement with the Ly$\\alpha$ bound. These independent results reinforce a consensus picture in which reionization is rapid and late. However, the combination of small-scale CMB, CMB lensing, and BAO data yields $\\tau=0.094\\pm0.011$, which is in $4\\sigma$ tension with our Ly$\\alpha$ bound.

High-speed photometry confirms persistent double-peaked variability consistent with cyclotron beaming, thus indicating the presence of a magnetic WD. Phase-resolved Keck/LRIS spectroscopy reveals strong hydrogen and helium emission lines but no donor features, indicating the accretor is a magnetic WD and the donor is hydrogen-rich, but cold and faint. The absence of a detectable donor and the low inferred temperature ($\\lesssim$ 3500 K) disfavor an evolved donor scenario. Instead, the short period and the system's halo-like kinematics suggest Gaia19bxc may be the first known metal-poor polar. Because metal-poor donors are more compact than solar-metallicity donors of the same mass, they can reach shorter minimum periods. Gaia19bxc is one of only a handful of known metal-poor CVs below the canonical period minimum and has the shortest period of any such magnetic system discovered to date.",

These scatterings could yield a flux of boosted dark matter particles directly detectable on Earth, which enhances the sensitivity of dark matter direct detection and neutrino experiments to light and inelastic dark matter models. Here we calculate the cosmic-ray boosted dark matter flux from the neutrino-emitting active galactic nuclei, NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056, by considering realistic cosmic-ray distributions, deep inelastic scatterings, and mass splittings in the dark sector. From this we derive novel bounds from these sources on light and/or inelastic dark matter models with Super-K and XENONnT. We find that cosmic-ray boosted dark matter from neutrino-emitting active galactic nuclei can test regions of parameter space favored to reproduce the observed relic abundance of dark matter in the Universe, and that are otherwise experimentally inaccessible.",

        "abstract": "We present a code that removes $\\sim 90\\%$ of the variance in astrometric measurements caused by atmospheric turbulence, by using Gaussian process regression (GPR) to interpolate the turbulence field from the positions of stars measured by Gaia to the positions of arbitrary targets. This enables robust and routine accuracy of 1-3 milliarcsec on bright sources in single exposures of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). For the kernel of the GPR, we use the anisotropic correlation function of the turbulent displacement field, as measured directly from the Gaia reference stars, which should yield optimal accuracy if the displacement field is Gaussian. We test the code on 26 simulated LSST exposures and 604 real DES exposures in varying conditions. The average correlation function of the astrometric errors for separations $<1^{\\prime}$ is used to estimate the variance of turbulence distortions. On average, for DES, the post-GPR variance is $\\sim 12 \\times$ smaller than the pre-GPR variance. Application of the GPR to LSST is hence equivalent, for brighter stars and asteroids, to having 12 Rubin observatories running simultaneously. The expected improvement in the RMS of turbulence displacement errors is the square root of this value, $\\sim 3.5.$ The post-GPR RMS displacement decreases with the density of reference stars as $\\sim n_\\star^{-0.5}$ for noiseless LSST simulations, and $\\sim n_\\star^{-0.3}$ for DES data.",

While most studies assume idealized vacuum backgrounds, realistic extreme-mass-ratio binaries are embedded in astrophysical environments, such as accretion disks, stellar clusters, or dark matter spikes, disks and halos, that can significantly alter the orbital dynamics. We explore bound geodesics around general-relativistic solutions describing rotating black holes surrounded by matter halos, for the first time, and map how environmental effects meddle with the spacetime symmetries of vacuum spinning (Kerr) black holes. In particular, we find that the loss of a Carter-like constant leads to geodesic non-integrability and the onset of chaos. This manifests through resonant island and chaotic layer formations around transient orbital resonances in phase space; features that are otherwise completely absent in integrable Kerr geodesics. Resonant islands, which are extended, non-zero volume regions in phase space, encapsulate periodic orbit points. Non-integrability ensures that the periodicity of the central resonant point is shared throughout the island's geodesics, thus effectively enhancing the lifespan of resonances, beyond Kerr-based predictions. Therefore, they can subject distinct imprint on gravitational-wave signals, with significant consequences for gravitational-wave modeling and parameter inference of astrophysical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.",

        "abstract": "Neutron stars are the most compact horizonless objects in the Universe, exhibiting the strongest known magnetic fields. They are potential sources of coincident gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation across the entire spectrum. However, the internal configuration of their magnetic fields and the mechanisms that stabilize them remain open questions. As a step forward in understanding the timescale for the emergence of magnetic instabilities that disrupt stellar field configurations, we study the impact of stellar rotation using three-dimensional general relativistic numerical simulations of uniformly rotating, isolated neutron stars threaded by strong, poloidal, pulsar-like magnetic fields. The initial stellar configurations assume perfect conductivity and are stationary and axisymmetric. We explore a range of angular velocities, from non-rotating stars to those near the mass-shedding limit. We find that the stars spontaneously develop differential rotation, which triggers the appearance of a strong toroidal magnetic field component. Non-rotating neutron stars are unstable to the Tayler and Parker instabilities, which significantly change the magnetic field geometry. These instabilities lead to a rapid reduction of the initial magnetic energy by $\\sim 99\\%$ within $\\sim 4$ Alfv\\'en times of their onset. In contrast, rotation significantly delays the development of these instabilities and, in some cases, mitigates their effects. Highly rotating models retain up to $\\sim 30\\%$ of their magnetic energy for at least $\\sim 10$ Alfv\\'en times. Our results suggest that rotation plays a crucial role in stabilizing the magnetic field of neutron stars, regardless of its initial configuration.",

Examples include the search for biosignatures through the detection of the oxygen A-band at 760 nm, and the study of atmospheric escape through the helium 1083 nm triplet. These applications align well with the capabilities of a spectrograph based on a Virtually Imaged Phased Array (VIPA), a high-throughput dispersive element that is essentially a modified Fabry-Perot etalon. We are developing VIPER, a high-resolution, narrowband, multimode fiber-fed VIPA spectrograph specifically designed to observe the helium 1083 nm triplet absorption line in the atmospheres of gaseous exoplanets. VIPER will achieve a resolving power of 300,000 over a wavelength range of 25 nm, and will be cross-dispersed by an echelle grating. VIPER is intended for operation on the 1.5 m Tillinghast Telescope and potentially on the 6.5 m MMT, both located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) on Mount Hopkins, Arizona, USA. In this paper, we present VIPER's instrument requirements, derived from the primary science goal of detecting anisotropic atmospheric escape from exoplanets. We discuss the design methodology for VIPA-based spectrographs aimed at maximizing throughput and diffraction efficiency, and we derive a wave-optics-based end-to-end model of the spectrograph to simulate the intensity distribution at the detector. We present an optical design for VIPER and highlight the potential of VIPA-based spectrographs for advancing exoplanetary science.",

        "abstract": "(abridged) Context: The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism to generate turbulence and transport angular momentum in protoplanetary discs. While most recent work has focused on adding more complex physics, the saturation properties of the instability in radially extended discs and its convergence as a function of resolution are still largely unknown. We tackle the question of VSI saturation and associated turbulence using radially extended fully 3D global disc models at very high resolution so as to capture both the largest VSI scales and the small-scale turbulent cascade. We use the GPU-accelerated code Idefix to achieve resolutions of up to 200 points per scale height in the 3 spatial directions, with a full 2pi azimuthal extent and disc aspect ratio H/R=0.1.   Results: We demonstrate that large-scale transport properties are converged with 100 points per scale height, leading to a Shakura-Sunyaev alpha=1.3e-3. Inner boundary condition artifacts propagate deep inside the computational domain, leading to reduced alpha in these regions. The large-scale corrugation wave zones identified in 2D models survive in 3D, albeit with less coherence. Our models show no sign of long-lived zonal flows, pressure bumps or vortices, in contrast to lower-resolution simulations. Finally, we show that the turbulent cascade resulting from VSI saturation can be interpreted in the framework of critically balanced rotating turbulence.   Conclusion: The VSI leads to vigorous turbulence in protoplanetary discs, associated with outward angular momentum transport but without any significant long-lived features that could enhance planet formation. The innermost regions of VSI simulations are always polluted by boundary-condition artifacts affecting the first VSI wave train, so radially extended domains should be used in a more systematic manner.",

The common strategy to solve the problem is to impose a shift symmetry on the K\\\"ahler potential, but this often leads to a negative potential in the large-field regime. To avoid negative potentials, an additional superfield called the stabiliser is usually added with a desired interaction. An alternative mechanism in supergravity, avoiding the use of a stabiliser superfield, was earlier proposed by two of us in the setup with a single chiral superfield having inflaton and goldstino amongst its field components. In this work, we extend that alternative mechanism to multi-superfield models of inflation, thereby providing a generic framework for embedding a wide class of single- and multi-field inflation models into supergravity. We illustrate our approach by several concrete examples of multi-field inflation and clarify the conditions required to avoid tachyonic instabilities during multi-field evolution.

MD$\\nu$DM'25 was the third such meeting, following the first in October of 2022 held at the IFPU in Trieste, Italy and the second in January of 2024 hosted by the Center for Neutrino Physics at Virginia Tech in Arlington, USA. Mineral detectors record and retain damage induced by nuclear recoils in synthetic or natural mineral samples. The damage features can then be read out by a variety of nano- and micro-scale imaging techniques. Applications of mineral detectors on timescales relevant for laboratory experiments include reactor neutrino monitoring and dark matter detection, with the potential to measure the directions as well as the energies of the induced nuclear recoils. For natural mineral detectors which record nuclear recoils over geological timescales, reading out even small mineral samples could be sensitive to rare interactions induced by astrophysical neutrinos, cosmic rays, dark matter and heavy exotic particles. A series of mineral detectors of different ages could measure the time evolution of these fluxes, offering a unique window into the history of our solar system and the Milky Way.

        "abstract": "Galactic disks typically exhibit a negative radial metallicity gradient, indicating faster enrichment in the inner regions. Recent studies report that this gradient becomes flatter with increasing stellar age in the Milky Way's (MW) thin disk, while the thick disk exhibits a mildly positive gradient across all ages. In this work, we revisit the metallicity gradient-age relation (MGAR) in both the thin and thick disks of the MW. We use spectroscopic data from LAMOST DR8 and stellar ages calibrated with asteroseismology. Our results show a steadily flattening MGAR in the thin disk and confirm a positive gradient $\\sim0.013\\,\\mathrm{dex\\,kpc^{-1}}$ in the thick disk. The flattening in the thin disk may be caused by large-scale radial migration induced by transient spiral arms, or by a time-dependent steepening of the interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity gradient as suggested by recent FIRE2 simulations. The positive gradient in the thick disk may reflect early enrichment of the outer regions by strong feedback or starburst-driven outflows in a turbulent, gas-rich proto-disk. These findings suggest distinct chemodynamical evolution paths for the MW's thin and thick disks and provide valuable constraints for future models of Galactic chemical evolution.",

The new data have sufficient angular resolution to exclude compact sources and enable us to trace the faint extended emission from the relic lobe to a remarkable distance of 820 kpc from the cluster center. The new images reveal intricate spatial structure within the fossil lobe, including narrow (5-10 kpc), long (70-100 kpc) radio filaments embedded within the diffuse emission at the bottom of the lobe. The filaments exhibit a very steep spectrum ($S_\\nu\\propto \\nu^{-\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha \\sim 3$), significantly steeper than the ambient synchrotron emission from the lobe ($\\alpha \\sim 1.5-2$); they mostly disappear in recently-published MeerKAT images at 1.28 GHz. Their origin is unclear; similar features observed in some other radio lobes typically have a spectrum flatter than that of their ambient medium. These radio filaments may trace regions where the magnetic field has been stretched and amplified by gas circulation within the rising bubble. The spectrum of the brightest region of the radio lobe exhibits a spectral break, which corresponds to a radiative cooling age of the fossil lobe of approximately 174 Myr, giving a date for this most powerful AGN explosion.",

        "abstract": "Polluted white dwarfs offer a unique way to directly probe the compositions of exoplanetary bodies. We examine the water content of accreted material using the oxygen abundances of 51 highly polluted white dwarfs. Within this sample, we present new abundances for three H-dominated atmosphere white dwarfs that showed promise for accreting water-rich material. Throughout, we explore the impact of the observed phase and lifetime of accretion disks on the inferred elemental abundances of the parent bodies that pollute each white dwarf. Our results indicate that white dwarfs sample a range of dry to water-rich material, with median uncertainties in water mass fractions of $\\approx$15\\%. Amongst the He-dominated white dwarfs, 35/39 water abundances are consistent with corresponding H abundances. While for any individual white dwarf it may be ambiguous as to whether or not water is present in the accreted parent body, when considered as a population the prevalence of water-rich bodies is statistically robust. The population as a whole has a median water mass fraction of $\\approx$25\\%, and enforcing chondritic parent body compositions, we find that 31/51 WDs are likely to have non-zero water concentrations. This conclusion is different from a similar previous analysis of white dwarf pollution and we discuss reasons why this might be the case. Pollution in H-dominated white dwarfs continues to be more water-poor than in their He-dominated cousins, although the sample size of H-dominated white dwarfs remains small and the two samples still suffer a disjunction in the range of host star temperatures being probed.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, modifications to General Relativity (GR) have been explored to address cosmological observations, particularly in the context of late-time cosmic acceleration. Among these, modifications based on the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR), particularly $f(T)$ gravity, have gained significant attention. In this work, we investigate the scalar perturbations in $f(T)$ gravity, focusing on how these perturbations modify the Poisson and lensing equations and how they impact cosmological observables. By incorporating observational data from cosmic chromatometers, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the DESI BAO survey, and Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), we derive constraints on the parameters of the $f(T)$ power-law model. Our results suggest that $f(T)$ gravity can effectively alleviate some of the tensions observed in the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model, including the Hubble constant ($H_0$) discrepancy. Furthermore, the evolution of the supernova luminosity and its dependence on the gravitational constant are considered to refine the measurement of cosmological parameters. The model's ability to address the $H_0$ tension is critically examined, and we find that $f(T)$ gravity offers a viable alternative to the standard model. The work concludes by comparing the fits of the $f(T)$ gravity model to the $\\Lambda$CDM model using various information criteria, revealing key insights into the viability of modified gravity in contemporary cosmology.",

In such systems, an intrabinary shock can form between the pulsar and the companion winds, serving as a site for particle acceleration and associated non-thermal emission. Assuming that protons can be extracted from the neutron star surface and accelerated at the intrabinary shock and/or within the pulsar wind, we model the very high-energy gamma-ray and neutrino emissions ($0.1-10^3$~TeV) produced through interactions with the companion wind and the companion star. We first calculate the high-energy emissions using an optimistic combination of parameters to maximize the gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes. We find that, for energetic spider pulsars with a spin-down power $\\gtrsim 10^{35}\\rm erg\\, s^{-1}$ and a magnetic field of $\\sim 10^{3}\\, \\rm G$ in the companion region, the gamma-ray emission could be detectable as point sources by CTA and LHAASO, while the neutrino emission could be detectable by the future TRIDENT detector. Finally, we build a synthetic population of these systems, compute the cumulative neutrino flux expected from spider pulsars, and compare it with the Galactic neutrino diffuse emission measured by IceCube. We find that, under realistic assumptions on the fraction of the spin-down power converted into protons, the contribution of spiders to the diffuse Galactic neutrino flux is negligible.",

Low-ionization structures (LISs), found in all morphological types of planetary nebulae (PNe), are small-scale features prominent in emission from low-ionization species such as [N ii], [S ii], [O ii] and [O i]. Observational and theoretical efforts have aimed to better understand their origin and nature. Recently, the detection of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) emission associated with LISs in a few PNe has added a new piece to the puzzle of understanding these nebular structures. Aims. Although observational studies indicate that LISs are characterized by lower electron densities than their host PNe, model predictions suggest higher total densities in these structures. The detection of H$_2$ emission from LISs in more PNe could help reconcile the observations with model predictions. Methods. Observations of five PNe with already known LISs were conducted using the Near InfraRed Imager and Spectrometer (NIRI) mounted on the 8 m Gemini North telescope. A narrow band filter, centered on H$_2$ 1-0 2.122 ${\\mu}$m emission line, was used along with a continuum filter, to ensure continuum subtraction. Results. We present a deep, high-angular resolution near-IR narrowband H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) imaging survey of five Galactic PNe with LISs. We nearly double the sample of LISs detected in the H$_2$ 1-0 2.122 ${\\mu}$m emission line as well as the number of host PNe. These findings allows us to prove that the systematically lower electron density in LISs --relative to the rims and shells of their host nebulae-- is linked to the presence of H2 molecular gas. Additionally, we provide the first estimation of the excited H$_2$ molecular mass in LISs, which is found between 200 and 5000 times lower than the corresponding ionized gas mass.",

We carry out pebble-driven core accretion planet formation modelling with focus on the impact of pre-main sequence stellar luminosity evolution on giant planet formation around host stars in the range of $1{-}2.4\\ \\rm M_{\\odot}$. We find that giant planet formation is sensitive to the evolution of stellar luminosity, specifically the locations and times at which giant planet formation can occur depend on it. High stellar luminosity causes an increase in the scale height of the gas and pebbles, which may decrease the efficiency of pebble accretion, making it more challenging to form giant planets. This has important consequences for the composition of these giant planets, stressing the need to incorporate such aspects into planet formation models.",

        "abstract": "Radio emissions from RS CVn objects exhibit distinct characteristics at low and high frequencies, widely attributed to differing radiation mechanisms. The disparate processes of high-frequency gyrosynchrotron and low-frequency electron cyclotron maser emissions have traditionally suggested an absence of correlation in their radio luminosities. Our study presents a frequency-independent linear correlation between radio luminosity ($L_R$) and orbital/rotational periods ($P$) in RS CVn binaries. Analyzing the Sydney Radio Star Catalogue (SRSC) data, we derived orbital periods for 42 of 60 RS CVn sources using TESS light curves, revealing a strong positive correlation (PCC = 0.698, $P$ = 3.95e-7) between $\\log_{10}L_R$ and $\\log_{10}P$. This correlation remains across frequencies from 144-3000 MHz, showing uniform luminosity behavior. By combining light curve analysis with stellar mass-radius-luminosity relationships, we calculated parameters like binary mass, primary/secondary mass, Rossby number, and binary separation for eight RS CVn systems. The results show a notable correlation between radio luminosity and binary mass, primary mass, and separation (PCC = 0.663, 0.663, 0.719), with separation showing the strongest correlation. This suggests the radio emission may largely originate from the binary components' interaction, challenging existing models of RS CVn radio emission mechanisms and offering insights into the individual versus collective origins of these emissions.",

In addition, the combined data has placed uncomfortably strong constraints on neutrino mass. Both effects can be interpreted as negative neutrino mass, one describing the change to the expansion history and the other one describing enhanced lensing. In this paper, we show the current tensions can be solved with a single change either to the lensing of the CMB or the expansion of the universe. We show additional lensing could arise from a variety of models with new light fields. However, these models rarely give the same signal in temperature and polarization, giving a concrete test of the scenario. Alternatively, dark sector models can explain the changes to the expansion by changing the evolution of the matter density. These models introduce new forces, giving rise to long range signals in the three-point statistics of galaxies. We discuss a range of other examples which all illustrate the pattern that additional signals should appear if these tensions are explained by beyond the Standard Model physics.",

Counting near horizon quasinormal modes shows that a modest quadrupolar deformation self-regularizes the ultraviolet divergence: the entropy of Hawking radiation is finite for any non-vanishing quadrupole, without an ad hoc cutoff. Matching this canonical entropy to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy leads to no-hair violating multipoles, at percent-to-tens-of-percent level, and provides concrete observational targets for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).",

Our results suggest that the second-order tails of curvature perturbations with multipole numbers $l\\geq4$ decay as $t^{-2l-2}$ at fixed spatial position and $u^{-l-3}$ in retarded-time $u$ at null infinity, slower than their linear counterparts, which can play a role in multi-messenger observations.",

        "abstract": "The unambiguous detection of magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI) via radio observations would provide a novel method for detecting exoplanets and probing their magnetic fields. Although direct radio detection of sub-Jovian planets is hindered by the low frequencies involved, models of sub-Alfv\\'enic SPI predict that Earth-like planets in close-in orbits around M dwarfs may induce detectable emission. Here, we revisit the modelling of the expected radio emission from magnetic star-planet interaction in the iconic M-dwarf systems Proxima Centauri, YZ Ceti, and GJ 1151, where claims of SPI-related radio detections have been made. For this, we use SIRIO (Star-planet Interaction and Radio Induced Observations), a public Python code that models radio emission from sub-Alfv\\'enic SPI. We benchmark SIRIO results against those paradigmatic systems, whose SPI modeling has been previously discussed in the literature. Our results support previous findings that Proxima b, YZ Cet b, and the putative planet GJ 1151 b are most likely in the sub-Alfv\\'enic regime (assuming a hybrid PFSS geometry), so SPI should be at work in all of them. We find that the Alfv\\'en wing model generally predicts a very low level of radio emission, while if magnetic reconnection takes place, prospects for detection are significantly better. We also find that free-free absorption may play a relevant role, in particular in YZ Ceti. Our SIRIO code can also be used to evaluate the feasibility of radio proposals aimed at detecting SPI, and to constrain the stellar wind mass-loss rate or planetary magnetic field.",

However, with the precision and accumulated statistics of the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array, in combination with advancements in theory and modeling - e.g. of the Galactic magnetic field - it is now possible to set solid constraints on the sources of UHECRs. The spectrum and composition measurements above the ankle can be well described by a population of extragalactic, homogeneously distributed sources emitting mostly intermediate-mass nuclei. Using additionally the observed anisotropy in the arrival directions, namely the large-scale dipole >8 EeV as well as smaller-scale warmspots at higher energies, even more powerful constraints on the density and distribution of sources can be placed. Yet, open questions remain - like the striking similarity of the sources that is necessary to describe the rather pure mass composition above the ankle, or the origin of the highest energy events whose tracked back directions point towards voids. The current findings and possible interpretation of UHECR data will be presented in this review.",

Recent observations by the X-ray polarimeter IXPE support the presence of turbulence, with varying conditions even in different regions of a same source. We aim at modeling such synchrotron emission, and in particular the degree of linear polarization, by using for the first time 3D relativistic MHD turbulence simulations. Thanks to a novel accelerated version of the ECHO code, a series of 3D relativistic MHD simulations are performed assuming a relativistically hot plasma and various degrees of magnetization, mimicking different conditions encountered in synchrotron sources. Magnetic fluctuations at random directions with respect to a background field are initialized at large scales. After the turbulent cascade is fully developed, the statistical properties of the plasma and of the synthetic synchrotron emission maps are analyzed. Turbulence rapidly relaxes to a sort of Alfv\\'enic equilibrium and a Kolmogorov cascade with slope -5/3 soon develops, with differences depending on the initial ratio $\\eta$ of magnetic fluctuations over the background field. Dissipation mostly occurs in thin current sheets, where (numerical) reconnection takes place, intermittency and deviation from isotropic Gaussian distributions are observed. Synthetic synchrotron maps and their statistical properties depend on $\\eta$ too, approaching analytical estimates for large $\\eta$. The integrated degree of linear polarization is found to cover the whole range of observed values in PWNe, and its dependence on the relative amplitude of turbulent fluctuations shows a good agreement with analytical estimates, even in the presence of anisotropy.",

It includes the reduced effective optical properties of porous ices and the additional wave extinction due to scattering on pores. The model is applied to analyze the measured THz$-$IR response of CO and CO$_2$ laboratory ices and to estimate their scattering properties and porosity.   $Methods.$ Our model combines the Bruggeman effective medium theory, the Lorentz-Mie and Rayleigh scattering theories, and the radiative transfer theory to analyze the measured THz$-$IR optical properties of laboratory ices.   $Results.$ We apply this model to show that the electromagnetic-wave scattering in studied laboratory ices occurs mainly in the Rayleigh regime at frequencies below 32 THz. We conclude that pores of different shapes and dimensions can be approximated by spheres of effective radius. By comparing the measured broadband response of our laboratory ices with those of reportedly compact ices from earlier studies, we quantify the scattering properties of our CO and CO$_2$ ice samples. Their porosity is shown to be as high as 15% and 22%, respectively. Underestimating the ice porosity in the data analysis leads to a proportional relative underestimate of the THz$-$IR optical constants.   $Conclusions.$ The scattering properties and porosity of ices have to be quantified along with their THz$-$IR response in order to adequately interpret astrophysical observations.",

Next, we searched for every observed star the nearest synthetic spectrum using a four-parameter representation - effective temperature, gravity, [Fe/H], and a range of interstellar absorption values. However, rms deviations of observed spectra from synthetic ones appeared to be not sufficient to claim that any of the stars is a binary.

We also utilized a compilation of redshift space distortions ($f \\sigma_8$) dataset to constrain the growth of structures in each of the models modulated by the effective gravitational coupling. We find that our extended Logarithmic $f(Q)$ models are well-constrained by the current cosmological data and are able to describe the late-time cosmic acceleration. The inverse Logarithmic model we introduce is also able to accommodate a phantom-like dark energy equation of state at late times, which is consistent with the recent DESI DR2 observations. We report explicitly predictions for the effective gravitational coupling ($\\mu$), and the amplitude damping parameter of gravitational wave ($\\nu$) solely based on the background data, which can be tested against future observations.

Among them, a superoutburst is observed in CRTS J110014.7+131552 which is associated with the precursor outburst, where prominent superhumps are observed during maximum of the outburst with a mean period of 0.06786(1) d. We have observed variations in the superhump period, along with changes in the shape of the light curve profile and the amplitude of the superhumps during different phases of the outburst, indicating disc-radius variation as well as periodically variable dissipation at the accretion stream's bright spot. The data on SDSS J093537.46+161950.8 reveal previously unknown variations modulated with periods 0.06584(2) d and 2.36(2) d, related to the positive superhump and the disc-precession periods, respectively, which can reasonably be interpreted as a result of the prograde rotation of an eccentric accretion disc. Despite its short orbital period, the lack of outburst activity, along with its stable long-term brightness, discovery spectrum, and absolute magnitude suggests that the object might not be an SU UMa type dwarf nova. Instead, it may belong to the group of high mass-transfer CVs below the period gap, either to a rare class of nova-like variables or to the class of high-luminosity IPs, a subclass of magnetic CVs. For [PK2008] HalphaJ130559, a new average orbital period of 0.15092(1) d has been identified. Additionally, this system displays previously undetected average periods of 0.14517(3) d and 3.83(1) d, which can be provisionally identified as negative superhump and disc-precession periods, respectively. If the identified simultaneous signals do indeed reflect negative superhump and disc-precession period variations then their origin may be associated with the retrograde precession of a tilted disc and its interaction with the secondary stream.",

However, the observed redshift distribution in a large sample of 1.3 million quasars shows a significant dipole anisotropy. A peculiar motion of the observer could introduce such a dipole anisotropy in the observed redshift distribution. However, the motion inferred therefrom turns out to be not only many times the peculiar motion estimated from the anisotropy in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), but also nearly in a direction at a right angle. The Solar peculiar motion, in fact, turns out to be, quite unexpectedly, in the direction of the Galactic Centre. Such a statistically significant discrepancy in peculiar motion, derived by different methodologies, could imply a violation of the cosmological principle, a cornerstone in the foundation of the standard model.",

The outer Solar System is believed to host a vast reservoir of long-period comets (LPCs), but our understanding of their spatial distribution and dynamical history remains limited due to observational biases and uncertainties in orbital solutions for really observed comets. Aims. We aim to provide a comprehensive and dynamically homogeneous orbital database of LPCs to support the study of their origin, evolution, dynamical status, and 6D distribution of orbital elements. Methods. We updated the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits and their Dynamical Evolution (CODE catalogue) by computing original and future barycentric orbits, orbital parameters at previous and next perihelion, using full Monte Carlo swarms of real comets for the uncertainties estimation and taking into account the planetary, Galactic and passing stars perturbations according to the latest data and algorithms. Results. This update of the CODE catalogue focuses on the dynamical status of near-parabolic comets. Using current stellar data, we formulate new constraints for dynamically new comets. Now, the CODE database includes 983 orbital solutions for 369 comets with full uncertainty estimates and dynamical classifications, covering nearly all comets with original semi-major axes exceeding 10,000 au and discovered before 2022, as well as all LPCs discovered beyond 10 au from the Sun during during this period, and over 80% of the known LPCs with perihelion distances beyond 7 au.",

Each event is modeled with an exponential rise/decay profile, and spectral variability is quantified via a constant fit. From 679 high-quality GRBBLs, I apply extreme deconvolution for unsupervised classification. The GRBBL population is remarkably homogeneous; the most robust split is in achromatic vs. chromatic events, with significant overlap. Removing spectral information yields a luminosity-driven classification in type-1 and type-2 GRBBLs, although this classification is not identified in all tests. This study establishes GRBBL population studies as a tool to study blazars. As a by-product of this project I identify a correlation between peak luminosity and timescales in GRBBLs.",

It avoids the operation of subtracting a large magnetic energy from the total energy to obtain a very small thermal pressure in low-beta regions, thereby improving the numerical stability of MHD models. We implemented this method in COCONUT and validated the model by performing a time-evolving coronal simulation during Carrington Rotation (CR) 2296, a solar maximum CR. We also compare quasi-steady-state simulation results during the solar minimum and the increasing phase, calculated using both versions of COCONUT adopting the decomposed energy equation and the traditional full energy equation to further validate the reliability of the energy decomposition method. The simulation results show that the energy decomposition method yields results nearly identical to those of the traditional full energy equation during solar minimum, while significantly enhancing COCONUT's ability to simulate coronal evolution under strong magnetic fields, even those exceeding 100 Gauss. This method is well suited for performing quasi-realistic time-evolving coronal simulations around solar maxima without excessively filtering out the observed strong magnetic fields.",

The flares had a duration on the order of only ten minutes each, and within seconds reached a 1-100 keV peak luminosity of $1.1-2.6\\times10^{38}$ erg/s. The associated INTEGRAL/IBIS count rate was about ${\\sim}$10x higher than usual for the hard state. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such strong flaring has been seen in Cyg X-1, despite the more than 21 years of INTEGRAL monitoring, with almost ${\\sim}$20 Ms of exposure, and the similarly deep monitoring with RXTE/PCA that lasted from 1997 to 2012. The flares were seen in all three X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray instruments of INTEGRAL. Radio monitoring by the AMI Large Array with observations 6 h before and 40 h after the X-ray flares did not detect a corresponding increase in radio flux. The shape of the X-ray spectrum shows only marginal change during the flares, i.e., photon index and cut-off energy are largely preserved. The overall flaring behavior points toward a sudden and brief release of energy, either due to the ejection of material in an unstable jet or due to the interaction of the jet with the ambient clumpy stellar wind.",

The moral of the story is simple: Chemical equilibrium governs numbers, kinetic equilibrium governs shapes. In an expanding Universe the operators that control them rarely fade at the same time, and when they do not, the order of decoupling is model dependent. Turning to phase-space evolution whenever momentum selectivity matters is the surest way to obtain robust cosmological predictions.",

        "abstract": "In order to understand solar atmospheric heating it is important to test heating models against spatially resolved data from solar active regions. Here we model a small active region, AR~12760 observed on 2020 April 28, with the GX Simulator package by fitting the EUV intensities in wavebands observed by Solar Dynamics Observatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. We assume the temporally and spatially averaged heating rate along a loop has a power-law dependence on loop length, $L$ and average magnetic field strength along the loop, $B_{avg}$. We find that the best fit heating model for the 211~\\AA\\ band is $\\approx 7\\times 10^{-3} (B_{avg}/{100 \\mbox{G}})^{1.5}(L/{10^9\\mbox{cm}})^{-1}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ but that there is a range of parameters that give qualitatively reasonable fits, which we conclude is due to a correlation between $B_{avg}$ and $L$. In addition, we find that the models of the bands including cooler emission (131 and 171~\\AA) greatly underestimate the extent of the emission in the legs of the longer loops at the peripheries of the active region that are the strongest contributors of the emission in those bands. We conclude that this is because the modeling assumes that all transition region emission is confined to the loop foot points, but in reality the upper transition region of longer loops extends significantly farther into the loop. It is important to consider this aspect of the transition region in future efforts to model EUV emission.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, fast solar wind is considered to originate in solar source regions that are continuously open to the heliosphere and slow wind originates in regions that are intermittently open to it. In fast wind, the gradient of the solar wind helium abundance ($A_\\mathrm{He}$) with increasing solar wind speed ($v_\\mathrm{sw}$) is $\\sim0$ and $A_\\mathrm{He}$ is fixed at $\\sim50\\%$ of the photospheric value. In slow wind, this gradient is large, $A_\\mathrm{He}$ is highly variable, and it doesn't exceed this $\\sim50\\%$ value. Although the normalized cross helicity in fast wind typically approaches 1, this is not universally true and Alterman & D'Amicis (2025) show that $\\nabla_{v_\\mathrm{sw}} \\! A_\\mathrm{He}$ in fast wind unexpectedly increases with decreasing $\\left|\\sigma_c\\right|$. We show that these large gradients are due to the presence of compressive fluctuations. Accounting for the solar wind's compressibility ($\\left|\\delta n/n\\right|$), there are two subsets of enhanced $A_\\mathrm{He}$ in excess of typical fast wind values. The subset with a large compressibility is likely from neither continuously nor intermittently open sources. The portion of the solar wind speed distribution over which these fluctuations are most significant corresponds to the range of Alfv\\'en wave-poor solar wind from continuously open source regions, which is likely analogous to the Alfv\\'enic slow wind. Mapping the results of this work to Alterman & D'Amicis (2025) and vice versa shows that, in any given $\\left|\\delta n/n\\right|$ quantile, $\\left|\\sigma_c\\right| \\lesssim 0.65$, an upper bound on non-Alfv\\'enic cross helicity. Similarly, $\\left|\\delta n/n\\right| \\lesssim 0.15$ in any given $\\left|\\sigma_c\\right|$ quantile, is an upper bound on incompressible fluctuations.

        "abstract": "TianQin is a proposed space-based gravitational wave detector mission that employs inter-satellite laser interferometry. Suppressing measurement noise and achieving high sensitivity require accurate alignment of multiple onboard interferometers after laser link acquisition. However, due to huge armlengths and varying point-ahead angles, the fine alignment of the transmitted beams can be particularly challenging, which needs to take into account both received laser power and far-field wavefront errors. To tackle this issue for TianQin which has small point-ahead angle variations, we propose an efficient alignment strategy that relies on finding the maximum-intensity direction of the transmitted beam as the alignment reference. The direction can be estimated through a quatrefoil scan of the local transmitted beam and the corresponding intensity measurement from the remote satellite. Under TianQin's fixed-value compensation of the point-ahead angles, simulation results reveal that the proposed strategy is capable of aligning the transmitted beams within 20 nrad from the mean value of the point-ahead angles, while the tilt-to-length coupling associated with far-field wavefront error can meet the requirement given a transmitted beam aberration of $\\lambda/40$ RMS.",

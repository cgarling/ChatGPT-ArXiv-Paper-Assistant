        "title": "The cosmological lithium problem",
        "abstract": "The discrepancy between the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed lithium abundance in Spite plateau stars has been attributed either to a challenge to the standard model of nucleosynthesis or to stellar processes occurring after the stars formed. To understand the origin of this discrepancy, it is crucial to link the cosmic star formation rate with a chemical enrichment model that incorporates the yields of both Population (Pop) III and II stars. It is within this framework that the evolution of lithium can be determined. The primary goal is to demonstrate that there is no discrepancy between the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed lithium abundance. By combining a standard chemical evolution model with the hierarchical structure formation scenario, it is possible to determine the lithium abundance as a function of $[\\mathrm{Fe/H}]$. The model's results are compared with observational data, including two extremely iron-poor stars: J0023+0307 and SMSS J0313-6708. The Spite plateau is naturally established in the range $-8.0 \\lesssim [\\mathrm{Fe/H}] \\lesssim -2.0$ with $^{7}\\mathrm{Li/H}$ $\\sim 1.81 \\times 10^{-10}$. We find that J0023+0307 could have formed $\\sim 4.4 \\times 10^{5} - 1.3 \\times 10^{6}$ years after the explosion of the first Pop III star in the Universe, whereas for SMSS J0313-6708 this event would have occurred $\\sim 2.2 \\times 10^{5} - 4.4 \\times 10^{5}$ years later. The Spite plateau serves as an observational signature of the formation of Pop III stars. The abundances observed in J0023+0307 and SMSS J0313-6708 are consistent with Pop III progenitor stars in the mass range $10-100 M_{\\odot}$. However, if some high-redshift star formation occurs within subhalo-like structures, the contribution of stars in the mass range $140-260 M_{\\odot}$ to the formation of the extended Spite plateau cannot be ruled out.",

Its proximity enables a detailed study of highly ionized gas that can be interpreted in the context of newly discovered high-redshift dwarf galaxies. We derive aperture spectra centered on eleven regions of interest; the spectra show very low extinction, A_V $\\lesssim 0.1$, consistent with optical determinations. The gas is highly ionized; we have detected 10 fine-structure lines, including [OIV] 25.9 micron with an ionization potential (IP) of $\\sim$ 55 eV, and [NeV] 14.3 micron with an IP of $\\sim$ 97 eV. The ionization state of IZw18 falls at the extreme upper end of all of the line ratios we analyzed, but not coincident with galaxies containing an accreting massive black hole (active galactic nucleus). Comparison of the line ratios with state-of-the-art photoionization and shock models suggests that the high ionization state in IZw18 is not due to shocks. Rather it can be attributed to metal-poor stellar populations with a self-consistent contribution of X-ray binaries or ultra-luminous X-ray sources. It could also be partially due to a small number of hot low-metallicity Wolf-Rayet stars ionizing the gas; a small fraction (a few percent) of the ionization could come from an intermediate-mass black hole. Our spectroscopy also revealed four 14 micron continuum sources, $\\gtrsim 30-100$ pc in diameter, three of which were not previously identified.

        "abstract": "Extremely metal-poor (XMP) galaxies are systems with gas-phase oxygen abundances below $\\sim$5% Solar metallicity (12+log(O/H)$\\le$7.35). These galaxies populate the metal-poor end of the mass-metallicity and luminosity-metallicity relations (MZR and LZR, respectively). Recent studies have found XMP galaxies in the nearby Universe to be outliers on the LZR, where they show enhanced luminosities relative to other galaxies of similar gas-phase oxygen abundance. Here, we present a study of the recently discovered XMP galaxy Leonessa and characterize the system's properties using new imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope and spectra from the Green Bank Telescope and Hobby-Eberly Telescope. We use these observations to measure a tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distance (15.86$\\pm$0.78 Mpc) to Leonessa, the HI gas mass, the gas-phase oxygen abundance, and N/O ratio. We find Leonessa is an isolated, gas rich (gas fraction $\\mu$=0.69), low-mass (log(M$_\\star$/M$_\\odot$)=6.12$\\pm$0.08), XMP (12+log(O/H)=7.32$\\pm$0.04), star-forming galaxy at a distance of 15.86$\\pm$0.78 Mpc. Our measurements show that Leonessa agrees with the MZR, but disagrees with the LZR; we conclude the LZR offset is due to recent star formation enhancing the system's luminosity. To investigate possible chemical evolution pathways for nearby XMP galaxies we also compile a comparison sample of 150 dwarf galaxies (53 XMP systems) taken from the literature with gas-phase metallicity measurements based on the direct method. We find evidence for an anti-correlation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and HI gas-to-stellar mass ratios. We posit Leonessa is undergoing a chemical evolution pathway typical of field dwarf galaxies.",

S-type AGB stars are an important constraint on this uncertainty as they have C/O ratios between 0.5 and 1, meaning they have only experienced up to a few episodes of TDU. AGB stars are also long-period variable stars, pulsating in low order radial pulsation modes. In this paper we estimate the initial masses of a large literature sample of intrinsic S-type AGB stars, by analysing their visual light curves, estimating their luminosities with Gaia DR3 parallax distances and finally comparing to a grid of detailed stellar models combined with linear pulsation models. We find that the initial mass distribution of intrinsic S-type stars peaks at 1.3 to 1.4 \\Msun, depending on model assumptions. There also appear to be stars with initial masses down to 1 solar mass, which is in conflict with current detailed stellar models. Additionally, we find that though the mass estimates for semiregular variable stars pulsating in higher order radial modes are precise, the Mira variables pulsating in the fundamental mode present challenges observationally from uncertain parallax distances, and theoretically from the onset of increased mass-loss and the necessity of non-linear pulsation models.",

The solver is integrated into the DISPATCH framework, which organises the computational domain into a collection of asynchronously updated patches. To reduce GPU kernel launch overhead, patches are grouped into \"bunches\" that are updated collectively. While porting the particular solver required a complete code refactoring, it yielded performance gains on both GPU and CPU. A stand-alone mini-app achieved a 7.3x speed-up compared to a single NVIDIA A100 GPU to seven AMD 7F72 Rome CPU cores. Within the full DISPATCH framework, the GPU-accelerated MHD Bunch solver showed excellent agreement with the CPU-based reference implementation on standard test problems such as the Sod shock tube and Orszag-Tang vortex. In large-scale 3D tests, the GPU implementation achieved a 9.8x overall speedup, comparing one GPU to 12 CPU cores, with the core MHD update routine being two orders of magnitude faster on the GPU than on a single CPU core. These results demonstrate that OpenMP offloading can provide substantial performance improvements for astrophysical codes while maintaining portability and accuracy. The work also demonstrates how new codes should be structured to allow simple and efficient directive-based GPU offloading.",

We explore both Galactic/near Galactic scenarios, including runaway or circumgalactic supernova remnants (SNRs) and parentless pulsar-wind nebulae (PWNe), and extragalactic scenarios including radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs), dying radio galaxies, galaxy clusters, galaxy pairs or groups, head-tail radio galaxies, and Odd Radio Circles (ORCs), as well as the possibility that the morphology is due to a chance alignment.

For the first time in a numerical simulation, we derive Faraday rotation measure maps (RM maps) from model cluster atmospheres based upon the universal pressure profile (UPP), incorporating a temperature profile for a 'typical' self-similar atmosphere described by only one parameter: M500. We compare our simulated polarization products with current observational data from Very Large Array (VLA) and LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR), as well as continuing investigations from our previous work, such as the detectability of the Laing Garrington effect. We also studied the variation of mean fractional polarization with cluster mass and jet power. We produce simulated Stokes Q and U channel images and using the Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis technique we create RM maps. These data provide insight into what we should expect of current and future high-resolution polarimetric studies of active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows as we were able to probe the limitations of the RM synthesis technique by comparing it with the RM map direct from our simulations. Highlights of our study include clear reproduction of polarization enhancements towards the edges of radio lobes for suitable conditions and a demonstration that complex lobe morphologies with multiple emission and Faraday active regions interspersed as might be expected in some pole-on or perhaps precessing sources should be distinguishable in observations with current technology. Given that the UPP is our most representative general cluster atmosphere, these numerical simulations, and the polarimetric properties derived from them, represent the most realistic yet for spherically symmetric atmospheres.",

        "abstract": "Detecting Population III (Pop. III) stars remains a major observational challenge. Their Balmer series recombination line emission, redshifted into the infrared at $z \\sim 5-11$, is a potential tracer. JWST/NIRSpec offers the first opportunity to detect such lines, provided fluxes exceed instrumental sensitivity. This study aims to model the expected luminosities of the first four Balmer series transitions from Pop. III star-forming halos and assess their detectability with JWST/NIRSpec across $5 \\leq z \\leq 11$. We use the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH with merger trees constructed from the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism and cosmological N-body simulations targeting Milky Way-like halos and the halo population in a 8~Mpc$/h$ box. Predicted fluxes are compared to JWST detection limits derived from the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) assuming a 10,000 s NIRSpec exposure at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5. For our default model parameters, Pop. III H$\\alpha$ fluxes peak at $\\sim10^{-21}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, 2-3 orders of magnitude below the JWST detection threshold ($\\sim6 \\times 10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). The fluxes in the other Balmer series lines are weaker than H$\\alpha$ and hence are also not detectable. Among the model parameters that we explore, the ionizing photon escape fraction $f_{\\mathrm{esc,III}}$ has the strongest effect on Pop. III Balmer series fluxes when changed: reducing $f_\\mathrm{esc,III}$ from 0.9 to 0.1 increases the fluxes by $\\gtrsim$1 order of magnitude. However, even in this case, the lines remain undetectable.   Balmer series lines powered by emission from Pop. III stars will be undetectable by JWST without strong lensing ($\\mu \\gtrsim 10$). A-SLOTH provides a useful tool to predict emission strengths and assess the detectability of Pop. III stars across cosmic history.",

        "abstract": "Predictions from current theories and simulations suggest that dual AGN systems are exceedingly rare at high redshifts. The intense radiation and powerful outflows from AGNs regulate star formation, heat the interstellar medium, and drive massive gas outflows that shape the host galaxy and its surroundings. One manifestation of AGN feedback is the creation of extended Ly$\\alpha$ nebulae. However, identifying these systems at high-$z$ is challenging. Here, we report a remarkable dual AGN candidate at $z \\sim 5.4$ using JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec, with a separation of $\\sim1.7$ arcseconds ($\\sim10.4$ pkpc). This is one of the highest spectroscopically confirmed redshift dual AGNs discovered. Photometric SED fitting shows excellent agreement with AGN templates, strongly suggesting a rare dual AGN system. BPT diagrams and high ionisation lines further support the presence of AGNs. VLT/MUSE observations reveal strong extended Ly$\\alpha$ emission, extending to $>22$ kpc, making it one of the most extended Ly$\\alpha$ nebulae at $z \\sim 6$. This provides observational evidence of anisotropic AGN-driven photoionization or shocks. The high Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction also indicates an AGN outflow. This dual AGN candidate is also associated with a well-defined overdensity, potentially at the center of a $z \\sim 5.4$ protocluster or filamentary structure node. Further analysis indicates the fraction of dual AGNs is significantly higher than theoretically expected at high redshifts. This discovery provides a new opportunity to study dual AGN interactions and their impact on the circumgalactic medium and cosmic structure evolution.",

        "abstract": "Low-mass stars and brown dwarfs -- spectral types (SpTs) M0 and later -- play a significant role in studying stellar and substellar processes and demographics, reaching down to planetary-mass objects. Currently, the classification of these sources remains heavily reliant on visual inspection of spectral features, equivalent width measurements, or narrow-/wide-band spectral indices. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods offer automated approaches for spectral typing, which are becoming increasingly important as large spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, SDSS, and SPHEREx generate datasets containing millions of spectra. We investigate the application of ML in spectral type classification on low-resolution (R $\\sim$ 120) near-infrared spectra of M0--T9 dwarfs obtained with the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We specifically aim to classify the gravity- and metallicity-dependent subclasses for late-type dwarfs. We used binned fluxes as input features and compared the efficacy of spectral type estimators built using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models. We tested the influence of different normalizations and analyzed the relative importance of different spectral regions for surface gravity and metallicity subclass classification. Our best-performing model (using KNN) classifies 95.5 $\\pm$ 0.6% of sources to within $\\pm$1 SpT, and assigns surface gravity and metallicity subclasses with 89.5 $\\pm$ 0.9% accuracy. We test the dependence of signal-to-noise ratio on classification accuracy and find sources with SNR $\\gtrsim$ 60 have $\\gtrsim$ 95% accuracy.

        "abstract": "A key science goal of large sky surveys such as those conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and precursors to the Square Kilometre Array is the identification of variable and transient objects. One approach is the statistical analysis of the time series of the changing brightness of sources, that is, their light curves. However, finding adequate statistical representations of light curves is challenging because of data quality issues such as sparsity of observations, irregular sampling, and other nuisance factors inherent in astronomical data collection. The wide diversity of objects that a large-scale survey will observe also means that making parametric assumptions about the shape of light curves is problematic. We present a Gaussian process (GP) regression approach for characterising light curve variability that addresses these challenges. Our approach makes no assumptions about the shape of a light curve and, therefore, is general enough to detect a range of variable source types. In particular, we propose using the joint distribution of GP amplitude hyperparameters to distinguish variable and transient candidates from nominally stable ones and apply this approach to 6394 radio light curves from the ThunderKAT survey. We compare our results with two variability metrics commonly used in radio astronomy, namely $\\eta_\\nu$ and $V_\\nu$, and show that our approach has better discriminatory power and interpretability. Finally, we conduct a rudimentary search for transient sources in the ThunderKAT dataset to demonstrate how our approach might be used as an initial screening tool. Computational notebooks in Python and R are available to help facilitate the deployment of this framework to other surveys.",

All those puzzles can be understood in a coherent way if we assume that first massive black holes (MBHs, the \"heavy eggs\") formed by directly collapsing from wave CDM haloes, which can be even earlier than the formation of first galaxies (the \"chickens\"). We elucidate two false obstacles that have been believed to prevent wave CDM haloes from collapsing into black holes (namely \"maximum stable mass\" and \"bosenova\") and point out that general-relativistic instabilities (e.g., the non-axisymmetric instability numerically found in spinning scalar-field boson stars) could serve as the concrete mechanisms for direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) born from wave dark matter. Once the MBHs formed, star formation bursts in and around the accretion flows, characteristic of a special mode in compact regions of high gravitational accelerations.",

In this work, we derive from first principles the three proposed clusters in this region, refine the membership list and cluster ages, and, for the first time, examine the 3D structure, motion, and origin of the clusters. Using clustering of Gaia data in 3D position + 2D velocity space, supplemented by available SDSS-V radial velocities, we find the clusters of ages 10, 15.8, and 20 Myr with members numbering 140, 469, and 184, respectively. All three clusters overlap currently in 3D space. Tracing their previous location, based on present-day motions, shows that each cluster originated in its own distinct region and exhibited no influence on each other's formation. Two of the clusters trace their origin to different areas within the Cam OB1 association, with the oldest cluster tracing its origins to the near edge of the Perseus arm, in the direction of the Per OB1 or Cas 0B6 associations. Overall, this work illustrates how different stellar groups, even those originating in a different spiral arm, can visit and pass through each other as they travel through the Galaxy.",

Motivated by the resurgence of II efforts over the past two decades, this work presents simulations demonstrating the estimation of stellar parameters for a radially pulsating star, such as Polaris, using either a single telescope or multiple telescopes. For single-telescope simulations, we assume that the photon pixels in the camera are mapped onto four distinct regions of the aperture, generating multiple baselines and enabling enhanced observational plane coverage.

        "abstract": "We investigate the stellar structure of neutron stars in the framework of Starobinsky gravity, characterized by a quadratic correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action, $f(R) = R + \\alpha R^2$. In order to {\\em preserve causality throughout\\/} the star, we adopt a two-phase hybrid construction for the stellar matter, in which the core region consists of deconfined quark matter described by the MIT bag model, while the outer layers are composed of hadronic matter represented by unified equations of state such as SLy4, BSk20, and BSk21. Within this framework, we derive the modified field equations with static spherical symmetry, and numerically integrate the corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations with the chosen hybrid equations of state. Our analyses show that, unlike in general relativity, the Ricci scalar remains nonzero outside the stellar surface, and gradually falls to zero beyond 50 km, while the stellar surface remains within 10--12 km for the hybrid equations of state considered. This extended Ricci scalar profile arises from the extra degree of freedom (scalaron) inherent in Starobinsky gravity, which also contributes to the gravitational mass outside the star, causing the ADM mass measured at infinity to exceed the stellar mass at the surface. Nevertheless, the key physical relationships, such as the mass-central density and mass-radius curves, remain consistent with what is expected physically. Notably, we find that the maximum stable mass of neutron stars increases with the Starobinsky parameter $\\alpha$, with the combined MIT-BSk21 model supporting an ADM mass of up to $2.07 \\, M_\\odot$ for $\\alpha = 10\\,r_g^2$. This theoreical limit for a nonrotating neutron star suggests that a rotating configuration could reach mass thresholds in the range of $2.48$ to $2.59 \\, M_\\odot$, considering that rapid rotation can enhance the maximum mass by approximately 20--25\\%.",

Dark matter affects the cooling properties by a modification of the nuclear density profiles, but also changes stellar radius and maximum mass.

        "abstract": "We report the RAD@home citizen science discovery of two rare spiral-host radio galaxies (NGC 3898 and WISEA J221656.57-132042434.1 or RAD-\"Thumbs up\" galaxy), both exhibiting asymmetric radio lobes extending over 30 to 220 kiloparsec scales. We present a multi-wavelength image analysis of these two sources using radio, optical, and ultraviolet data. Both host galaxies are young, star-forming systems with asymmetric or distorted stellar disks. These disks show similarities to those in galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping, and the radio morphologies resemble those of asymmetric or bent FR-II and wide-angle-tailed radio galaxies. We suggest that non-uniform gas density in the environment surrounding the ram pressure-stripped disks may contribute to the observed asymmetry in the size, shape, and brightness of the bipolar radio lobes. Such environmental effects, when properly accounted for, could help explain many of the non-standard radio morphologies observed in Seyfert galaxies and in recently identified populations of galaxies with galaxy-scale radio jets, now being revealed through deep and sensitive radio surveys with uGMRT, MeerKAT, LOFAR, and, in the future, the SKAO. These findings also underscore the potential of citizen science to complement professional research and data-driven approaches involving machine learning and artificial intelligence in the analysis of complex radio sources.",

        "abstract": "We study the evolution of white dwarf (WD) magnetic fields that originate from core-convective dynamos during the main-sequence. Using stellar evolution and WD cooling models combined with magnetic field diffusion calculations, we demonstrate that a surviving field from the main-sequence can account for various features observed in magnetic WDs. In particular, the earlier emergence of stronger magnetic fields in more massive WDs, compared to older, less massive, and less magnetic ones, can be explained by this framework. This is because the magnetic boundary at the onset of WD cooling lies deeper in less massive WDs, resulting in a slower and weaker evolution of the surface magnetic field due to increasing electrical conductivity over time. We further show that many of the magnetic field strengths observed across different WD samples can be reproduced if the deep-seated field generated during the main sequence is comparable to predictions from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of core-convective dynamos, or if equipartition provides a valid scaling for the main-sequence dynamo. Additionally, our predictions for surface magnetic fields vary by a factor of 2 to 4 when higher-order modes of poloidal magnetic field expansion and turbulent diffusion driven by crystallization-induced convection are included. These effects should therefore be considered when investigating the origin of magnetic fields in individual WDs.",

The cyclic evolution is governed by standard dilaton-gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensions with a perturbatively generated potential and a coupling between the dilaton and a second field that becomes massless at $\\phi= \\phi_{ESP}$, resulting in an enhanced symmetry point (ESP) that prevents the dilaton from running all the way to zero coupling. A central role is played by instant folded strings (IFSs) - fundamental strings with the unusual property of being much lighter than the string mass while extending far beyond the string length, and violating the Null Energy Condition (NEC). IFSs are produced classically when the string coupling grows with time, which occurs at two critical points in each cycle. In turn, they fulfill a dual function: enabling cosmological bounces and initiating transient epochs of dark-energy domination that naturally transition into slow contraction. The resulting cosmology eliminates the cosmic singularity and multiverse problems of big bang inflationary models and robustly predicts time-varying IFS-induced dark energy and the absence of primordial B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background.",

        "abstract": "Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) are transients associated with mass ejection during stellar mergers and common envelope evolution (CEE). LRNe have the potential to illuminate the poorly understood phases of binary evolution leading up to the CEE, during the mass ejection phase, and in the immediate aftermath. However, the mechanism responsible for powering LRN light curves and the origin of their observed diversity remain open questions. Here, we perform two-dimensional moving-mesh radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of LRNe that take into account hydrogen recombination and relevant opacities. We study a typical high-mass stellar merger, which dynamically ejects 2 $M_\\odot$ with a characteristic velocity of 410 km/s. This ejecta collides with 2.7 $M_\\odot$ of equatorially concentrated circumbinary material (CBM) left behind from a prior phase of non-conservative runaway mass transfer. We find that the resulting light curve is composed of a short, blue peak followed by a redder, predominantly shock-powered plateau with luminosities reaching up to $10^{41}$ erg/s and durations up to 200 days. These luminosities are significantly higher, and the durations much longer, than those produced by a simple spherical ejection of the same mass. They also depend in a complex way on the radial distribution of the CBM. The shock is embedded in the ejecta and its observational signatures during the optically-thick phase are largely hidden. Our results are broadly compatible with observations of the brightest extragalactic LRNe and pave the way for the transformation of LRNe into powerful probes of binary evolution.",

        "abstract": "A very few three-dimensional (3D) periodic orbits of general three-body problem (with three finite masses) have been discovered since Newton mentioned it in 1680s. Using a high-accuracy numerical strategy we discovered 10,059 three-dimensional periodic orbits of the three-body problem in the cases of $m_{1}=m_{2}=1$ and $m_{3}=0.1n$ where $1\\leq n\\leq 20$ is an integer, among which 1,996 (about 20\\%) are linearly stable. Note that our approach is valid for arbitrary mass $m_{3}$ so that in theory we can gain an arbitrarily large amount of 3D periodic orbits of the three-body problem. In the case of three equal masses, we discovered twenty-one 3D ``choerographical'' periodic orbits whose three bodies move periodically in a single closed orbit. It is very interesting that, in the case of two equal masses, we discovered 273 three-dimensional periodic orbits with the two bodies ($m_{1}=m_{2}=1$) moving along a single closed orbit and the third ($m_{3}\\neq 1$) along a different one: we name them ``piano-trio'' orbits, like a trio for two violins and one piano. To the best of our knowledge, all of these 3D periodic orbits have never been reported, indicating the novelty of this work. The large amount of these new 3D periodic orbits are helpful for us to have better understandings about chaotic properties of the famous three-body problem, which ``are, so to say, the only opening through which we can try to penetrate in a place which, up to now, was supposed to be inaccessible'', as pointed out by Poincar\\'e, the founder of chaos theory.",

The total outflow lifetime of each source determined in the context of detailed cosmological studies was found to depend only upon the luminosity in directed kinetic energy ($L$). The distributions of $L$, total outflow lifetime, and total outflow energy each have a broad range of values, as do the supermassive black hole masses. The total outflow energy relative to the black hole mass is a small number with a small dispersion. Three explanations of these remarkable results are considered. This could indicate (1) the efficiencies with which black hole irreducible mass is increased and spin mass energy is extracted during the outflow event, (2) that the merger of two supermassive black holes occurs over a timescale commensurate with the independently determined outflow lifetime and that these mergers lead to the production of the low-frequency gravitational wave background, or (3) that feedback shuts off black hole accretion due to energy injected into the ambient medium.",

CAPOS, the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey, addresses this key topic by observing a large number of BGCs, most of which have been poorly studied. We aim to obtain accurate mean values for metallicity,[alpha/Fe],and radial velocity, as well as abundances for 11 other elements. We present final parameters based on ASPCAP for all 18 CAPOS BGCs. We carry out a stringent membership selection, finding 303 with SNR>70 and 125 with lower SNR. We reinforced the finding that stars with high [N/Fe] abundances show higher [Fe/H] than their lower [N/Fe] counterparts. Mg,Ca and global alpha abundances show similar trends, while Si is well-behaved. The [Fe/H] value of these 2nd population stars is corrected to derive the mean metallicity. Mean metallicities are determined to a precision of 0.05 dex,[alpha/Fe] to 0.06 dex, and radial velocity to 3.4 km/s. No clusters show strong evidence for internal metallicity variation, including M22. Abundances for 11 other elements using only 1st population stars are calculated and are generally in good agreement with the literature. We develope a new chemodynamical GC classification scheme, synthesizing several recent studies. We also compile up-to-date metallicities. The BGC metallicity distribution is bimodal, with peaks at [Fe/H]=-0.45 and -1.1, with the metal-poor peak strongly dominant, while exsitu GCs are unimodal, with a peak at -1.6. Surprisingly, we find only a small, statistically insignificant difference in the mean [Si/Fe] of in and exsitu GCs. The 4 GCs with the lowest [Si/Fe] values are all exsitu, relatively young, and 3 belong to Sagittarius, but no other correlations are evident.",

Observing planetary auroral radio emissions is among the most promising detection methods, but decades of searching have yet to yield a conclusive detection, though promising hints are now emerging from ground-based radio telescopes. However, these ground-based efforts are fundamentally limited by Earth's ionosphere, which blocks the low-frequency signals (<10 MHz) expected from terrestrial and Neptune-like exoplanets. In this white paper, we outline a strategy to overcome this barrier by utilizing the unique environment of the Moon. We discuss how the upcoming LuSEE-Night and ROLSES pathfinder missions will study our Solar System's planets as exoplanet analogs and place the first meaningful upper limits on exoplanetary radio flux below 10 MHz. Furthermore, we explore the revolutionary potential of the proposed future lunar arrays FarView and FARSIDE. For example, FarView will be sensitive enough to study the magnetic fields of a diverse set of exoplanets (super-Earths to gas giants) and an order of magnitude more Jupiter-like planets than ground-based telescopes, providing crucial tests for dynamo theory. Most significantly, FARSIDE will be able to detect the magnetospheres of nearby terrestrial exoplanets, offering a powerful synergy with atmospheric characterization efforts by JWST and HWO to fully assess their potential habitability. By opening this unexplored low-frequency window, radio astronomy from the Moon is poised to transform the field of exoplanet magnetospheric science. [Abridged]",

In this letter, we show that both merging black holes may have a primordial origin with smaller initial masses. The observed masses and, crucially, the spins of GW231123 are naturally accommodated within the most vanilla primordial black hole framework, once cosmological accretion is taken into account. Interestingly, the parameter space needed to explain the inferred GW231123 rate is at the edge of the exclusion region from Xray and CMB observations, suggesting that this interpretation can be either confirmed or ruled out. The upcoming O5 observing run by the collaboration should detect ${\\cal O}(20)$ similar events, testing their mass-spin correlation, while next-generation detectors would be capable of observing high redshift events, as predicted in this scenario.",

A ten-year monitoring of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser was carried out with the Torun 32 m radio telescope. The archival data collected so far were also used to characterize the target with high angular resolution and examine its infrared variability. Results. We found anticorrelated flux variations of the opposite blueshifted and redshifted emission features with a period of 70.1 (2.2) d and the relative amplitude of 1.3 and 0.6, respectively. The light curves are best fit with a sinusoidal function modulated by mild changes in the average flux density on 3-5 yr timescales. The emission of the middle parts of the spectrum shows only long-term variability. High-angular-resolution data indicate that the maser is associated with one of the two 1.3 mm dust emission cores, while the periodic comes from two extended regions ~1500 au apart. We discuss several possible causes of the peculiar variability.",

We can now probe the composition of the planet-forming regions of disks, and that in gas-giant exoplanets, to scrutinise these theories and diagnostics. So far, ALMA has revealed that the outer disk regions are typically metal-depleted and O-poor, whereas JWST is showing that the inner disk regions around Sun-like stars are mostly O-rich. Further, JWST is showing that most transiting gas-giant planets are typically metal-enriched and O-rich, consistent with formation at/within the water snowline and pollution by icy bodies.

The X-ray LP arises from multiple scattering of initially soft photons in a hot, optically thick Compton cloud (CC) using a flat geometry. ST85 showed that the LP degree $P$ depends on the binary inclination $i$ and remains independent of the photon energy. Moreover, the $P$ follows a characteristic angular distribution based on the CC optical depth $\\tau_0$, in particular for $\\tau_0 >$ 10 the LP follows the Chandrasekhar (1950) distribution. In light of the vast number of recent IXPE spectro-polarimetric observations of BHs, testing this approach in combination with spectral analysis of these sources by other missions is desirable. In particular, the BH source, 4U 1957+115 was observed with IXPE in the high/soft state for which $P\\sim 2\\%$ was found (Marra et al. 2024). To apply the new method, in addition to knowing $P$ for a given source, it is necessary to estimate the CC optical depth $\\tau_0$ and then to calculate of the best-fit photon index $\\Gamma$ and the plasma temperature $kT_e$. We present the X-ray spectral analysis of 4U~1957+11 using data from IXPE, NuSTAR, NICER, RXTE}, Swift, Suzaku and ASCA. We show that the X-ray source spectra are well described by the Comptonization model with $\\Gamma$ varying from 1.5 to 3. We find a monotonic increase in $\\Gamma$ with the mass accretion rate, $\\dot M$, and a final saturation of the index at $\\Gamma\\sim3$ for high $\\dot M$. We determine a BH mass by the scaling method: $M_{1957}=4.8 \\pm 1.8~M_{\\odot}$, assuming a source distance of 22 kpc, using H 1743-322, 4U 1630-47, and GRS 1915+105 as reference sources.",

While Einstein's gravity has traditionally been employed to examine neutron stars, recent observational advancements have revealed its limitations in accurately describing high-mass astronomical objects-particularly in predicting or explaining certain observed neutron star masses. In response, this research seeks to address the limitations of Einstein's gravity in characterizing high-mass neutron stars by modifying the gravitational action and incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. This term holds significant dynamical relevance in higher dimensions, particularly within the context of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity explored in this study, thereby providing a more realistic description of gravitational phenomena under extreme conditions. By deriving the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and utilizing the AV18 potential, we analyze the profiles of metric functions, density and pressure, gradients of density and pressure, the anisotropic function and its trace, mass-function and compactness, the mass-radius curve, surface redshift function, equation of state parameters, and radial and tangential sound speeds. Additionally, stability factors, adiabatic indices, and energy conditions are examined. The results indicate that all conditions are satisfied for specific values of the coupling constant, confirming the physical stability of the model. Furthermore, higher dimensions enhance resistance to gravitational collapse, resulting in an increase in the maximum mass predicted by the proposed model. Ultimately, calculations show that the modified Buchdahl inequality is satisfied as well.",

While an association of the nebula with the cluster has been suggested in the past, this has been never confirmed. Here, we present accurate trigonometric parallax and proper motion measurements using VLBI observations of masers in the nebula and Gaia DR3 data for the cluster.   Methods. We observed 22 GHz H2O and 43 GHz SiO masers around OH 231.8+4.2 using the Very Long Baseline Array at 4 epochs over 1 year. We also calculated the parallax and proper motion of the open star cluster M 46 using Gaia DR3 data.   Results. Based on astrometric monitoring for 1 year, we measured an annual parallax of OH 231.8+4.2 to be 0.65 +\\- 0.01 mas (stat.) +\\- 0.02 mas (syst.), corresponding to a distance of 1.54 +\\- 0.05 kpc. This agrees well with the parallax of M 46 from the Gaia DR3 data, which is 0.639 +\\- 0.001 mas (stat.) +\\- 0.010 mas (syst.). We re-estimated the luminosity of OH 231.8+4.2 to be 1.4 x 10^4 L_sol. However, there is a 15 km/s velocity difference between OH 231.8+4.2 and M 46 which could be caused by a past merger event.",

        "abstract": "The Standard Model (SM) leaves several fundamental questions unanswered, including the origin of neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, and the nature of dark matter. Motivated by these gaps, we investigate an extension of the SM with an additional local $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry and a complex scalar singlet that spontaneously breaks this symmetry via its vacuum expectation value. The extended framework naturally accommodates three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) to ensure anomaly cancellation and implements a type-I seesaw mechanism for active neutrino masses. We perform a detailed numerical analysis demonstrating consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, including predictions for the effective Majorana mass parameter relevant to neutrinoless double beta decay. Furthermore, we estimate the key parameters of the first-order phase transition and compute the resulting stochastic gravitational wave spectrum, demonstrating that it can lie within the reach of forthcoming experiments such as LISA, DECIGO, BBO, and the Einstein Telescope. The right-handed neutrinos also open a viable path for thermal leptogenesis, providing a unified link between neutrino mass generation, baryogenesis, and gravitational wave signatures. Our results demonstrate that this minimal $U(1)_X$ scenario remains a promising probe for physics beyond the Standard Model, accessible through upcoming gravitational wave and neutrino experiments.",

Two flares with a separation time of $\\sim$7.2\\,yr between the two optical peaks are observed. Related mid-infrared (MIR) flares, with delay times of $\\sim$200\\,day are also seen. We analyze two optical spectra of the TDE source, onenear the optical peak of the second flare from the Transient Name Server and one at the quiescent flux level after the second flare. The latter was taken by us with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. Comparing the features of the two spectra, we identify that the host is likely a composite galaxy at redshift 0.23 and the TDE event, probably an H+He type, mainly powered broad components in the emission lines of H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$, and He~I $\\lambda$5876. More interestingly, we find that two Bronze-type neutrino events, detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory, match the TDE in position and the second flare, especially the delayed MIR flare, in time.

The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory detected photons with energies up to $\\sim 13$~TeV during the early afterglow phase, challenging standard EBL models. We investigate whether several theoretical frameworks can explain this anomalous emission: reduced EBL opacity due to cosmic voids along the line of sight, novel emission mechanisms within the GRB environment, secondary $\\gamma$-ray production through cosmic-ray cascades, and new-physics scenarios involving Lorentz-invariance violation or axion-like particles. Our analysis highlights the exceptional nature of this event and ongoing theoretical tensions about the dominant physical processes. We discuss the limitations of current models and identify specific observational signatures that future multiwavelength and multi-messenger observations could provide to discriminate between competing explanations. Continued study of similar events with next-generation facilities will be crucial for resolving these challenges and advancing our understanding of extreme particle acceleration in astrophysical environments.",

        "abstract": "The fate of the remnant following the merger of two neutron stars initially on quasicircular orbits depends primarily on the mass of the initial neutron stars, the mass ratio, and the still-uncertain dense-matter equation of state (EoS). Previous works studying the threshold mass for prompt collapse to a black hole have primarily focused on the uncertainties in the zero-temperature EoS, which are parametrized by a macroscopic quantity such as the characteristic neutron star radius. However, prompt collapse can take place either with or without a core bounce during the merger. In the bounce-collapse scenario, shocks can produce additional thermal support, potentially altering the threshold for collapse. In this work, we investigate the impact of the uncertainties in the finite-temperature part of the nuclear EoS on the threshold mass for prompt collapse in equal mass mergers. Using two cold EoSs, combined with four parametrizations of the finite-temperature part of the EoS, we find that the threshold mass is insensitive to realistic variations of the thermal prescription, at sub-percent accuracy. We report on the thermal properties and ejecta of mergers with masses just above the threshold mass, i.e., which experience a single core-bounce before collapsing. During the bounce, the thermal pressure can reach )(1-10)% of the cold pressure at supranuclear densities, depending on the thermal treatment, leading to modest differences in the dynamical ejecta that are launched and in the remnant disk mass as a result.",

        "abstract": "The origin of the universal asymmetry between matter and antimatter remains a mystery. Electroweak baryogenesis is a well-motivated mechanism for generating the asymmetry dynamically, using interesting features of the Standard Model. In addition, it relies on beyond-the-Standard Model physics active around the electroweak scale: new physics coupling to the Higgs to make the electroweak phase transition first order, and a new mechanism of CP violation. The relatively low energy scale at which electroweak baryogenesis occurs makes certain aspects of the mechanism testable through collider experiments, electric dipole moment measurements, and gravitational wave observations. However, scenarios of electroweak baryogenesis are increasingly challenged by results from contemporary experiments. The developing experimental programs will play a crucial role in either falsifying or detecting the new physics responsible for electroweak baryogenesis. To achieve this, it is essential to make precise predictions for the baryon asymmetry and the corresponding experimental signatures within specific scenarios. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the rich physics involved in these predictions. Our goal is to offer a practical computational guide, with a focus on recent developments in the field.",

We particularize the latter for the case when a finite chiral charge density is present. The axion field is thus coupled to a generic function $Q(F_0,G_0)$ depending on Lorentz invariants $F_0, G_0$ which can be constructed from these electromagnetic fields. From this, the static axion field equations are solved as function of stellar radial coordinate and angular direction, $a(r,\\theta)$, using a prescribed linear form for $Q$. In addition, we use a semi-analytical approach to calculate the stellar structure in this hybrid system where pressure components are treated under a perturbative scheme, provided induced deformations with respect to spherical symmetry are tiny. Our results show that the axion couplings to magnetic and electric fields along with its mass, critically determine the axion spatial distribution. Furthermore, we focus on the possibility that the axion field might accumulate in specific outer regions of the star, particularly within the crust, where it could form a condensate. We explore the possible presence of magnetic flux tubes from superconductor phases in this outer layers and qualitatively show they may enhance local conversion into photons.

Remote observations have largely been limited to the low corona ($2$) have only been sampled at 1 au and beyond. As a result, theories that address heavy ion heating and acceleration remain largely unconstrained. With the launch of Solar Orbiter, heavy ion kinetics can be probed closer to the Sun, as close as the orbit of Mercury ($65R_{\\odot}$), to examine their radial behavior. Through a statistical analysis of O$^{6+}$, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of the velocity and temperature of O$^{6+}$ from 0.3 au to 1 au. The study finds that the O$^{6+}$ relative drift, normalized to the local Alfv\\'en speed, and its temperature compared to protons, both decrease with distance from the Sun and show some speed dependence. The O$^{6+}$ temperature is well fit by a single temperature adiabatic profile across all wind speeds, suggesting there is no significant heating at these heliocentric distances. This is in contrast to what is observed for protons and He$^{2+}$. Alfv\\'enic fluctuations, with full 180$^{\\circ}$ field rotation, create momentary negative differential streaming where the speed of O$^{6+}$ trails the protons. The amount of negative differential streaming gradually increases at larger distances. These results provide critical constraints to the proposed mechanisms seeking to describe ion heating and acceleration in the solar wind.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of exoplanets has expanded our understanding of planetary systems and opened new avenues for astronomical research. In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework for exoplanet identification using a time-series photometric dataset from the Kepler Space Telescope, comprising 3,198 flux measurements across 5,074 stars. We investigate the performance of four supervised classification algorithms, namely Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, using a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), confusion matrices, and learning curves. Among the models, Random Forest achieves the highest accuracy (99.8\\%) and near-perfect F1-scores, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness. KNN also performs strongly, achieving 99.3\\% accuracy, while Decision Tree demonstrates moderate performance with 97.1\\% accuracy, and Logistic Regression trails behind with the lowest accuracy and generalization at 95.8\\%. Notably, the application of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) significantly improves performance across all models by addressing class imbalance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of ensemble-based machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest, in handling large volumes of photometric data for automated exoplanet detection. This approach holds significant potential for implementation at ground-based facilities, such as the Iranian National Observatory (INO), where such extensive and precise datasets can further advance exoplanet discovery and characterization efforts.",

        "title": "A Compact Story of Positivity in de Sitter",
        "abstract": "Recent developments have yielded significant progress towards systematically understanding loop corrections to de Sitter (dS) correlators. In close analogy with physics in Anti-de Sitter (AdS), large logarithms can result from loops that can be interpreted as corrections to the dimensions of operators. In contrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that the theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent, particularly in the presence of light scalars. In this paper, we revisit these issues by performing and comparing calculations using the spectral representation approach and the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). We review the general arguments that yield positivity constraints on dS correlators from both perspectives. Our particular focus will be on vertex operators for compact scalar fields, since this case introduces novel complications. We will explain how to resolve apparent disagreements between different techniques for calculating the anomalous dimensions for principal series fields coupled to these vertex operators. Along the way, we will offer new proofs of positivity of the anomalous dimensions, and explain why renormalization group flow associated with these anomalous dimensions in SdSET is the same as resumming bubble diagrams in the spectral representation.",

        "abstract": "Building on the feasibility study in CERN-PBC Report-2018-002 (Arduini et al. 2018), this report supported by the Physics Beyond Colliders (PBC) Study Group describes the technical implementation of modifications to the PX46 shaft at LHC Point 4 during LS3 (June 2026 - June 2030) that would enable it to accommodate the installation and operation of a vertical long-baseline Atom Interferometer during Run 4 without affecting LHC operations. We specify in detail the necessary civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and design of a mobile elevator platform. Our comprehensive technical assessment identifies no fundamental obstacles or showstoppers to implementation. Refined cost estimates and a critical-path schedule confirm that, from formal approval, all interventions can be completed within a 1.5-year window. These preparations would ensure seamless, concurrent operation of the Atom Interferometer experiment and the HL-LHC, with all technical challenges successfully addressed through established engineering solutions.",

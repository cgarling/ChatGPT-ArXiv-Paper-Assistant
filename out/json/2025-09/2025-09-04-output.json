        "abstract": "Context: While the LMC's influence on MW stellar streams has been extensively studied, streams associated with the Clouds have received far less attention. Beyond the Magellanic Stream, only four stream candidates (S1-S4) have been reported. Aims: We focus on the S3 stream, a long ($\\sim30^\\circ$) and narrow ($\\sim1.2^\\circ$) structure at 60-80 kpc, nearly aligned with the LMC. Our goals are: 1) to validate the stream through a kinematic analysis of S3 candidates with Gaia DR3 data; 2) to enlarge the sample of potential members; and 3) to model the stream in order to test its association with either the MW or the LMC. Methods: We selected new S3 candidates with a neural network classifier trained on Gaia DR3 data, and further reduced contamination through a cut in the proper-motion space. To investigate the origin of S3, we evolve stream models within time-dependent, deforming MW and LMC haloes, thereby accounting for possible effects of the MW-LMC interaction. Results: We identify 1,542 high-confidence new S3 stream candidates and find that the stream's apparent width has grown from $\\sim1.2^\\circ$ to $\\sim3$-$4^\\circ$ compared to previous studies. We also present a list of 440 potential S3 red clump stars, which are valuable targets for spectroscopic follow-up thanks to their well-defined luminosities and ability to yield precise distances. Both modelling and a comparison of S3 stars' closest approach distance and velocity with the LMC's escape velocity indicate that S3 is unlikely to originate from the LMC, instead representing a distant ($\\sim75$ kpc) MW stream. Conclusions: S3 is the most distant ($\\sim75$ kpc) extended ($\\sim30^\\circ$ long, $\\sim3$-$4^\\circ$ thick) MW stream known, offering a unique probe of the outer halo and the LMC's recent influence. Its angular width corresponds to a physical thickness of $\\sim4$-5 kpc, making S3 among the thickest streams discovered.",

        "abstract": "The particle mass of dark matter (DM) was previously constrained using kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies to $m > 3 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. This constraint, which excludes the \"fuzzy\" range of ultra-light dark matter from comprising all of the DM, relies on an estimate of the heating rate from fuzzy dark matter (FDM) wave interference using linear perturbation theory. Here, we compare the results of this perturbative calculation to full Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson simulations of the evolution of star particles in FDM halos. This comparison confirms theoretical expectations that FDM heating is stronger in fully nonlinear simulations due to the formation of a dense central soliton whose fluctuations enhance gravitational perturbations, and that bounds on the DM particle mass using this perturbative method are indeed conservative. We also show that these bounds are not affected by possible tidal stripping, since for dwarf satellites like Segue 1, the tidal radius is much larger than the observed size of the galaxy. We further show that the constraints on the mass cannot be evaded by invoking DM self-interactions, due to constraints on the self-interaction from large-scale structure. Lastly, we show that if the recently discovered system Ursa Major III/UNIONS I is a galaxy, the observed properties of this object strengthen the lower bound on the DM mass by over an order of magnitude, to $m > 8 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, at 95% confidence.

        "abstract": "Motivated by the observation of extended stellar cores in dark matter (DM) dominated dwarf galaxies, this study investigates a simple mechanism by which stellar cores can form as a result of DM halo expansion. Several non-CDM models predict that the DM distribution thermalizes over time, transforming initially cuspy halos into cores. This transformation weakens the gravitational potential, allowing the stellar component to expand and form diffuse, core-like structures. Using analytical models and adiabatic invariants, we examine stellar systems with purely tangential, purely radial, and isotropic orbits evolving under a slowly changing potential. Across a wide range of initial and final conditions, we find that stellar cores form relatively easily, though their properties depend sensitively on these conditions. Orbit types preserve their nature during the DM halo expansion: tangential and radial orbits remain so, while isotropic orbits remain nearly isotropic in the central regions. Systems with circular orbits develop stellar cores when the initial stellar density logarithmic slope lies between -0.5 and -1.2, whereas radial systems do not form cores. Isotropic systems behave similarly to tangential ones, producing cores that are isotropic in the center but develop increasing radial anisotropy outward; the anisotropy parameter \"beta\" grows from sim 0.07 at the core radius to sim 0.5 at three core radii. The theoretical and observational literature suggests initial DM profiles with steep slopes and stellar distributions that are shallower and isotropic at the center. Given these conditions, the mechanism predicts stellar cores with radii at least 40 % that of the DM core and inner logarithmic slopes shallower than 0.6.",

The relatively constant absorber strength with galactocentric distance implies a clumpy structure of cool gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Further, we find a positive correlation between $W_{2796}$ versus $M_\\star$, and SFR, suggesting that the distribution of metal-enriched cool gas in the CGM is closely tied to the properties of the host galaxies. The redshift evolution of gas-phase metallicity suggests that strong MgII absorbers trace the general population of star-forming galaxies. The velocity dispersion of the cool gas increases with halo mass, and the wide range of line of sight velocity offset (-389 to 364 $\\rm km\\ s^{-1}$) between the galaxy systemic velocity and absorbers highlights the dynamical nature of CGM.

Here, we investigate warm molecular hydrogen, H2, observed in spectra extracted in $\\sim 120$ pc apertures centered on eleven regions of interest. We detect 7 H2 rotational lines, some of which are among the weakest ever measured. The H2 population diagrams are fit with local-thermodynamic-equilibrium models and models of photodissociation regions. We also fit the ortho-/para-H2 ratios (OPRs); in three of the six regions for which it was possible to fit the OPR, we find values significantly greater than 3, the maximum value for local thermodynamic equilibrium. To our knowledge, although predicted theoretically, this is the first time that OPR significantly $> 3$ has been measured in interstellar gas. We find that OPR tends to increase with decreasing H2 column density, consistent with the expected effects of self-shielding in advancing photodissociation fronts. The population diagrams are consistent with H nucleon densities of $\\sim 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, and an interstellar radiation field scaling factor, G0, of $\\sim 10^3$. This warm, dense H2 gas co-exists with the same highly ionized gas that emits [OIV] and [NeV].

        "abstract": "Some massive, quiescent galaxies at z>3 appear to contain considerable numbers of old stars (forming at z>7). Works inferring the star formation histories of at least one such galaxy observed with JWST have suggested that the assembly of so much stellar mass so early may challenge the well-established Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological framework, or else indicate extraordinarily high past star formation efficiencies. However, these studies implicitly assume that all the stars in place at the epoch of observation assembled in-situ, i.e. in a single galaxy. In hierarchical models like CDM, massive galaxies assemble following successive mergers of smaller galaxies. Thus, inferences of the growth of stellar mass using the ages of stars within a descendant massive galaxy will be biased. In this paper, I use the TNG100 simulation to quantify this bias across a range of descendant galaxy masses and redshifts, for inferences made for different past epochs. I demonstrate that the assumption of in-situ stellar mass assembly can lead to significant biases in inferred stellar mass histories, with historic (i.e. looking back from the epoch of observation) stellar masses overestimated by over an order of magnitude in some cases. The bias increases with increasing halo mass, for inferences made further from the epoch of observation, and with decreasing descendant galaxy redshift. I derive corrections that can be applied to inferred stellar mass histories for more robust comparisons with dark matter halo mass functions at high redshift.",

        "abstract": "A generic prediction of particle dark matter theories is that a large population of dark matter substructures should reside inside the host haloes of galaxies. In gravitational imaging, strong gravitational lens observations are used to detect individual objects from this population, if they are large enough to perturb the strongly lensed images. We show here that low-mass haloes, below the individually detectable mass limit, have a detectable effect on the lensed images when in large numbers, which is the case in cold dark matter (CDM). We find that, in CDM, this population causes an excess of 40 per cent in the number of detected subhaloes for HST-like strong lens observations. We propose a pseudo-mass function to describe this population, and fit for its parameters from the detection data. We find that it mostly consists of objects two orders of magnitude in mass below the detection limit of individual objects. We show that including this modification, so that the effect of the population is correctly predicted, can dramatically improve the available constraints on dark matter from strong lens observations. We repeat our experiments using models that contain varying amounts of angular structure in the lens galaxy. We find that these multipole perturbations are strongly degenerate with the population signal, to an even greater extent than with individual subhaloes. This further highlights the need for better understanding of the angular mass structure of lens galaxies, so that the maximum information can be extracted from strong lens observations for dark matter inference.",

These short-lived hydrogen envelopes - the result of residual hydrogen diffusion - are eventually destroyed by either hydrogen or helium convection. An emerging class of double-faced white dwarfs seems to catch this process in the act, with varying amounts of hydrogen across regions of the stellar surface. Here, we quantitatively test the hypothesis that these inhomogeneities are the result of the magnetic inhibition of convection. We compute the critical magnetic field $B_{\\rm crit}(M,T_{\\rm eff})\\sim\\sqrt{8\\pi P}$ required to inhibit convection in both hydrogen and helium for $0.6-1.2\\,M_\\odot$ white dwarfs, where $P$ is the pressure at the base of the convection zone.

Our approach incorporates CR advection by the background gas, streaming along the magnetic field limited by the local ion Alfv\\'en speed, and diffusion relative to the Alfv\\'en wave frame, with the diffusion coefficient set by the balance between streaming-driven Alfv\\'en wave excitation and damping mediated by local gas properties.

        "abstract": "Context. RR Lyrae stars are key distance indicators and tracers of old stellar populations in the Milky Way and its satellites. Accurate period and amplitude measurements are essential for constraining stellar evolution and mapping Galactic structure. The Javalambre VARiability (J-VAR) survey provides valuable time-series data across seven optical bands, including gri and four medium and narrow bands. Aims. Our goal is to construct and analyze light curves for RR Lyrae stars identified in the first data release (DR1) of the J-VAR survey using the Gaia DR3 variable stars catalog as a reference. Methods. The light curves of 315 RR Lyrae were analyzed by fitting templates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) multiband template library. The periods and amplitudes for the seven bands in J-VAR were independently obtained from the best-fitted templates. Results. The J-VAR periods show strong agreement with Gaia DR3 values, which confirms the reliability of the applied methodology. The Bailey diagram for each J-VAR filter reveals the expected trend for RRab and RRc stars, with larger pulsation amplitudes at bluer wavelengths. After normalizing by the r-band amplitude, an exponential trend is found, with the bluer J-VAR filter centered at 395 nm having twice the amplitude of the reddest J-VAR passband at 861 nm. The normalized amplitudes of the RR Lyrae stars from Gaia and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) are consistent with the J-VAR trend. Finally, the SDSS templates derived from broadbands also provide a proper description for the medium and narrow band light curves. Conclusions. The J-VAR RR Lyrae catalog offers reliable pulsation parameters and light curves in seven optical filters, allowing the systematic study of amplitude trends from 395 to 860 nm and offering a unique benchmark for theoretical models.",

        "abstract": "Interpreting galaxy properties from astronomical surveys relies heavily on spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling, yet uncertainties in key model ingredients are often overlooked. By leveraging a $z\\sim0$ galaxy sample from the EAGLE simulation, we generate synthetic SDSS spectral and VISTA photometric observations with controlled assumptions, to assess how variations in stellar spectral library, initial mass function (IMF) and metallicity prescriptions within the BPASS-framework affect inferred galaxy properties. Our analysis combines spectral fitting from 3800 to 9200 A with photometric constraints extending to 2.3 $\\mu$m, enabling robust assessment across a broad wavelength baseline. Our findings reveal mass, age and star formation rate vary by $0.27\\pm0.09$, $0.19\\pm0.11$ and $1.4\\pm1.0$ dex, respectively, greater than observational uncertainties reported in surveys. Notably, we find stellar spectral library choice is capable of transforming a galaxy from appearing star-forming to quiescent, while a fixed metallicity assumption yields systematic biases when the chosen metallicity is incorrect. These modelling differences impact the reconstructed total mass assembly history in galaxies by up to $\\sim12$ percent and bias the demographic and star formation history conclusions drawn from surveys. As upcoming missions like Euclid, Roman and CASTOR aim to characterise galaxy evolution with unprecedented precision, our results highlight the need for careful propagation of SED modelling uncertainties and transparency in model selection.",

Here we present a unified theoretical framework for the accumulation, fate, and eventual removal of gas released by evolved stars in young GCs, and their implications for the production of multiple stellar populations. Using MIST stellar evolution tracks, we show that low-velocity (10^5 MSun clusters. In addition, AGB winds in such clusters collide with each other and the previously retained winds, triggering a rapid `switch' to efficient gas retention. Expected gas retention fractions, mapped across cluster initial mass and size, agree well with the observed second population fractions in Milky Way GCs. We then show that the accumulated gas cannot form new stars because protostellar cores are disrupted by encounters with pre-existing stars over 1 - 10 kyr. Instead, the gas is accreted onto pre-existing main-sequence stars and compact objects. Bondi-Hoyle accretion and time-dependent core-halo models indicate that both white dwarfs and neutron stars can grow and collapse within a few 100 Myr, and that lower-mass main-sequence stars can be `rejuvenated' into the 4 - 6 MSun range required to reproduce key abundance patterns. Therefore, in our model, the multiple populations will be found in sufficiently massive clusters, with the second-population stars being formed from the inner subset of first-population stars that accreted large fractions of their mass from the AGB-processed retained gas. Finally, we argue that a combination of feedback processes will clear the gas by 10^9 yr, thus reproducing the gas-poor conditions observed for present-day clusters.",

A major challenge in the simulations is in modelling of the outermost layers, known as the envelope, exhibiting a drop of many orders of magnitude in temperature and density in a geometrically thin shell. This is often addressed by constructing a separate envelope model in plane-parallel approximation that produces a relation between the temperature at the bottom of the envelope, $T_b$, and the surface temperature, $T_s$. Our aim is to construct a general framework for approximating the $T_b$-$T_s$ relation that is able to include the dependencies from the strength and orientation of the magnetic field. We used standard prescriptions to calculate a large number of magnetised envelope models to be used as a training sample and employed single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks as approximators, providing the flexibility, high accuracy, and fast evaluation necessary in neutron star simulations. We explored the optimal network architecture and hyperparameter choices and used a special holdout set designed to avoid overfitting to the structure of the input data. We find that relatively simple neural networks are sufficient for the approximation of the $T_b$-$T_s$ relation with an accuracy $\\sim 3\\%$.

Captured DM particles migrate toward the helium-rich core and accumulate into a compact configuration. As the DM population grows, it can become self-gravitating and undergo gravitational collapse, leading to adiabatic contraction through interactions with the ambient medium. The resulting energy release, through elastic scattering and, where relevant, DM annihilation during collapse, locally heats the stellar core and can trigger helium ignition earlier than that predicted by standard stellar evolution. We analyze the conditions under which DM-induced heating leads to runaway helium burning and identify the critical DM mass required for ignition. Imposing the observational constraint that helium ignition must not occur before the observed luminosity at the tip of the RG branch, we translate these conditions into bounds on DM properties. Remarkably, we find that RGs are sensitive to DM, particularly with masses around $10^{11} \\,{\\rm GeV}$ and spin-independent scattering cross sections near $10^{-37}\\,{\\rm cm}^2$, which is comparable to the reach of current terrestrial direct detection experiments.",

Two-point correlation functions demonstrate significant clustering of OBC candidates on scales 100 pc and a strong spatial association with GMCs, consistent with hierarchical star formation in dense gas-rich environments.

Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) provides a powerful alternative by learning directly from forward-modeled simulations. In this work, we apply SBI to the \\textit{Quijote} dark matter simulations and introduce a hierarchical method that integrates small-scale information from field sub-volumes or \\textit{patches} with large-scale statistics such as power spectrum and bispectrum. This hybrid strategy is efficient both computationally and in terms of the amount of training data required. It overcomes the memory limitations associated with full-field training. We show that our approach enhances Fisher information relative to analytical summaries and matches that of a very different approach (wavelet-based statistics), providing evidence that we are estimating the full information content of the dark matter density field at the resolution of $\\sim 7.8~\\mathrm{Mpc}/h$.",

Both gravitational perturbations and the external pressure exerted by the hot ICM on the galaxy ISM during its high velocity journey within the cluster are able to remove most, if not all of it, producing extended tails of stripped material. Along with the different gas phases (cold atomic and molecular, ionised, hot), these perturbations can remove also dust, thus contributing to the pollution of the ICM. Probe Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is offering a unique opportunity to observe this dust component, a crucial ingredient in the energetic balance of the stripped gas. We analyse how the two instruments onboard of PRIMA, PRIMAger (in imaging and polarimetric mode) and far-IR enhanced survey spectrometer (FIRESS), can be used to observe a selected sample of ram pressure stripped tails detected at other frequencies (HI, CO, Halpha, X-rays). These data can be used to determine the relative distribution of the dust component with respect to that of the other gas phases, derive its temperature, calculate different gas physical parameters (electron density, photoelectric heating efficiency, gas metallicity), and quantify the strength of the turbulent magnetic fields, all fundamental parameters used to constrain the most recent hydrodynamic simulations of gas stripping in clusters. The ultimate aim of this research is that of understanding the fate of the cold stripped material once mixed with the surrounding hot medium and study under which condition it can collapse into giant molecular clouds (GMC) to form new stars.",

        "abstract": "Double degenerate white dwarf (WD) mergers can exhibit extreme magnetic fields exceeding $10^{8}$ G and rapid rotation, but their spectral-energy distributions and high-energy emission mechanisms remain poorly characterised. ZTF J1901+1458 stands out as the most compact and strongly magnetised object discovered in this class to date. Recent Chandra observations have revealed that the white dwarf is also a source of soft X-ray emission, inconsistent with a photospheric origin. We analyse new phase resolved UV spectroscopy from the HST combined with optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy, with newly developed magnetic atmosphere models to determine its effective temperature, radius, mass, average surface magnetic field strength, and cooling age. Our results demonstrate that the spectral break at $\\approx$3000 {\\AA}, observed in several highly magnetised WDs, is well-reproduced by our new models, which take into account the effect of magnetic opacities on the structure of the atmosphere. Our best-fit parameters for the WD yield an effective temperature ($T_{\\rm{eff}}=28,015\\pm 20$ K) and larger radius ($2630\\pm10$ km) than previously reported. Furthermore, the near-infrared data exclude the presence of a stellar or brown dwarf companion hotter than $\\approx$700 K. We also jointly analyse the previously published Chandra data and new XMM-Newton X-ray spectra. The faint X-ray emission, $L_X =(1.3\\pm0.2)\\times10^{27}$ erg/s is very soft and highly pulsed on the rotation period of the WD. We suggest that the X-rays are powered by accretion or via the interaction of the WD magnetosphere with CSM. If the rapidly rotating magnetic field could power a weak wind along open field lines, material could be extracted directly from the surface of the WD. Alternatively, accretion of fallback material from the merger or the tidal disruption of a planetary body are possible sources of CSM.",

We derive the stellar mass function (SMF) of quiescent and star-forming galaxies at z <= 0.2 using 12-band optical photometry from the third data release (DR3) of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) over 3,284 deg^2. Methods. We select approximately 890,000 galaxies with r <= 20 mag and photometric redshifts in the range 0.05 <= z  0.95 at log(M*/Msun) > 11. Comparisons with the GAEA semi-analytic model reveal an excess of star-forming galaxies at intermediate masses. Conclusions. J-PLUS DR3 stellar mass functions and quiescent fractions are consistent with the literature and provide robust constraints for galaxy formation models. Quiescent galaxies represent 45 percent of number density above log(M*) > 9, but 75 percent of stellar mass density. The use of 12 optical bands, including 7 narrow filters, improves redshift precision by 20 percent, enabling more accurate SED fitting and galaxy classification.",

        "abstract": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a previously unknown population of compact, red galaxies at $z \\sim 5$, known as \"Little Red Dots\" (LRDs). With effective radii of $\\sim 100$ pc and stellar masses of $10^9-10^{11} \\, \\rm M_\\odot$, a purely stellar interpretation implies extreme central densities, $\\rho_\\star\\sim10^4-10^5 \\, \\rm M_\\odot \\, pc^{-3}$ and in some cases up to $\\sim 10^9 \\, \\rm M_\\odot \\, pc^{-3}$, far exceeding those of globular clusters. At such densities, the dynamical friction time for $10 \\, \\rm M_\\odot$ stars in the central $0.1$ pc is $< 0.1$ Myr, driving rapid mass segregation. We investigate the dynamical consequences of such an environment using: (i) a Fokker-Planck analysis of long-term core evolution, (ii) an analytical model for the collisional growth of a very massive star (VMS), and (iii) direct $N$-body simulations. All approaches show that runaway collisions produce a VMS with mass $9\\times10^3 < M_{\\rm VMS} \\, [\\rm M_\\odot] < 5\\times10^4$ within $<1$ Myr. Once the supply of massive stars is depleted, the VMS contracts on a $\\sim 8000$ yr Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale and undergoes a general relativistic collapse, leaving a massive black hole of mass $M_\\bullet \\sim 10^4 \\, \\rm M_\\odot$. We conclude that LRDs are natural nurseries for the formation of heavy black hole seeds via stellar-dynamical processes. This pathway produces seed number densities that far exceed those expected from direct collapse models, and, owing to the dense residual stellar core, can sustain high rates of tidal disruption events.",

        "abstract": "Cosmic ray (CR) feedback in galaxy evolution has seen a theoretical resurgence in the past decade, but significant uncertainties remain in CR transport through the interstellar and circum-galactic media (ISM and CGM). While several works indicate CR effects may be notable in both star-forming and quenched massive galaxies, modeling the vast CR transport parameter space currently allowed by observations is computationally restrictive to survey. Analytic treatments of CR feedback have provided useful insights to potential ramifications in different regimes, but have relied on time-steady assumptions which may not well characterize CR effects at different cosmic epochs and galaxy mass scales. We present semi-analytic and numerical solutions describing the time-dependent evolution of CR pressure in the CGM under simplified assumptions, which allow for quick evaluation of the vast allowable CR transport parameter space. We demonstrate that time-dependent injection from bursty star formation and/or episodic black hole accretion can substantially alter CR pressure profiles, particularly in the outer halos of massive galaxies ($\\gtrsim R_{vir}$). Our work further suggests that CR feedback may play a significant role in shaping the matter distribution around massive galaxies ($\\gtrsim M_{\\textrm{halo}} \\sim 10^{13} M_\\odot$), and we speculate that these time-dependent effects may connect to observed phenomena like ``Odd Radio Circles\". Finally, we benchmark our semi-analytic formalism against a cosmic ray-magnetohydrodynamic (CR-MHD) cosmological zoom-in galaxy simulation directly modeling the CR scattering rate and emergent transport in full generality, highlighting the validity of our approach. We conclude by motivating careful consideration of time-dependent ``softening\" effects in sub-grid routines for CR feedback, particularly for use in large cosmological volumes.",

We observe the stars over multiple nights and measure radial velocities for each night, which we combine with Gaia proper motions to identify multiplicity and cluster membership. We identify 95 single members, 14 binary members, 9 members with uncertain multiplicity, and 1 single likely member. We determine effective temperatures using empirical color-temperature relations, surface gravities from isochrones, and microturbulence from empirical relations for main-sequence stars. Our sample includes G and K dwarfs with temperatures between 6000 and 5300 K, which expands significantly on earlier observations. We find that lithium abundances in NGC 188 are lower than predictions from standard stellar evolution theory. As expected, stars in NGC 188 are more lithium-depleted than those in the younger Hyades and Praesepe clusters (650 Myr). However, their abundances are higher, or at least comparable, to those in the slightly younger cluster M67 (4.5 Gyr), challenging the idea that older stars have lower lithium than younger ones.

In this study, we present an inference and analysis of the spatially resolved SFH and the MW disc growth. Our approach leverages both stellar birth radii estimates and the complete reconstruction of the MW stellar disc using a novel orbit superposition method from APOGEE data, allowing us to trace the orbit-mass weighted SFH based on formation sites while taking into account stellar mass loss. We find that the MW is a typical disc galaxy exhibiting inside-out formation: it was compact at $z > 2$ ($\\rm R_{\\rm eff} \\approx 2$ kpc), had a peak in its star formation rate (SFR) 9--10 Gyr ago, and grew to a present-day size of $\\rm R_{\\rm eff} \\approx 4.3$ kpc. A secondary peak in SFR $\\sim 4$ Gyr ago is responsible for the onset of the outer disc, which comprises the metal-poor, low-$\\alpha$ population. We find that in-situ star formation in the solar neighbourhood started 8--9 Gyr ago. The MW disc is characterised by a negative mean age gradient, as the result of the inside-out growth, with additional flattening induced by stellar radial migration. Our work showcases the importance of accounting for radial migration and stellar sample selection function when inferring the SFH and build-up of the MW disc.",

Traditional methods, such as spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, can be computationally expensive and may struggle to capture complex galaxy properties. This study aims to develop a robust and efficient machine learning (ML) classification method to identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies within the Farmer COSMOS2020 catalog. We utilized JWST wide-field light cones from the Santa Cruz semi-analytical modeling framework to train a supervised ML model, the CatBoostClassifier, using 28 color features derived from 8 mutual photometric bands within the COSMOS catalog. The model was validated against a testing set and compared to the SED-fitting method in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and execution time. Preprocessing steps included addressing missing data, injecting observational noise, and applying a magnitude cut (ch1 < 26 AB) along with a redshift range of 0.2 < z < 3.5 to align the simulated and observational datasets. The ML method achieved an F1-score of 89\\% for quiescent galaxies, significantly outperforming the SED-fitting method, which achieved 54%. The ML model demonstrated superior recall (88% vs. 38%) while maintaining comparable precision. When applied to the COSMOS2020 catalog, the ML model predicted a systematically higher fraction of quiescent galaxies across all redshift bins within 0.2 < z < 3.5 compared to traditional methods like NUVrJ and SED-fitting. This study shows that ML, combined with multi-wavelength data, can effectively identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies, providing valuable insights into galaxy evolution.

However, there are currently substantial uncertainties in the low-metallicity, low-luminosity thin wind regime where classical diagnostics (H-alpha and ultraviolet, UV, P Cygni profiles) yield wind momenta that are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude below prescriptions implemented by default in most evolutionary models. Here, we present spectra of the mass-loss diagnostic line Br-alpha in 15 OB-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud obtained using the Near Infrared Spectrograph on the James Webb Space Telescope. The line profile morphology, recovered by virtue of the outstanding signal-to-noise ratio of the data and the avoidance of regions with nebular emission, is consistent with predictions based on previous mass-loss rate estimates from optical and UV spectroscopy. Moreover, an initial spectroscopic analysis of sources covering the thin wind regime confirms the low mass-loss rates, indicates a change of slope in the wind-momentum-luminosity relation in this regime with respect to high-luminosity objects, and strengthens the abovementioned discrepancies with commonly used wind-momentum prescriptions.",

        "abstract": "We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark-matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the ${\\rm H}_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M_{\\rm BH} = 10$--$10^5\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ at $z \\approx 20$--$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$--$10^8\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The $M_{\\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of `little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes. Potential future tests of the model are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Not all galaxies at Cosmic Noon evolve in the same way. It remains unclear how the local environment -- especially the extreme overdensities of protoclusters -- affects stellar mass assembly at high redshift. The stellar mass function (SMF) encodes these processes; comparing SMFs across environments reveals differences in evolutionary history. We present the SMF of the Hyperion proto-supercluster at $z\\sim2.5$, one of the largest and most massive protostructures known. This dataset provides the most statistically robust SMF of a single protostructure at $z>2$. By comparing the SMF of overdense peaks within Hyperion to the coeval field, we ask: how early, and how strongly, does a dense environment favor massive galaxies? Using COSMOS2020 photometry with ground-based and new HST grism spectroscopy, we construct a 3D overdensity map that assigns galaxies to peaks, outskirts, or the field. We perform 100 Monte Carlo realizations to propagate redshift and mass uncertainties, and derive SMFs normalized to the field. The peaks show a clear excess of massive galaxies: number densities at $\\log(M_*/M_\\odot)\\sim 11$ are ~10x higher than the field, while those at $\\log(M_*/M_\\odot)\\sim 9.5$ are enhanced by only ~3.5x. By contrast, the outskirts and Hyperion as a whole mirror the field. Environmental effects on stellar mass growth are thus evident by $z\\sim 2.5$. The densest regions already host galaxies with accelerated growth, while the global SMF masks this signal. Protostructures therefore begin shaping the high-mass end of the SMF well before cluster quenching, and may drive the elevated star formation at Cosmic Noon.",

We analyze a suite of over thirty PNG templates, including those used in the _Planck_ analyses of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and resolve their signatures in the deeply nonlinear regime of the late-time density field. Using simulations, we forecast results from a lensing analysis of the Year-10 data from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We find that lensing achieves sensitivity comparable to the CMB for many models, and even surpasses it for templates whose features peak on smaller scales, $k \\gtrsim 0.2 h/{\\rm Mpc}$. Many templates generate non-monotonic behaviors in mass and length scales, providing a distinct phenomenology in the resulting late-time structure. We simulate, for the first time, resonant signatures consistently in both the primordial power spectrum and bispectrum. The constraints on their amplitudes $(A_{\\rm pk}, f_{\\rm NL})$ are essentially independent, as each affects structure formation in distinct ways. Overall, we find that lensing data can provide competitive and complementary constraints on these models, and can deliver leading constraints when the primordial features are predominantly on smaller scales.

In such environments, gravity tends to separate charged species. To prevent separation an electric field, classically described by the Pannekoek-Rosseland expression, is usually imposed externally. Here, we propose a self-consistent method to recover this field based on a multi-mode Fourier expansion of the electrostatic interaction. We show that, under suitable conditions, this approach naturally leads to the ambipolar electric field and restores charge neutrality. The method is tested in both isothermal and multi-temperature plasma configurations. This framework provides a foundation for future developments that may include collisions, ionization, and asymmetric boundary conditions to model more realistic stellar atmospheres.",

Differences in stellar rotation have been proposed as an explanation for the extended main sequence turn-offs and split main sequences in these clusters. In agreement with this idea, we find strong links between the photometric colours of the cluster stars and their projected rotation velocities, Vsini. While stars blueward of the split main sequences are characterized by a range of relatively low spins, those with redder colours are fast rotators. Following a statistical correction for inclination, we measure mean equatorial velocities for the red main-sequence stars in both clusters of V_eq=300 km/s, corresponding to 70-80% of the critical values predicted for such stars by current stellar models. We discuss these findings in the context of the different scenarios proposed to explain the stellar rotation distributions of young massive clusters. We further investigate whether the high rotation rates provide a natural explanation for the high fractions of Be stars we observe in both clusters, peaking at >~50% at the turn-off. We argue that if ~85% of the critical rotation rate is high enough to trigger the formation of a decretion disk, most upper main sequence stars in the clusters are expected to become Be stars before leaving the main sequence.",

For the analysis, we make use of Gammapy, an open-source package for gamma-ray astronomy, and recent models of the Galactic diffuse emission at TeV energies. After subtracting the emission from sources using an algorithm akin to that developed for the foreseen CTAO Galactic plane survey, we find significant remaining emission throughout the Galactic plane. We show the latitudinal and longitudinal flux profiles of the emission in multiple parts of the galaxy taking into account various sources of uncertainty and compare to existing models. We find significant emission beyond 3 degree latitude, consistent in shape with the prediction for the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar gas.

In this study, we simulated the kinematics of an IMBH within the nuclear star cluster of VCC 1861, one of the faintest galaxies in the Virgo Cluster.

        "abstract": "We propose that galaxy structural changes - and the rapid rise of a population of galaxies with early-type morphologies at cosmic noon ($11.5$ as revealed by JWST/NIRCam. The process is at once secular, because the transformative structural changes (heating, compaction, bulge formation) occur over many ($\\approx10-30$) orbital periods, but accelerated, because orbital times were significantly shorter than at the present day. In a first application, we take galaxy effective radius as a proxy for galaxy structure and, using new measurements of the abundance and properties of stellar spirals observed in a collection of JWST deep fields, show that EASE predicts a distribution of early-type sizes that is smaller than late-type galaxies and consistent with what is observed. The success of EASE relies on an updated picture of the influence of spiral arms, in which transience plays a key role. We present a new calculation of the characteristic wave equation in the fluid approximation that applies to steady and non-steady open spirals beyond the more traditional tight-winding limit. This shows open, transient spirals above the Jeans length growing and decaying on the order of a dynamical time in a wider region around and inside corotation than canonical steady spirals. We show that this transient activity spreads out angular momentum gains and losses, and the associated dynamical heating, giving spirals a more extended influence than a single steady spiral. The ubiquity of spirals in star-forming galaxies with $M_*>10^{10.5}M_{\\odot}$ across the redshifts where early-type galaxies appear in large numbers suggests that EASE can play an important role in the morphological transformation of galaxies.",

We consider the stellar age catalog of arXiv:2402.00561, selecting 3,000 of the oldest and most robustly measured main sequence turn-off (MSTO) and subgiant branch (SGB) stars, with ages $>12.5$ Gyr and associated error $ 13$ Gyr, while none exceeds 14.1 Gyr.

Among them, a distinctive set of signatures from \"cosmological collider physics\" originates through interactions of the inflaton with heavy particles active at high energies. The amplitude and form of these signatures depend on the strength and nature of the interactions. The corresponding features in large-scale structure have been studied predominantly through the use of perturbation theory, restricted to the linear regime of the density field. In this work, we implement a method for running cosmological simulations with arbitrary bispectra signals in their initial density field, and produce a simulation suite of over thirty PNG-generating templates, resolving the corresponding collider signatures in the strongly nonlinear regime of the density field. We detail the signals in a variety of late-time measurements -- the matter power spectra, matter bispectra, the halo abundance, and halo bias. We then forecast the potential constraints on the signal amplitudes using weak lensing measurements from the Year-10 dataset of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The second and third moments of the lensing convergence field produce constraints that are competitive and complementary to those from the Cosmic Microwave Background.

Recent hydrodynamic simulations have predicted the nucleosynthetic yields for both carbon-oxygen (CO) and oxygen-neon (ONe) white-dwarf models, but without accounting for thermonuclear reaction-rate uncertainties. We perform detailed Monte Carlo post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations based on updated thermonuclear reaction rates and uncertainties from the 2025 evaluation. We quantify the resulting abundance uncertainties and identify the key nuclear reactions that dominate them. Our results show that both the CO and ONe nova models robustly produce characteristic CNO isotopes. More pronounced abundance differences emerge for elements with A $\\ge$ 20. Sulfur is the most robust observational discriminator between the CO and ONe nova models, with a model-to-model difference of a factor of $\\approx$30 and minimal sensitivity to reaction rate uncertainties. Neon, silicon, and phosphorus exhibit even larger abundance differences (factors of $\\approx$150-250), providing strong diagnostic potential. While their predicted yields are subject to larger uncertainties, these remain smaller than the model-to-model differences, allowing these elements to serve as useful, though less precise, tracers of white-dwarf composition. Chlorine, argon, and potassium also differ between models, but the 1$\\sigma$-abundance ranges for the CO and ONe models overlap, reducing their present usefulness as composition tracers. We find that only nine nuclear reactions dominate the abundance uncertainties of the most diagnostically important isotopes, and their influence is largely independent of the underlying white-dwarf composition.

Among 466 Fermi/GBM sub-threshold events (with reliability >= 5) from 2021 to 2024, 181 are within GECAM's field of view.

Additionally, a complete multi-instrument monitoring and systematic verification of GBM sub-threshold events is expected to further increase the SGRB rate to about 80 per year, which is about 100% improvement relative to the GBM-triggered SGRBs. These results may have important implications on the local formation rate of SGRBs and the binary neutron star merger rate.

Based on cosmological simulations and semi-analytic galaxy formation models, this study explores the detectability of individual nanohertz SMBBH sources using next-generation PTAs and their potential for constraining dark energy under an optimistic scenario considering only the presence of white noise. By constructing light-cone SMBBH populations across hardening timescales ($\\tau_H = 0.1/5/10$Gyr) and computing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), we find advanced PTAs can resolve $10^2$--$10^3$ sources with SNR $> 8$ (primarily at $z < 1$ with chirp masses of $10^8$--$10^{10}M_{\\odot}$). If electromagnetic counterparts can be identified, optimal configurations ($\\sigma_t = 50$ns, $N_p = 1000$, $T_{\\text{obs}} = 30$yr with$ \\tau_H \\leq 5$Gyr) could constrain the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w$ to $\\Delta w \\sim 0.023$--$0.048$, where the constraints only exhibit weak dependence on $\\tau_H$ within $0.1$--$5$Gyr. If only $10\\%$ of GW sources have detectable electromagnetic counterparts, constraints weaken to $\\Delta w = 0.075$ ($\\tau_H = 0.1$Gyr) and $\\Delta w = 0.162$ ($\\tau_H = 5$Gyr) under the most optimal parameter configuration. What's more, conservative PTAs ($N_p = 500$, $\\sigma_t = 100$--$200$ns) with additional $30$-year data accumulation could double resolvable source counts and improve $\\Delta w$ precision by $\\sim 40\\%$.",

        "abstract": "General relativity, treated as a low-energy effective field theory, predicts quantum corrections to Newton's law of gravitation arising from loops of matter and graviton fields. While these corrections are utterly negligible when considering the Standard Model particle content, the situation changes dramatically in the presence of a hidden or dark sector containing a very large number of light degrees of freedom. In such cases, loop-induced modifications to the Newtonian potential can accumulate to levels testable in laboratory and astrophysical probes of gravity at short distances. In this work we systematically derive and constrain the impact of large dark sectors on precision tests of Newton's law, translating effective field theory predictions into the experimental language of Yukawa-type deviations and inverse-square law deformations. By mapping precision fifth-force constraints onto bounds on species multiplicities and masses, we show that current and future experiments already impose nontrivial constraints on the size and structure of hidden sectors coupled only gravitationally. Our results provide a model-independent framework for confronting dark-sector scenarios with precision gravity data, and highlight the complementarity of particle physics and short-distance gravitational tests in probing new physics beyond the Standard Model.",

        "abstract": "The fifth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V) includes the first large-scale spectroscopic survey of white dwarfs (WDs) in the era of Gaia parallaxes. SDSS-V collects multiple exposures per target, making it ideal for binary detection. We present a search for hydrogen atmosphere (DA) double white dwarf (DWD) binaries in this rich dataset. We quantify radial velocity variations between sub-exposures to identify binary candidates, and also measure the orbital period for a subset of DWD binary candidates. We find 63 DWD binary candidates, of which 43 are new discoveries, and we provide tentative periods for 10 binary systems. Using these measurements, we place constraints on the binary fraction of the Galactic WD population with $< 0.4$ AU separations $f_{\\mathrm{bin,0.4}} = 9\\%$, and the power-law index of the initial separation distribution $\\alpha = -0.62$. Using the simulated binary population, we estimate that $\\leq 10$ super-Chandrasekhar binaries that merge within a Hubble time are expected in our sample. We predict that $\\leq 5$ systems in our sample should be detectable via gravitational waves by LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), one of which has already been identified as a LISA verification source. We also estimate a total of about 10,000 - 20,000 LISA-detectable DWD binaries in the galaxy. Our catalog of WD+WD binary candidates in SDSS-V is now public, and promises to uncover a large number of exciting DWD systems.",

PUFFINS plans to observe 70 UV bright target stars at varying distances within a 180-320 nm wavelength range with 0.02% polarimetric accuracy. PUFFINS uses a simple telescope design with all reflective optics coated with protected aluminum to enhance reflectivity in the UV. The telescope and the spectropolarimeter, which consists of a Wollaston prism and a half-wave retarder, have been carefully selected to be greater than Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL6). The telescope is designed to exhibit negligible instrumental polarization and crosstalk, significantly reducing the time needed for polarimetric calibration in orbit. The optimum and careful selection of the target stars will enable PUFFINS to observe an expanded and well-defined sample to test the predictions by interstellar grain alignment theory in the observation phase of 9 months. This paper outlines the details of the optical and optomechanical design and evaluates the polarimetric performance of PUFFINS.",

        "abstract": "The real nature of little red dots (LRDs), a class of very compact galaxies in the early Universe recently discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, is still poorly understood. The most popular theories competing to interpret the phenomena include active galactic nuclei and enhanced star formation in dusty galaxies. To date, however, neither model gives a completely satisfactory explanation to the population as a whole; thus, alternative theories have arisen, including tidal disruption events (TDEs). By considering observational constraints on the radio emission of LRDs, we discuss whether TDEs are adequate alternatives solving these high-redshift enigmas. We utilise radio flux density upper limits from LRD stacking analyses, TDE peak radio luminosities, and volumetric density estimates. We find that the characteristic values of flux densities and luminosities allow radio-quiet TDEs as the underlying process of LRDs in any case, while the less common radio-loud TDEs are compatible with the model under special constraints only. Considering other factors, such as volumetric density estimates, delayed and long-term radio flares of TDEs, and cosmological time dilation, TDEs appear to be a plausible explanation for LRDs from the radio point of view.",

        "abstract": "One of the scenarios for bar formation in galaxies involves their interaction with a more massive companion. The stellar component is then transformed from a disk into a bar-like prolate spheroid. I investigated a subsample of 77 bar-like galaxies tidally induced in the cluster environment, selected among the previously studied sample of bar-like galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulations. I present six clear, convincing examples of bar-like galaxies formed after an interaction with a progenitor of a massive brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and describe the properties of their bars. For the whole sample, the time of bar formation is strongly correlated with and typically slightly greater than the time of the pericenter passage. All galaxies are strongly stripped of dark matter and gas, and their rotation is similarly diminished. A larger pericenter distance typically requires a higher host mass in order to transform the galaxy, but the interactions show no preference for prograde configurations. The final strength of the bars does not correlate with the amount of tidal stripping experienced because of the variety of initial properties of the progenitors and the subsequent evolution over the next pericenter passages. In spite of difficulties in the interpretation of some cases involving mergers and multiple interactions, the results confirm in the cosmological context the reality of tidal bar formation in cluster environments previously studied using controlled simulations.",

        "abstract": "[abridged] Accurately accounting for the AGN phase in galaxy evolution requires a large, clean AGN sample. This is now possible with SRG/eROSITA. The public Data Release 1 (DR1, Jan 31, 2024) includes 930,203 sources from the Western Galactic Hemisphere. The data enable the selection of a large AGN sample and the discovery of rare sources. However, scientific return depends on accurate characterisation of the X-ray emitters, requiring high-quality multiwavelength data. This paper presents the identification and classification of optical and infrared counterparts to eRASS1 sources using Gaia DR3, CatWISE2020, and Legacy Survey DR10 (LS10) with the Bayesian NWAY algorithm and trained priors. Sources were classified as Galactic or extragalactic via a Machine Learning model combining optical/IR and X-ray properties, trained on a reference sample. For extragalactic LS10 sources, photometric redshifts were computed using Circlez. Within the LS10 footprint, all 656,614 eROSITA/DR1 sources have at least one possible optical counterpart; about 570,000 are extragalactic and likely AGN. Half are new detections compared to AllWISE, Gaia, and Quaia AGN catalogues. Gaia and CatWISE2020 counterparts are less reliable, due to the surveys shallowness and the limited amount of features available to assess the probability of being an X-ray emitter. In the Galactic Plane, where the overdensity of stellar sources also increases the chance of associations, using conservative reliability cuts, we identify approximately 18,000 Gaia and 55,000 CatWISE2020 extragalactic sources. We release three high-quality counterpart catalogues, plus the training and validation sets, as a benchmark for the field. These datasets have many applications, but in particular empower researchers to build AGN samples tailored for completeness and purity, accelerating the hunt for the Universe most energetic engines.",

        "abstract": "We explore the role of color superconductivity in quarkyonic matter under the conditions of color and electric neutrality at $\\beta$- and strong equilibrium, as relevant for neutron stars. By explicitly incorporating the color-superconducting pairing gap into the phenomenological model of a smooth transition from hadron to quark matter, we extend the known quarkyonic framework to include this essential aspect relevant at high densities. The momentum dependence of the pairing gap, motivated by the running of the QCD coupling and introduced similarly to chiral quark models with nonlocal interaction, is a novel element of the model that is crucial for enabling the simultaneous onset of all color-flavor quark states in the presence of color superconductivity. While asymptotically conformal behavior of the present model is ensured by construction, we demonstrate that reaching the conformal limit in agreement with the predictions of perturbative QCD is provided by the proper momentum dependence of the thickness of the hadron shell in momentum space. We employ the flexible meta-modeling approach to nuclear matter, analyzing the structure of the hadron shell in momentum space and focusing on the effects of color superconductivity in quarkyonic matter. Similar to the effects induced by the onset of the quarkyonic phase, color superconductivity leads to stiffening of the equation of state of the NS matter. This causes a significant impact on observable properties of neutron stars, which are analyzed and compared to recent astrophysical and theoretical constraints. We argue that the developed model of color-superconducting quarkyonic matter provides a new, consistent tool for studying the scenario of smooth quark-hadron transition in NSs.",

We present here a summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer 2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students.

        "abstract": "Local distance indicators such as standard sirens, in combination with spectroscopic redshift measurements of their host galaxies, allow us to estimate the present-day expansion rate of the Universe parameterised by Hubble's constant, H_0. However, these observed redshifts are systematically modified by the effect of galaxy peculiar velocities. Although these velocities may be estimated from the local density field by the process of velocity-field reconstruction, the intrinsic errors and covariance in these estimates contribute to the error in the H_0 determination. In this paper we demonstrate how the impact of peculiar velocities can be propagated into H_0 measurements from local distance indicators with observed redshifts, incorporating the full covariance of the velocity field induced by bulk flows. We apply our methods to cosmological simulations, testing the importance of this effect in the context of future analyses of gravitational wave sources with electromagnetic counterparts used as bright sirens. We conclude that H_0 errors may be increased by up to a factor of 2 in comparison with neglecting peculiar velocity covariance, with the highest impacts expected for sources at nearby distances or with small distance errors. Our analytical methods may also be applied to other local distance indicators, such as Type Ia supernovae.",

We consider the \"projected-field\" kSZ estimator, which involves cross-correlating a foreground-cleaned, filtered, squared CMB temperature map with an LSS tracer, and requires no individual tracer redshifts. We compare $\\verb|class_sz|$ halo model calculations of projected-field kSZ cross-correlations with measurements of these signals from the Websky numerical simulations. We cross-correlate halo density maps from Websky with various CMB secondary signals. We first validate our halo model by comparing its predictions for thermal SZ (tSZ) and patchy screening ($\\tau$) cross-correlations to measurements of these signals from Websky. We consider three different halo redshift ranges in our comparisons. We also construct our own kSZ, tSZ, and $\\tau$ maps to validate the form of the relevant profiles. Following the tSZ and $\\tau$ validation, we compare projected-field kSZ calculations between the halo model and the simulations. We use filters constructed for $\\textit{Planck}$ and the Simons Observatory (SO) to assess the accuracy of the halo-model kSZ predictions for experiments of differing sensitivity. Overall, we find good agreement, particularly at $\\textit{Planck}$ sensitivity. However, we find an $\\approx$ 20$\\%$ difference between our halo model and the simulations for SO, which significantly exceeds the predicted error bars. We note that our halo model includes only the dominant expected term in the projected-field kSZ signal; the magnitude of the difference between our model and the simulations is consistent with previous predictions for terms arising from other contractions in the theory calculation. These terms will need to be included to obtain unbiased inference from upcoming projected-field kSZ measurements.",

We investigate the implications of this measurement for the origin of nucleon mass within the parity doublet model framework, which naturally incorporates both chiral variant and chiral invariant mass components. We construct unified equations of state by employing the parity doublet model with isovector scalar meson $a_0(980)$ for hadronic matter up to twice nuclear saturation density, smoothly connected to a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-type quark model at higher densities through a crossover transition. By systematically varying the chiral invariant mass $m_0$ and quark matter parameters, we determine which values simultaneously satisfy all current astrophysical constraints, including gravitational wave observations from GW170817, NICER measurements of several pulsars, and the existence of two-solar-mass neutron stars. The inclusion of PSR J0614-3329 dramatically refines the allowed range of the chiral invariant mass from the previous constraint of $580~\\text{MeV} \\lesssim m_0 \\lesssim 860~\\text{MeV}$ to $800~\\text{MeV} \\lesssim m_0 \\lesssim 860~\\text{MeV}$, raising the lower bound by approximately 220 MeV.

To constrain the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its past dynamical evolution, we propagate the orbits of 3I/ATLAS and nearby stars to search for stellar encounters. Integrating orbits in the Galactic potential and propagating the astrometric and radial-velocity uncertainties of 30 million Gaia stars, we identify 25 encounters with median encounter distances less than 1 pc. However, because the encounter speeds between 3I/ATLAS and each encounter exceed 20 km/s, none is a plausible host under common ejection mechanisms. We infer stellar masses for most stars and quantify the gravitational perturbations exerted by each individual star or each binary system on 3I/ATLAS. The strongest gravitational scattering perturber is a wide M-dwarf binary. Among all past encounters, the binary's barycenter and 3I/ATLAS reach the small encounter distance of 0.242 pc and the encounter speed of 28.39 km/s,1.64 Myr ago. We further demonstrate that the cumulative influence of the stellar encounters on both the speed and direction of 3I/ATLAS is weak. Based on the present kinematics of 3I/ATLAS to assess its origin, we find that a thin-disk origin is strongly favored, because the thin disk both exhibits a velocity distribution closely matching that of 3I/ATLAS and provides the dominant local number density of stars.",

Comprehensive studies of intensive multi-wavelength monitoring and surveys of local and high-redshift AGNs have shown that X-ray illumination of AGN accretion discs is a potential explanation for the observed variability. Our main objective is to study the UV/optical power spectra of AGNs under the assumption of X-ray reverberation and to test whether this model can explain the observed power spectra of distant quasars. To do this, we computed the disc transfer function in the case of X-ray reverberation using a recent physical model and studied its dependence on the parameters of the model. This model allows us to explore the variability of X-ray illuminated discs under the scenario in which the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion process or by an external source. We then calculated UV/optical power spectra using the disc transfer function and assuming a bending power law for the X-ray power spectrum. We fitted our models to the observed power spectra of quasars determined by a recent power spectrum analysis of the SDSS Stripe-82 light curves. We demonstrate that X-ray reverberation can fit the power spectra of quasars in our sample well at all wavelengths, from $\\sim 1300$\\AA\\ up to $4000$\\AA. Our best-fit models imply that the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion disc, and that the black hole spin is probably lower than 0.7, while the X-ray corona height is in the range of $20 - 60 R_{g}$. This is in agreement with previous findings from the application of the X-ray reverberation model to the quasar micro-lensing disc size problem, as well as recent time-lag measurements.",

Such systems are not amenable to the standard techniques of perturbation theory and orbit-averaging. Modelling the evolution of these triples as a sequence of impulses at the outer pericentre, we show that such triples lend themselves to a description as a correlated random walk of the inner binary's eccentricity and angular-momentum vector, going beyond the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism. The outer orbit is seen to excite the inner eccentricity arbitrarily close to unity, eventually. These quasi-hierarchical triples constitute, therefore, a natural mechanism for creating highly eccentric binaries. We discuss applications for gravitational-wave mergers engendered by this process, and show that for a large portion of the parameter space, the time-to-coalescence is significantly reduced.",

        "abstract": "Blueshifted absorption is the classic spectroscopic signature of an accretion disc wind in X-ray binaries and cataclysmic variables (CVs). However, outflows can also create pure emission lines, especially at optical wavelengths. Therefore, developing other outflow diagnostics for these types of lines is worthwhile. With this in mind, we construct a systematic grid of 3645 synthetic wind-formed H-alpha line profiles for CVs with the radiative transfer code SIROCCO. Our grid yields a variety of line shapes: symmetric, asymmetric, single- to quadruple-peaked, and even P-Cygni profiles. About 20% of these lines -- our `Gold' sample -- have strengths and widths consistent with observations. We use this grid to test a recently proposed method for identifying wind-formed emission lines based on deviations in the wing profile shape: the `excess equivalent width diagnostic diagram'. We find that our `Gold' sample can preferentially populate the suggested `wind regions' of this diagram. However, the method is highly sensitive to the adopted definition of the line profile `wing'. Hence, we propose a refined definition based on the full-width at half maximum to improve the interpretability of the diagnostic diagram. Furthermore, we define an approximate scaling relation for the strengths of wind-formed CV emission lines in terms of the outflow parameters. This relation provides a fast way to assess whether -- and what kind of -- outflow can produce an observed emission line. All our wind-based models are open-source and we provide an easy-to-use web-based tool to browse our full set of H-alpha spectral profiles.",

We show that the imaginary part of all one-loop wavefunction coefficients is universally fixed in terms of the logarithmic running of the real part, under the assumptions of scale invariance, Bunch-Davies vacuum and light bulk fields. Our work resolves discrepancies in the literature, establishes regulator-independent predictions for the imaginary part at one loop, and provides a practical framework for computing quantum contributions to cosmological correlators.",

Focusing on the dry and wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals, we establish the theoretical expectation of these observables in each formation channel.

We investigate whether the introduction of three additional torsion-dependent terms in Einstein frame help to realize a bounce. We first explore this cosmological system in the background of a homogeneous and isotropic FRW spacetime but inclusion of the torsion terms are insufficient to produce a bounce in this symmetric setting. Motivated by this limitation, we relax the symmetry and generalize the background to include inhomogeneity and anisotropy. In this setup, the dynamics is modified in such a way that a bouncing solution is possible without invoking phantom fields or energy condition violations.

While our $M_{\\rm BH}$ estimate is fully consistent with the previous determination, the $I$-band mass-to-light ratio is lower by 10%.

Roman should be sensitive to lenses with mass down to ~ 0.02 $M_{\\oplus}$, or roughly the mass of Ganymede. Thus the detection of moons with masses similar to the giant moons in our Solar System is possible with Roman. Measuring the demographics of exomoons will provide constraints on both moon and planet formation. We conduct simulations of Roman microlensing events to determine the effects of exomoons on microlensing light curves, and whether these effects are detectable with Roman. We focus on giant planets from 30 $M_{\\oplus}$ to 10 $M_{Jup}$ on orbits from 0.3 to 30 AU, and assume that each planet is orbited by a moon with moon-planet mass ratio from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}$ and separations from 0.1 to 0.5 planet Hill radii. We find that Roman is sensitive to exomoons, although the number of expected detections is only of order one over the duration of the survey, unless exomoons are more common or massive than we assumed. We argue that changes in the survey strategy, in particular focusing on a few fields with higher cadence, may allow for the detection of more exomoons with Roman. Regardless, the ability to detect exomoons reinforces the need to develop robust methods for modeling triple lens microlensing events to fully utilize the capabilities of Roman.",

Yet their capabilities in scientific imaging, especially on unfamiliar and potentially previously unseen data distributions, remain poorly understood. In this work, we assess whether generic VLMs, presumed to lack exposure to astronomical corpora, can perform morphology-based classification of radio galaxies using the MiraBest FR-I/FR-II dataset. We explore prompting strategies using natural language and schematic diagrams, and, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce visual in-context examples within prompts in astronomy. Additionally, we evaluate lightweight supervised adaptation via LoRA fine-tuning. Our findings reveal three trends: (i) even prompt-based approaches can achieve good performance, suggesting that VLMs encode useful priors for unfamiliar scientific domains; (ii) however, outputs are highly unstable, i.e. varying sharply with superficial prompt changes such as layout, ordering, or decoding temperature, even when semantic content is held constant; and (iii) with just 15M trainable parameters and no astronomy-specific pretraining, fine-tuned Qwen-VL achieves near state-of-the-art performance (3% Error rate), rivaling domain-specific models. These results suggest that the apparent \"reasoning\" of VLMs often reflects prompt sensitivity rather than genuine inference, raising caution for their use in scientific domains. At the same time, with minimal adaptation, generic VLMs can rival specialized models, offering a promising but fragile tool for scientific discovery.",

Until now, no direct observations have confirmed their role in the heating of the atmosphere. Here, we present the first direct evidence that solar vortices act as structured waveguides, carrying magnetoacoustic modes (waves that behave like sound waves but travel through magnetized plasma) that leave clear wave-heating signatures. By mapping vortex regions at multiple heights and analysing the waves they contain, we show that magnetoacoustic waves efficiently transfer energy, offset losses from radiation, and dominate energy transport in the lower chromosphere. These results challenge the long-standing assumption that vortices primarily support twisting disturbances traveling along magnetic field lines (Alfven waves), revealing instead that magnetoacoustic modes play the leading role in the lower atmosphere. This redefines the role of vortices in magnetized plasmas and has broader implications for wave-plasma interactions in regions of strong magnetic fields.",

AB Aurigae is a complex and visually stunning system, surrounded by a gas rich protoplanetary disk showing numerous spiral arms, an enigmatic embedded protoplanet (AB Aurigae b) at 0\\farcs{}6 separation, and hints of potential additional sites of planet formation. Even a marginally-successful dark hole generation (e.g. 10$^{-5}$--10$^{-6}$ contrast) with CGI would yield a vastly improved view of AB Aur b at optical wavelengths where current ground-based and HST data struggle to yield a high SNR detection and parameters (astrometry, photometry) unbiased by processing artifacts. Total intensity imaging and polarimetry together will provide new constraints on the disk's dust properties and the range of emission sources for AB Aur b. AB Aur images with the Roman Coronagraph will provide a striking, inspiring demonstrations of the instrument's power and promise for detecting fainter planets and disks.",

        "abstract": "To fulfill the requirements of space object cataloging and enable automated intelligent responses to anomalous events, we designed a novel observation scheduling system named Sky Survey Schedule (SSS). This framework facilitates coordinated operations across multi-site observational networks comprising dozens of instruments, while simultaneously supporting asteroid monitoring and time-domain astronomy studies. The system implements two principal observation modes: fixed sky regions and target-centered tracking. The former is used for sidereal or static observation, while the latter provides dedicated follow-up capabilities for transient targets. The sky regions are divided into latitude bands, each of which is subdivided into sectors to ensure minimal overlap and comprehensive coverage. These sectors are mapped to high-level HEALPix sky grids, enabling rapid cross-referencing and correlation between instruments. At the core of SSS lies an adaptive weighting architecture that integrates multiple parameters. Initial target priorities are determined from orbital catalogs containing both known and uncorrelated objects according to cataloging requirements. The system implements dynamic weight adjustments through feedback mechanisms: confirmed stable objects receive decaying weights, long-unobserved targets experience weight recovery, while anomalies (e.g., newly detected or lost objects) trigger priority escalation. These target-specific weights combine with observational factors - including phase angle constraints, lunar interference, Earth shadowing, and elevation limits - to generate space-time priority matrices. This quantitative framework systematically incorporates operator-defined priorities for specific regions/targets through configurable weight modifiers. Observation plans are dynamically optimized considering:....",

All of the 25 sources analyzed here have previously been observed with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to probe their subparsec projected physical scales, but detected emission has only been measured for 12 of the sources at $C$ band (4.4 GHz), despite expectations. We determined that coronal emission is unlikely to be a dominant emission mechanism for the sources not detected by the VLBA, and the emission measured with the VLA is likely produced beyond parsec spatial scales. We also explore potential radiation mechanisms for the circumnuclear radio emission that is produced beyond the observable ~parsec physical scales probed with the VLBA but within the $\\leq30-110$ parsec spatial scales observed with the VLA. From an energetics perspective, we find that all targets have extranuclear radio emission that is compatible with AGN winds, assuming a maximum of 10% of the bolometric output can supply the mechanical energy observed. We also find that the excess emission is likely too strong for star formation alone when compared to results from optical spectroscopy, but may contribute in smaller capacities.",

The recently proposed family tree decomposition technique solved these time integrals in terms of canonical objects called family trees, which are multivariate hypergeometric functions with energies as variables and twists as parameters. In this work, we provide a systematic study of the analytical properties of family trees. By exploiting the great flexibility of Mellin representations of family trees, we identify and characterize all their singularities in both variables and parameters and find their exact series representations around all singularities with finite convergent domains. These series automatically generate analytical continuation of arbitrary family trees over many distinct regions in the energy space. As a corollary, we show the factorization of family trees at zero partial-energy singularities to all orders. Our findings offer essential analytical data for further understanding and computing cosmological correlators.",

        "abstract": "One of the most surprising results of early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations is the discovery of an abundance of red, compact, broad-line objects dubbed \"little red dots\" (LRDs) at $z>4$. Their spatial density ($\\sim10^{-4}$-$10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$) is 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars at those redshift if one extrapolates the quasar luminosity function (QLF) down to the LRD regime. However, whether LRDs dominate black hole accretion at quasar-like luminosities ($L_\\mathrm{bol}\\gtrsim 10^{45-46}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$) remains unanswered, as probing the bright end of the LRD luminosity function requires a much larger area than those able to be surveyed by JWST. In this work, we present our search for the brightest LRDs ($K<23.7$) at $4.5<4.9$ using wide-area multiwavelength imaging surveys from the near-UV to the infrared bands. With over 15 square degrees of sky coverage, we only identify one single LRD candidate at $z_\\mathrm{phot}\\approx4.6$, which translates into a spatial density of $n(M_{5100}<-23.5)\\approx10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ -- this is nearly 10 times less abundant than the UV-selected quasars at similar optical luminosity. When combined with the LRD sample identified by JWST at the same redshift range, we find a sharp cutoff in the optical luminosity function at $\\lambda L_{5100}\\approx2.5\\times10^{44}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$, while the QLF turnover occurs at $\\gtrsim20$ times higher luminosity. We therefore confirm the exclusively low-luminosity nature of LRDs, ruling out that LRDs are the counter parts of quasars. Furthermore, we speculate that, if the shape of the luminosity function holds up, it points to LRDs being powered by low-mass black holes with a narrow range of Eddington-level accretion rates.",

In particular, Hubble residuals display a luminosity shift based on host mass, known as the mass step, which is often used as an extra correction in the standardisation of SN Ia luminosities. Here we investigate Hubble residuals and the mass step in the context of Si II $\\lambda 6355$ velocities, using 277 near-peak SNe Ia from ZTF DR2. We divide the sample into high-velocity (HV) and normal-velocity (NV) SNe Ia, separated at 12,000 km/s, resulting in 70 HV and 207 NV objects. We then examine links between Si II $\\lambda$6355 velocities, light-curve stretch $x_{1}$, colour $c$, and host properties to explore potential environmental and/or progenitor-related effects. Although we only find a marginal difference between the Hubble residuals of HV and NV SNe Ia, the NV mass step is $0.149 \\pm 0.024$ mag ($6.3\\sigma$), while HV SNe Ia show $0.046 \\pm 0.041$ mag ($1.1\\sigma$), consistent with zero. The NV-HV mass-step difference is $\\sim 2.2\\sigma$. The clearest subtype difference is seen in central regions ($d_{DLR}  1$), while NV SNe show stronger environmental trends. Thus, NV SNe Ia appear more environmentally sensitive, especially in central, likely metal-rich and older regions, while HV SNe Ia show weaker, subset-dependent trends, and applying a universal mass-step correction could introduce biases. Refined classifications or environment-dependent factors may improve future cosmological analyses beyond standard $x_{1}$ and $c$ cuts.",

Pole-on discs, especially faint debris discs, are difficult to detect and require careful consideration during post-processing to remove stellar residuals from the data while preserving the disc signal. Reference-star differential imaging (RDI) serves as one of the primary post-processing methods for disc observations. We aim to develop a method of reference frame selection that is optimised for the reduction of pole-on discs. Method: We performed principal component analysis based RDI on seven known disc targets and 20 disc-free targets with varying observational conditions, using reference libraries built from frames preselected to best match different observational, atmospheric, and stellar parameters of the science frames. The contrast of the disc-free reductions was measured, and forward modelling was used to estimate the signal loss from over-subtraction using synthetic pole-on discs with two different widths and four different radii. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the real disc targets was measured. Results: Diverse reference libraries built using subsets of frames that closely matched different parameters achieved the best disc S/N and smallest deviation from the best contrast of each target, outperforming libraries built using a single criterion as a selection metric. Libraries built using frame-to-frame Pearson correlation coefficient alone as a selection criterion achieved the best mean contrast overall. Both selection metrics performed consistently well for all disc radii and observational conditions. We also found that reference libraries built using frames observed close in time to the science frame performed well for discs at small separations, giving the best contrast for ~30% of the targets at a radius of 20px.",

Our analysis reveals a fundamental tension between early- and late-universe constraints within both frameworks: ACT favors a quintom scenario where the dark energy equation of state (EoS) evolves from $w>-1$ at early times to $w-1$ across cosmic evolution. The joint analysis yields constraints that align more closely with the ACT preference. Critically, the canonical RDE model fails to provide a coherent description of cosmic evolution, as it manifests severe tensions (even exceeding $10\\sigma$ significance) between early- and late-universe parameter reconstructions. Based on the combined data, Bayesian evidence decisively disfavors both HDE and RDE models relative to the $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, with ACT providing decisive disfavor and DESI+DESY5 yielding moderate disfavor. Our results show that the HDE and RDE models remain excluded by the new data, reinforcing earlier conclusions drawn from previous datasets.",

LHS allows for various optimization strategies, most notably to ensure space-filling properties. However, LHS is a single-stage algorithm that requires a priori knowledge of the targeted sample size. In this work, we present LHS in LHS, a new expansion algorithm for LHS that enables the addition of new samples to an existing LHS-distributed set while (approximately) preserving its properties. In summary, the algorithm identifies regions of the parameter space that are far from the initial set, draws a new LHS within those regions, and then merges it with the original samples. As a by-product, we introduce a new metric, the LHS degree, which quantifies the deviation of a given design from an LHS distribution. Our public implementation is distributed via the Python package expandLHS.",

To describe this phenomenon, a temporal coarse-graining formalism was developed (Barbieri et al. 2024b). In this work, we generalize that approach to cover regimes where the timescales of temperature fluctuations are comparable to or exceed the electron crossing time. We derive a set of kinetic equations that incorporate an additional term arising from the coarse-graining procedure, which was not present in the earlier formulation. Through numerical simulations, we analyze the plasma dynamics under these broader conditions, showing that the electric field influences the system when fluctuation timescales approach the electron crossing time. However, for timescales much larger than the proton crossing time, the electric field becomes negligible. The observed behaviours are interpreted within the framework of the extended temporal coarse-graining theory, and we identify the regimes and conditions in which temperature inversion persists.",

        "abstract": "The corona is a crucial region that connects the solar surface to the solar wind and serves as the primary site of solar activity. The 2024 total solar eclipse (TSE) provides a unique opportunity to investigate the large-scale coronal structure. Combined with TSE observations, we study the impact of the magnetic structure of the far-side active region, located in the eastern hemisphere of the Sun that has not yet rotated into the Earth Field-of-View (FoV), on a global Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. To address the limitation of single-view measurements in the routine synoptic map, we correct the magnetic field in the far-side region by incorporating full-disk magnetograms measured several days after the TSE, allowing us to capture the temporal evolution of the photospheric magnetic field in near real-time. Simulation results demonstrate that the local magnetic field in the far-side active region can significantly influence the global coronal structure by altering the position of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS), and further affect the global distribution of plasma parameters, even in polar regions. A comparison of the simulation results with white-light (WL) TSE + LASCO C2 observations and in situ measurements by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) reveals that the composite synoptic map improves the accuracy of coronal modeling. This work provides robust support for advancing our understanding of coronal evolution, as well as deepens the link between the photosphere and large-scale coronal structure. Furthermore, it establishes a theoretical foundation for the future development of multi-view, stereoscopic measurements of the photospheric magnetic field.",

        "abstract": "The 2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics tasked future space observatories with the goal of detecting and characterizing a large sample of Earth-like exoplanets. To achieve this, these observatories will require coronagraphs and wavefront control algorithms in order to achieve $10^{-10}$ or better starlight suppression. The Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB) is a vacuum compatible testbed at the University of Arizona which aims to advance and mature starlight suppression technologies in a space-like environment. In its current configuration, SCoOB is a charge-6 vector vortex coronagraph outfitted with a Kilo-C microelectromechanical systems deformable mirror capable of achieving sub-$10^{-8}$ dark hole contrast at visible wavelengths using implicit electric field conjugation (iEFC). In this work, we demonstrate the use of a self-coherent camera (SCC) for dark hole digging and maintenance on SCoOB. The SCC introduces a small off-axis pinhole in the Lyot plane which allows some starlight to reach the focal plane and interfere with residual speckles. This enables high-order focal-plane wavefront sensing which can be combined with active wavefront control to null the speckles in a specified region of high contrast known as the dark hole. We discuss considerations for implementation, potential limitations, and provide a performance comparison with iEFC. We also discuss the design optimization and fabrication process for our SCC Lyot stops.",

The detection of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O in hot molecular cores suggests that the possible existence of larger ring-shaped molecules containing more than three carbon atoms, such as furan (c-C$_{4}$H$_{4}$O), which shares structural similarities with ribose (C$_{5}$H$_{10}$O5), the sugar component of DNA. In this study, we report the first detection of the rotational emission lines of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O and CH$_{3}$CHO towards the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, based on observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in band 7. The fractional abundances of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O and CH$_{3}$CHO relative to H$_{2}$ are $(2.1\\pm0.2)\\times10^{-9}$ and $(7.1\\pm0.9)\\times10^{-9}$, respectively. The column density ratio between CH$_{3}$CHO and c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O is $3.4\\pm0.7$. A Pearson correlation heat map reveals strong positive correlations ($r$ $>$ 0.5) between the abundances and excitation temperatures of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O and CH$_{3}$CHO, suggesting a possible chemical connection between those two molecules. To investigate this further, we conducted a two-phase warm-up chemical model using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. A comparison between our derived abundances and the predictions from our chemical model and existence model demonstrates good agreement within factors of 0.73 and 0.74, respectively. We propose that c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O may form in G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 via the grain surface reaction between C$_{2}$H$_{4}$ and O, but CH$_{3}$CHO may be produced through the surface reaction between CH$_{3}$ and HCO.",

However, existing methods often fail to capture fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.   We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable parameters.   Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster inference performance suitable for practical deployment.",

Specifically, solar energetic electrons (SEEs) measured in situ can be linked to solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which can be observed remotely in radio, optical, UV and X-rays. Solar Orbiter, equipped with a wide range of remote-sensing and in situ detectors, provides an excellent opportunity to investigate SEEs and their solar origin from the inner heliosphere. The Comprehensive Solar Energetic Electron event Catalogue (CoSEE-Cat) provides details for all SEE events measured in situ by Solar Orbiter, as well as associated flares, CMEs, and radio bursts. The catalogue contains key parameters of the SEEs, as derived from the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD), complemented with basic parameters of associated X-ray flares provided by STIX, information on eruptive phenomena seen by EUI, characteristics of type III radio bursts observed by RPW, and indications of CME observed by Metis and SoloHI. The conditions in interplanetary space were characterised using SWA and MAG measurements. Finally, data-driven modelling with the Magnetic Connectivity Tool provided an independent estimate of the solar source position of the SEEs. The first data release contains 303 SEE events observed from November 2020 until the end of 2022. In this paper, we describe the catalogue and provide a first statistical analysis. Preliminary results support the flare-related origin of events with an impulsive ion composition and the association of gradual events with extended structures such as CME-driven shocks or erupting flux ropes. We also show that the commonly observed delays of the solar release times of the SEEs relative to the associated X-ray flares and type III radio bursts are at least partially due to propagation effects.",

        "abstract": "We describe some properties of the hyperbolically symmetric black hole (hereafter referred to as the $HSBH$) proposed a few years ago. We start by explaining the main motivation behind such an idea, and we determine the main differences between this scenario and the classical black hole (hereafter referred to as the $CBH$) scenario. Particularly important are the facts that, in the $HSBH$ scenario, (i) test particles in the region inside the horizon experience a repulsive force that prevents them from reaching the center, (ii) test particles may cross the horizon outward only along the symmetry axis, and (iii) the spacetime within the horizon is static but not spherically symmetric. Next, we examine the differences between the two models of black holes in light of the Landauer principle and the Hawking results on the eventual evaporation of the black hole and the paradox resulting thereof. Finally, we explore what observational signature could be invoked to confirm or dismiss the model.",

        "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short-duration and energetic radio transients of unknown origin. Observationally, they are commonly categorized into repeaters and non-repeaters. However, this binary classification may be influenced by observational limitations such as sensitivity and time coverage of telescopes. In this work, we employ unsupervised machine learning techniques to re-examine the CHIME/FRB catalog, with the goal of identifying intrinsic groupings in the FRB population without relying on preassigned labels. Using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for dimensionality reduction and hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN) for clustering, we find that the FRB sample separates naturally into two major clusters. One cluster contains nearly all known repeaters but is contaminated by some apparently non-repeaters, while the other cluster is dominated by non-repeaters. This suggests that certain FRBs previously labeled as non-repeaters may share intrinsic similarities with repeaters. The mutual information analysis reveals that rest-frame frequency width and peak frequency are the most informative features governing the clustering structure. Even when reducing the input space to just these two features, the classification remains robust.",

        "abstract": "We present a detailed multi-wavelength afterglow study of the short GRB 250704B, extensively monitored in optical and near-infrared bands. Its afterglow displays an unusually long-duration plateau followed by an achromatic break and a steep decline, deviating from canonical GRB afterglows. While long plateaus are often explained by central engine activity, we find that for GRB 250704B, an energy injection model requires unreasonable parameters. The afterglow is better explained by an off-axis power-law structured jet with a narrow core ($\\theta_c \\approx 0.7^{\\circ}$) viewed at a modest angle ($\\theta_v \\approx 1.9^{\\circ}$). A comparison with GRB 170817A shows that both events are consistent with the off-axis structured jet scenario, where the shape of the light curve is governed primarily by the geometry of the jet and the viewing angle rather than the energetics, microphysical parameters, or external density. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating the jet structure in GRB modeling.",

Since becoming operational in January 2024, MAG has continuously recorded local magnetic field data and has captured several solar transient events over the past one year. During these events, the IMF, typically around 5 nT, exhibited significant enhancements in magnitude. This study focuses on three such solar events observed in March, May, and October 2024. Analysis of the magnetic field power spectra during these events reveals fluctuations consistent with Kolmogorov type turbulence, characterized by a spectral slope close to -5/3. To emphasize changes in spectral behavior, the event-day spectra are compared with those from a day when the quiet solar wind conditions prevail. A marked contrast is observed: while the quiet periods exhibit anisotropic turbulence, the extreme events display quasi-isotropic behavior, with spectral slopes closely following the Kolmogorov spectrum across all three IMF components. The results, including detailed variations in spectral slope and turbulence characteristics, are presented and discussed in this paper.",

Galactic cosmic rays are charged particles with energies exceeding 10 MeV/nucl., originating from far beyond the boundaries of our Solar System. As they penetrate through the heliosphere - the region of space filled by the solar wind - they interact strongly with the interplanetary magnetic field. In this paper, we present numerical approaches to solving the so-called Parker transport equation for the isotropic velocity distribution function of GCRs. This equation includes a convective term, anisotropic diffusion, adiabatic cooling, and drifts. Additionally, the diffusion coefficient is spatially and energy-dependent, varying by several orders of magnitude. Our numerical approaches are based on the finite-difference method (Crank-Nicolson scheme) and the stochastic differential equations (SDE) method. The numerical methods were validated against a known analytical solution under simplified conditions. For the general problem formulation, which involves anisotropic diffusion and the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field configuration, we used the most efficient and flexible SDE method and compared the numerical results with the data from the works of Kota & Jokipii (1983) and Burger (2012). Special attention was devoted to incorporating drift along the heliospheric current sheet in the model.",

One of HAWC's primary challenges is characterizing air showers and estimate their physical parameters, a highly complex task due to the nature of the data and the processes involved. Currently, HAWC employs two energy estimators for gamma rays: the ground parameter method and a neural network-based approach. However, for cosmic rays, only the likelihood-based estimator is available. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to achieve more accurate estimation of the physical parameters of cosmic rays. These techniques are explored as an alternative for reconstructing the physical properties of extensive air showers using simulated data aligned with the observatory's configuration. Various models were trained and evaluated through an optimized pipeline and the most effective one was selected as the final implementation after a comprehensive comparison. This approach improves the accuracy of physical parameter estimation, contributing significantly to the detailed characterization of cosmic ray events.",

        "title": "On the synergetic use of Ariel and JWST for exoplanet atmospheric science",
        "abstract": "This white paper explores the potential for strategic synergies between the JWST and the Ariel telescopes, two flagship observatories poised to revolutionise the study of exoplanet atmospheres. Both telescopes have the potential to address common fundamental questions about exoplanets-especially concerning their nature and origins-and serve a growing scientific community. With their operations now anticipated to overlap, starting from 2030, there is a unique opportunity to enhance the scientific outputs of both observatories through coordinated efforts.   In this report, authored by the Ariel-JWST Synergy Working Group, part of the Ariel Consortium Science Team, we summarise the capabilities of JWST and Ariel; we highlight their key differences, similarities, synergies, and distinctive strengths. Ariel is designed to conduct a broad survey of exoplanet atmospheres but remains highly flexible, allowing the mission to integrate insights from JWST's discoveries. Findings from JWST, including data from initiatives shaped by NASA's decadal survey priorities and community-driven research themes, will inform the development of Ariel's core survey strategy. Conversely, Ariel's ability to perform broad-wavelength coverage observations for bright targets provides complementary avenues for exoplanet researchers, particularly those interested in time-domain observations and large-scale atmospheric studies.   This paper identifies key pathways for fostering JWST-Ariel synergies, many of which can be initiated even before Ariel's launch. Leveraging their complementary designs and scopes, JWST and Ariel can jointly address fundamental questions about the nature, formation, and evolution of exoplanets. Such strategic collaboration has the potential to maximise the scientific returns of both observatories and lay the foundation for future facilities in the roadmap to exoplanet exploration.",

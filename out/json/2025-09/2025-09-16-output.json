        "abstract": "It is commonly supposed that quenched field dwarfs near the edge of the Local Group (LG) are backsplash galaxies, having previously orbited within the Milky Way (MW) or M31's virial radius, whereas galaxies on first infall should still have gas and star formation. We measured proper motions (PMs) for six dwarf galaxies located 400-1000 kpc from the MW using the Hubble Space Telescope. For four galaxies (Aquarius, Cetus, Pisces, Tucana), we report the first PMs. For the remaining two (Leo T and Pegasus), we measure PMs with order-of-magnitude improvement. We compute orbital histories to assess whether any of the six are backsplash galaxies. While some have non-zero likelihoods of past interaction with the MW or M31, these are weak and typically occur at large distances (e.g., $>$ 2Rvir). The properties of Aquarius, Leo T, Pisces, and Pegasus are consistent with first passage through a massive halo. Cetus, which shows a low probability (~4-6%) of interacting with the MW or M31 in the last 6 Gyr, is more likely a backsplash galaxy resulting from an interaction with M31 over 6 Gyr ago, in the same regime where rigid orbital models become less reliable. Tucana has been thought to be a backsplash galaxy, but our orbits indicate it cannot have interacted with a massive LG host. Our results highlight the diversity of evolutionary pathways for isolated, intermediate-mass dwarfs ($M_* \\approx 10^5-10^7 M_{\\odot}$) and the need to reassess quenching mechanisms beyond environmental interactions with massive hosts.",

        "abstract": "It is thought that the Universe went through an early period known as the Dark Ages, during which primeval density fluctuations grew to form the first luminous objects, marking the beginning of Cosmic Dawn around 100 million years after the Big Bang. The 21-cm line of hydrogen atoms is the most promising probe of these epochs, with extensive observational efforts underway. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to precisely calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the global (sky-averaged) 21-cm radio intensity. We show that it presents a potential opportunity to probe the properties of dark matter in a new regime, corresponding to a length-scale of only 150,000 light years and a mass-scale of 20 million Solar masses. This effect can in principle be detected unambiguously during the Dark Ages, where the weak signal requires an array of global signal antennae. During Cosmic Dawn, when stellar radiation boosts the signal, a single global antenna suffices, but the clumping effect must then be separated from the effect of the stars. Our findings open new avenues for testing the nature of dark matter as well as non-standard cosmological models.",

Particles are considered bound if their energy does not exceed the escape energy of a potential well -- given by the closest saddle-point that connects to a deeper potential minimum. This approach has core benefits over previous approaches, since it does not require any ad-hoc thresholds (such as over-density criteria), it includes the gravitational effect of all particles in the binding criterion (improving over widely used self-potential binding checks) and it only operates with instantaneous information (making it simpler than approaches based on dynamical histories). We show that particles typically become bound between their first peri- and apo-centeric passage and that bound and unbound populations show very distinct characteristics through their distribution in phase space, their density profiles, their virial ratios, and their redshift evolution. Our findings suggest that it is possible to understand haloes as two-component systems, with one component being bound, virialized, of finite extent and evolving slowly in quasi-equilibrium and the other component being unbound, unvirialized and evolving rapidly.",

        "abstract": "The 21-cm line of hydrogen is the most promising probe of the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum, focusing on redshifts $z=20-40$. As the clumping effect arises from small-scale density fluctuations, it offers a unique opportunity to probe the standard cold dark matter model in a new regime and thus potentially investigate the properties of dark matter. To this end, we also study a warm dark matter $-$ like model with a Gaussian cutoff on a scale of 50 kpc. We find that clumping has a significant impact on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum. For example, for the Dark Ages case at $z=30$ and wavenumber $k=0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$, small-scale clustering enhances the 21-cm power spectrum by $13\\%$. Once Lyman-$\\alpha$ coupling kicks in due to the first stars, the 21-cm signal strengthens, and the effect of clumping grows; it suppresses the observable power spectrum at $z=20$ by a factor of two, while the cutoff model has less than half the clumping impact. The clumping effect is significantly higher than the sensitivity of the planned Square Kilometre Array (SKA) AA$^\\star$ configuration, by up to a factor of 20 for standard cold dark matter, though detection will require separation from foregrounds and from astrophysical contributions to the 21-cm power spectrum.",

Previous analyses of observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) carbon monoxide (CO) line emission maps did not classify these sources as cool outflow hosts. Using new high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, JWST mid-infrared photometry in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-tracing F770W band, we identify extended structures present off of the stellar disk. The identified structures are bright in the MIRI F770W and F2100W bands, suggesting they include PAHs as well as other dust grains. As PAHs have been shown to be destroyed in hot, ionized gas, these structures are likely to be outflows of cool (T$\\leq 10^4$K) gas. This work represents an exciting possibility for using mid infrared observations to identify and measure outflows in lower mass, lower star formation galaxies.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to explore whether astrophysical observations, primarily galaxy rotation curves, result from covarying coupling constants (CCC) rather than from dark matter. We have shown in earlier papers that cosmological observations, such as supernovae type 1a (Pantheon+), the small size of galaxies at cosmic dawn, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the sound horizon in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and time dilation effect, can be easily accounted for without requiring dark energy and dark matter when coupling constants are permitted to evolve in an expanding Universe, as predicted by Dirac, and the redshift is considered jointly due to the Universe's expansion and Zwicky's tired light (TL) effect. Here, we show that the CCC parameter {\\alpha} is responsible for generating the illusion of dark matter and dark energy, which we call {\\alpha}-matter and {\\alpha}-energy, and is influenced by the baryonic matter density distribution. While cosmologically {\\alpha} is a constant determined for the homogenous and isotropic Universe, e.g., by fitting Pantheon+ data, it can vary locally due to the extreme anisotropy of the matter distribution. Thus, in high baryonic density regions, one expects {\\alpha}-matter and {\\alpha}-energy densities to be relatively low and vice versa. We present its application to a few galaxy rotation curves from the SPARC database and find the results promising.",

We calculate the thermal and non-thermal contributions to the $b$ values. Both $b$ and the thermal contribution to $b$ can be substantially less than the CIE value. These narrow line widths are due to the time delay in recombination from O VI to O V in mixing regions, which results in substantial amounts of O VI at temperatures below the 2.9 $\\times$ 10$^{5}$ K CIE temperature.

Our sample includes nine objects found in three JWST wide survey fields, which have z=3.624 to 5.378 and M_B ~ -18.3 to -21.4 mag. Their light distributions follow gaussian profiles, with the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) values only 3.7%--34.6% larger than those of the point spread functions. Their sharpest FWHM sizes correspond to only 0.49 to 0.96 kpc. They have very strong [O III] and Halpha lines (median rest-frame equivalent widths of 1610.6 and 1374.0 A, respectively), and the line widths of the latter are only 150--360 km/s. Due to the limitation of the current data, the exact nature of this new population is still uncertain. The emission line diagnostics shows that at least one object is consistent with being AGN. On the other hand, the spectral energy distributions of most of the nine objects can be fitted reasonably by normal galaxy templates, which suggest that they could also be very young (median age of 120 Myrs), star-forming (median star formation rate of 1.8 Msun/yr) galaxies in the early formation stage (having acquired a median stellar mass of only 10^{8.4} Msun). If they are indeed star-forming galaxies, their gas-phase metallicities range from 12+log(O/H) = 7.8 to 8.3. It will be critical to understand this population by deeper medium-resolution spectroscopy in the future. If they are AGNs, they constitute a new kind of type 2 AGNs that are low-luminosity and almost \"hostless\". If they are star-forming galaxies, they also constitute a new kind whose early formation is likely a secular process starting from a very compact core, which is in line with the picture of a monolithic collapse.",

With at least one black hole (BH) in the upper-mass gap and both BHs exhibiting high spins ($\\chi_{1,2} \\gtrsim 0.8$), this event challenges standard isolated binary evolution models. A compelling alternative is a dynamical origin in star clusters, where stellar binaries and hierarchical mergers may both contribute to the formation of similar BBHs. In this work, we investigate the formation of GW231123-like events in different cluster environments using the B-POP semi-analytic population synthesis code. We find that low-metallicity environments ($Z \\lesssim 0.002$) are ideal for producing BBH mergers similar to GW231123. In young and globular clusters, these BBHs have components formed in stellar binaries, whilst in nuclear clusters there is also a significant contribution from BHs built-up via hierarchical mergers. Natal spins of BHs formed in stellar binaries are crucial to find GW231123 analogs. In particular, our models suggest that BHs from stellar binaries are likely characterized by high-spins. Simulated GW231123-like systems exhibit short delay times, $t_\\mathrm{del} \\sim 0.1 - 1$ Gyr, which suggests their progenitors formed close to the inferred merger redshift ($z = 0.39^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$).

Both star-forming (SF) and quiescent (QS) misaligned galaxies exhibit narrower HI linewidths compared to their gas-star aligned controls. The HI profiles of SF misaligned galaxies tend to be single-peaked, displaying a slightly higher fraction of single-peaked shape compared to their aligned controls. The QS misaligned galaxies exhibit prominently single-peaked HI profiles, while their aligned controls show distinct double-horned profiles. The shape of HI profiles is expected to change with the HI surface density radial gradients through external gas accretion -- the interaction between the accreted gas and the pre-existing gas leads to the re-distribution of angular momentum and induces gas inflow. It suggests that the progenitors of SF misaligned galaxies are central HI-enriched, in this case, the shape of HI profiles is insensitive to the further increase of central HI surface density. The progenitors of QS misaligned galaxies are central HI-deficient, hence the transition from central HI-deficient to HI-enriched surface density leads to significantly more single-peaked HI profiles.",

Using multi-object spectroscopy from the GLACE survey, we extracted fluxes and redshifts of [O II]$\\lambda\\lambda3727,3729$, $\\mathrm{H\\beta}$, and [O III]$\\lambda5007$ emission lines to derive star formation rates (SFRs) for 173 ELGs. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to obtain key evolutionary parameters such as stellar masses ($M_\\star$) and the 4000 \\r{A} break ($D4000$) index. We derived the $M_\\star-\\mathrm{SFR}$ relation for 98 star-forming galaxies (SFGs), finding 34.7% exhibit suppressed SFRs in the cluster, compared to 11.0% in the field. While the SFRs show no significant variation with local density, the fraction of SFGs is 1.55 times higher in the cluster outskirts than in intermediate-density regions. The specific SFR decreases strongly with $D4000$ for active SFGs but remains constant for suppressed galaxies. The fraction of suppressed galaxies in the infall region is 2.6 times higher than in the core, especially in the infalling structure B of the cluster. The cluster's total mass does not appear to be a key factor in SFG quenching. Star formation in Cl0024 galaxies is suppressed by the dense cluster environment. This suppression is evident in SFG fractions and parameters tracing long-term evolution, indicating prolonged quenching. The SFGs preferentially reside in low-density regions, while suppressed galaxies dominate the infall region, supporting a 'delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario.",

Here, we report a remarkable discovery of such a phenomenon that happened just 2.2 billion years after the Big Bang, during the Cosmic Noon era. Quasar SDSSJ141924.44+532315.5, powered by a one-billion-solar-mass black hole, is seen blasting a powerful jet that interacts with a hypermassive gas reservoir, creating a fascinating, clumpy, arc-like structure spanning over 250 kiloparsecs in projected length, consisting of at least eight clumps. Each clump contains billions of stars, is as massive as the Milky Way, and exhibits extreme levels of star formation. We interpret these findings as fragmentation of a cosmic filament triggered by a jet overpressurized expanding cocoon, which leads to the birth of protogalaxies, a process observed at scales never seen before. We find that the physical conditions within the filament are favorable for a fragmentation scenario to occur. We also discuss the survivability and evolution of individual clumps in the context of unsolved galaxy formation theory problems.",

        "abstract": "Recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope show that nearby spiral galaxies are dominated by the presence of H I and H II bubbles that strongly shape their surrounding medium. These bubbles result from the feedback of high-mass stars at different stages of their life cycle. However, early (pre-supernova) feedback from high-mass stars is still poorly quantified. Recent results from numerical simulations suggest that the impact of high-mass star early feedback (photoionization, wind) on star formation properties is complex, time-dependent, and strongly depends on physical conditions, including the magnetic field properties. In our Galaxy, ionized (H II) regions observed in different evolution stages show a high diversity of star formation in their associated photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). However, the way in which the low- to high-density interstellar medium evolves to this situation remains elusive. Quantifying the impact of early feedback from high-mass stars on star formation properties and star formation laws (star formation rate, star formation efficiency versus gas surface density, {\\Sigma}gas) will allow for a better understanding of the evolution of star formation laws in external galaxies, the laws that are key ingredients of galaxy evolution models. PRIMA, with its high sensitivity, large mapping efficiency, and polarimetric capabilities, offers a unique opportunity to address the way radiative feedback and magnetic field control star formation in the Milky Way.",

        "abstract": "Ly$\\alpha$ intensity mapping is emerging as a new probe of faint galaxies consisting the cosmic web that elude traditional surveys. However, the resonant nature of Ly$\\alpha$ radiative transfer complicates the interpretation of observed data. In this study, we develop a fast and accurate analytic prescription for computing the Ly$\\alpha$ intensity field on Mpc scales in the post-reionization Universe. Motivated by insights from Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) experiments, we exploit the fact that in a highly ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) with negligible damping-wing opacity, cosmological redshifting quickly drives Ly$\\alpha$ photons out of resonance, terminating the scattering process and simplifying their large-scale behavior. Photons emitted blueward of the Ly$\\alpha$ line center tend to scatter on a thin, nearly spherical surface of last scattering, with a radius determined by the redshifting distance to resonance. Based on this behavior, we derive closed-form expressions for the scattered emissivity and projected surface brightness that depend only on the source spectrum, the HI density, and the peculiar velocity field. When applied to a source in a realistically simulated IGM at $z = 3$, our model shows mild discrepancies with MCRT results within a physical Mpc of the host halo, where strong gravitational infall redistributes the scattered photons, but achieves better than 5% accuracy beyond that distance in both raw and cumulative surface brightness. Our prescription offers a computationally efficient alternative to MCRT for forward-modeling Ly$\\alpha$ intensity maps from cosmological simulations, enabling the inference of underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters from future observations.",

In this study, we aim to generalize the YOLO-CIANNA deep learning source detection and characterization method for 3D hyperspectral HI emission cubes. We present the adaptations we made to the regression-based detection formalism and the construction of an end-to-end 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone. We then describe a processing pipeline for applying the method to simulated 3D HI cubes from the SKA Observatory Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset. The YOLO-CIANNA method was originally developed and used by the MINERVA team that won the official SDC2 competition. Despite the public release of the full SDC2 dataset, no published result has yet surpassed MINERVA's top score. In this paper, we present an updated version of our method that improves our challenge score by 9.5%. The resulting catalog exhibits a high detection purity of 92.3%, best-in-class characterization accuracy, and contains 45% more confirmed sources than concurrent classical detection tools. The method is also computationally efficient, processing the full ~1TB SDC2 data cube in 30 min on a single GPU. These state-of-the-art results highlight the effectiveness of 3D CNN-based detectors for processing large hyperspectral data cubes and represent a promising step toward applying YOLO-CIANNA to observational data from SKA and its precursors.",

However, traditional tracers of dense gas, such as the low-$J$ transitions of HCN and HCO$^+$, are predominantly optically thick. This characteristic presents a significant challenge in accurately estimating the column density of dense gas and mapping its spatial distribution. Optically-thin tracers, including HC$_3$N (10-9) and isotopologues of HCN, HCO$^+$, HNC (1-0), among others, emerge as better tracers, by enabling more precise measurements and analyses of the dense gas in galaxies. Here, we present the first high-resolution ($\\sim$3.8$''$, corresponding to $\\sim$65 pc) molecular line observations of the nearby starburst galaxy M~82 with IRAM Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). Notably, HC$_3$N (10-9) and H$^{13}$CN (1-0) emission lines are brighter at the northeast part (NE lobe) than those at the southwest part (SW lobe) of M~82, suggesting a higher accumulation of dense gas at the NE lobe. The spatial distributions of H41$\\alpha$ and 3-mm continuum emission indicate that starburst activity varies across the central starburst disk, with more intense star formation occurring at the SW lobe compared to the NE lobe. The average optical depths of HCN and HCO$^+$ (1-0) across the triple-peaked regions exhibit significant variation, with the highest values observed at the NE lobe. Our results suggest a potential evolutionary sequence in M~82, where the distributions of star formation and dense gas appear to be partially decoupled -- a phenomenon that classical dense gas tracers cannot adequately probe.",

The IGMF is expected to be generated either via processes mainly connected to astrophysical processes or it could be a relic of phase transitions in the early universe. Upper bounds to the average field present are set via observations of Faraday rotation measure. Lower bounds have been derived from the non-detection of secondary gamma-rays possibly produced in electromagnetic cascades. We investigate the presence of IGMFs by studying the GeV gamma-ray emission from the nearby blazar Mkn~501 ($z=0.034$), searching for evidence of the extended halo expected to be observed around the point source. We analyse 14 years of data from Fermi-LAT and Swift-XRT/BAT to construct a time-average synchrotron-self Compton model for the TeV spectrum of Mkn~501. This injection spectrum is used to simulate the resulting cascade emission with the ELMAG code for different magnetic field and coherence length configurations. These templates are fit to the Fermi-LAT data to find a best-fitting model for the cascade emission. We find significant ($\\ge 5 \\sigma$ trial-corrected) evidence for extended secondary emission around Mkn~501, which is consistent with an IGMF with $B_\\mathrm{rms}=1.5_{-0.6}^{+1.6}\\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{G}$ and a coherence length of $\\ell_C=(10\\pm 3)~\\mathrm{kpc}$. The source needs to actively inject TeV gamma-rays for at least 45000 years to match the level of secondary emission. Our results indicate that the secondary gamma-rays are significantly present in the $\\it{Fermi}$-LAT data. The effect of plasma-heating by pairs in the cascade appears to be negligible for Mkn 501.

As our nearest massive galaxy, M31 provides a rich source population with many potential lenses in its halo crossing our field of view at any one time. In this paper we explore the probability that X-ray sources in M31 will be lensed by white dwarfs in M31's halo. We find an expected lensing rate of 2.6/year within the mean archival Swift XRT field-of-view, and 6.3/year for the whole galaxy. For X-ray emitting sources harboring accreting neutron stars and black holes, we find that microlensing offers a unique opportunity to constrain the properties of the inner accretion flow. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to recover both the spin of the black hole and the temperature profile of the accretion disk by discerning their effects upon the profile of the microlensing magnification. We show that these parameters have a significant effect on the shape of the light curve, with the effect of spin being more pronounced at smaller impact parameters and higher energies, while the effect of the temperature profile is larger at lower energies and larger impact parameters. This suggests that multi-band observations of a single lensing event could be used to robustly constrain both parameters.",

In this work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass $\\sum m_{\\nu}$. We consider three dark energy models ($\\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of $\\sum m_{\\nu}$ by about $5.8\\%-10.2\\%$, and we obtain $\\sum m_{\\nu} < 0.167~\\mathrm{eV}$ ($2\\sigma$) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of $f_{*,10} \\gtrsim 0.146-0.161$.

The emission-measure-weighted average temperature inferred from X-ray spectral fits to regions in the southern rim is $0.95\\pm0.17$ keV, consistent with the electron temperature implied by the shock velocity after accounting for Coulomb equilibration and adiabatic expansion. In contrast, the emission-measure-weighted average temperature for the northeast region is $0.77\\pm0.04$ keV, which is significantly lower than the value inferred from the shock velocity. We fit 1-D evolutionary models for the shock in the southern rim and northeast region, using the measured radius and propagation velocity into a constant density and power-law profile circumstellar medium.

Located within the remnant of a giant molecular cloud, it exhibits a complex structure of ionized gas, molecular material, dust, and embedded clusters. In October 2023, the region was observed as part of the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM) integral field spectroscopy survey. Covering a radius of approximately 1 degree, the dataset comprises 33,326 spectra with spatially resolved information spanning 390 - 980 nm. We present a structural analysis of the ionized, molecular, and dusty components using multi-wavelength observations: optical spectroscopy from SDSS-V LVM, 12CO emission from PMO/MWISP (sub-millimeter), and dust emission from WISE (12 micron) and Herschel (far-infrared). These datasets were complemented with the positions of ionizing stars to study emission structures traced by H alpha, H beta, [O III], [N II], and [S II], as well as the spatial distribution of line ratios (H alpha/H beta, [O III]/H beta, [N II]/H alpha, and [S II]/H alpha) relative to the surrounding molecular cloud. Our analysis reveals interaction zones between ionized and neutral gas, including filaments, globules, and dense regions with or without ongoing star formation. Radial and quadrant-based flux profiles further highlight morphological and ionization variations, supporting the scenario in which the Rosette Nebula evolved from a non-homogeneous molecular cloud with a thin, sheet-like structure.",

We present a Bayesian framework for joint calibration and map-making using Gibbs sampling, which provides access to the full joint posterior of calibration and sky map parameters. Our data model incorporates instrumental noise based on the radiometer equation, capturing the coupling between noise level and system temperature without assuming a fixed noise amplitude. To enable unbiased and fast estimation of gain and system temperature, we develop an iterative generalised least squares (GLS) sampling method. Absolute flux calibration can be achieved either with external sources or internally using known signal injections, such as noise diodes. To handle stochastic gain variations, we introduce a $1/f$ noise model that avoids spurious periodic correlations in the time domain caused by the conventional assumption of diagonal DFT noise covariance. Furthermore, we implement this workflow in an efficient software package, using the Levinson algorithm and a polynomial emulator to reduce the computational complexity of noise parameter sampling, ensuring good scalability. Although demonstrated for auto-correlation measurements, the framework and techniques generalise to cross-correlation and interferometric data.",

The foreground radio brightness must also be accurately accounted for when measuring the cosmic background radiation and departures from its Planck spectrum that trace astrophysical processes in the early Universe, cosmic dark ages, cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. Here we report a new, precision measurement of the sky spectral brightness over radio frequencies from 60 MHz to 350 MHz. Our measurement motivates a significant correction to previous all-sky images made in this band and the Global Sky Model (GSM) that is constructed from these and other sky images made at radio wavelengths. We find that the GSM requires subtraction of an offset exceeding 100K below 100 MHz and scaling up by a factor of approximately 1.2 below 200 MHz rising to a factor of 1.5 at 350 MHz, thus significantly enhancing previous estimates of unaccounted excess in radio sky brightness. Our measurements were made with a new receiver architecture that dynamically self-calibrates for receiver noise and bandpass in situ, while connected to an antenna. We used a single, accurately modelled, wideband logperiodic antenna placed on a 40m diameter ground mesh. Our accurate measurement requires upward revision of sky brightness and motivates revisiting models for source populations and dark matter decay. Additionally, sky models scaled to our measurements serve as a stable reference in calibrating the absolute flux density scale for low-frequency radio telescopes. This will be important for calibration accuracy of the SKA-Low telescope, that will operate at the frequencies of our measurements.",

One of these processes is the acceleration of non-thermal ions, which will, eventually, reach relativistic speeds and become cosmic rays. This process is difficult to simulate in a computer model because it requires both macro-physics (the overall shape of the shock) and micro-physics (the interaction between individual particles and the magnetic field). The combined PIC-MHD method is one of several options to get around this problem. It is based on the assumption that a plasma can be described as a combination of a thermal gas, which can be accurately described as a fluid using grid-based magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and a small non-thermal component which has to be described as individual particles using particle-in-cell (PIC). By combining aspects of both methods, we reduce the computational costs while maintaining the ability to trace the acceleration of individual particles. We apply this method to a variety of astrophysical shock configurations to investigate if, and how, they can contribute to the cosmic ray spectrum.",

A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation.

Applying these models to static neutron stars via Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and to binary mergers via relativistic hydrodynamics, we find distinctive signatures: (i) twin star branches with 0.5-2.0 km radius differences at fixed mass, (ii) equation of state softening in coexistence regions reducing maximum masses by 0.2-0.4 solar masses, (iii) delayed post-merger gravitational-wave frequency shifts of 200-400 Hz, and (iv) enhanced neutrino emission during phase transitions. Confronted with multimessenger constraints from GW170817, NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, and perturbative QCD, our models suggest strong first-order transitions are marginally consistent with current data but produce signatures detectable by next-generation detectors. Neutron star core sound speeds satisfy c_s^2 < 0.5c^2, with transient conformal bound violations in 2-4 times saturation density. This framework yields quantitative predictions for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, establishing foundations for precision QCD matter tests and possible quark matter discovery.",

        "abstract": "Recent observations have revealed that dust is widespread and abundant in galaxies up to $z\\,{\\backsimeq}\\,8$, significantly influencing their appearance and spectral properties. In the early Universe, dust is thought to form primarily in supernova (SN) ejecta, but also undergoes destruction by the reverse shock. Studying dust in local supernova remnants (SNRs) of different sizes and ages thus provides key constraints on dust formation and evolution during cosmic dawn. Using the newly released 3D $R_{\\rm V}$ map, we derived local $R_{\\rm V} \\equiv A_{\\rm V}/E(B-V)$ values for dust in 14 Galactic SNRs in the early Sedov phase and their surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). For the first time, we detect a moderately strong positive correlation between the difference in SNR and ISM $R_{\\rm V}$ ($\\Delta R_{\\rm V}$) and SNR radius ($R_{\\rm SNR}$), with a Spearman coefficient of $r_{\\rm s}\\,{=}\\,0.62\\,{\\pm}\\,0.14$. This trend offers direct observational evidence for a redistribution of dust grain sizes toward larger grains during SN shock processing, consistent with theoretical models. Our findings provide essential observational constraints on dust size evolution in SNRs and important implications for understanding the rapid enrichment and survival of dust in the early Universe.",

The fitting is performed by Nelder-Mead $\\chi^2$ minimisation, with uncertainties evaluated through MCMC. The catalogue of stellar temperatures is updated for our sample for the calculation of luminosities. The extinctions agree well with interstellar extinction. We find evidence of circumnebular extinction for one PN, and evaluate its effect on the planetary nebulae luminosity function. Four new close binaries are identified from the spectral energy distributions. The binary fraction in the full sample is between 23% and 36%. We use our compiled data to evaluate the quality of the central star identifications in the literature.

Also, in a sample of bulge spheroid stars, some of them showed a moderate P-enhancement in the range +0.5 < [P/Fe] < +1.0. In this paper we derive the P abundance of moderately metal-poor ([Fe/H] ~-1) GC stars, aiming to check if the phenomenon could be related to the unusual multiple stellar populations found in most GCs. Here we present the detection of P-moderately enhanced stars among two out of seven bulge GCs (Tonantzintla 1, and NGC 6316_, with metallicities similar to those of the bulge field P-rich stars. Using H-band high-resolution (R~22,500) spectra from the APOGEE-2 survey, we present the first high-resolution abundance analysis of [P/Fe] from the PI 16482.932 A line in a sample of selected bulge GCs. We find that all P-rich stars tend to also be N-rich, that hints at the origin of P-rich stars as second-generation stars in GCs. However no other correlations of P and other elements are found, that are usually indicators of second-generation stars. Further studies with larger samples and comparisons with field stars will be needed before any firm conclusions are drawn.",

We categorise the SNe Ia into three distinct groups according to the distribution of their host galaxies on the star-formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass ($M_\\star$) plane. Each region comprises host galaxies at distinct stages in their evolutionary pathways: Region 1 - low-mass hosts; Region 2 - high-mass, star-forming hosts and Region 3 - high-mass, passive hosts. We find SNe Ia in host galaxies located in Region 1 have the steepest slope (quantified by $\\beta$) between their colours and luminosities, with $\\beta_{\\mathrm{R_1}} = 3.51 \\pm 0.16$. This differs at the ${\\sim}6\\sigma$ significance level to SNe Ia in Region 3, which have the shallowest colour-luminosity slope with $\\beta_{\\mathrm{R_3}} = 2.12 \\pm 0.16$. After correcting SNe Ia in each subsample by their respective $\\beta$, events in Region 3 (high-mass, passive hosts) are $0.07 - 0.12$ mag ($>3\\sigma$) brighter, post-standardisation. We conclude that future cosmological analyses should apply standardisation relations to SNe Ia based upon the region in which the SN host galaxy lies in the SFR-$M_\\star$ plane. Alternatively, cosmological analyses should restrict the SN Ia sample to events whose host galaxies occupy a single region of this plane.",

The ring-like structure is redshifted with respect to the clump, spanning from $V_{\\rm sys,lsr} + 0.9$ to $V_{\\rm sys,lsr} + 2.9$ km s$^{-1}$, with a total mass of 109 $M_{\\odot}$. It is spatially coincident with 1.3 mm and 3.0 mm dust continuum emission from cores, and several protostellar outflows. However, no free-free emission or H\\textsc{ii} region is detected in association with this structure. With a slow expansion speed indicated by the position-velocity diagram, this ring structure differs from rings previously identified in more evolved star-forming regions. Possible explanations for the ring-like structure include a relic wind-blown bubble produced by a deeply embedded young stellar object, a hollow cavity formed by cloud-cloud interactions, a gas ring resulting from a temperature gradient, or a line-of-sight superposition of multiple outflows or dense clouds. This discovery offers a rare observational glimpse into the earliest dynamical processes involved in massive star formation.",

Luminosity and redshift are found to be positively correlated with a power law form for both high- and low-frequency FRBs, showing an obvious evolution of luminosity with redshift. Furthermore, we compare the differential luminosity and local event rate distributions of high- and low-luminosity FRBs at different frequencies. It is found that the event rates of these sub-samples of repeating FRBs similarly exceed the star formation rate at lower redshift than 1.

Our analysis shows that flares are present in some observations, whereas they are absent in others. Flaring state exhibits two-component spectra at a lower average flux level, whereas the non-flaring state displays single-component spectra at a higher average flux level. The M74 X-1 spectra are best described by the combination of accretion disk and Comptonization components, a dual thermal disk blackbody model, and a modified multi-temperature disk blackbody model. Using the dual thermal disk blackbody model, we obtain cool and hot temperatures of $T_{in}$ (cool) = $0.38^{+0.08}_{-0.06}$ keV and $T_{in}$ (hot) = $1.67^{+0.18}_{-0.13}$ keV, respectively, suggesting two temperature emitting regions and indicating possible presence of outflowing wind along with the accretion disk. We found a Gaussian feature at $E_{line}$ = $0.96^{+0.05}_{-0.11}$ keV with $\\sigma$ = $0.11^{+0.13}_{-0.06}$ keV in the spectra of the flaring state which can be interpreted as the unresolved wind feature in the system when compared to similar feature seen in other ULXs. Plotting the hardness luminosity diagram, we get a trend of increasing hardness with luminosity, suggesting the presence of geometrical beaming in a low-inclination system. Additionally, using the hot disk blackbody component from the dual thermal disk blackbody model, we estimate the mass of the compact object to be M = $7.1^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$ M$_\\odot$, classifying it as a stellar-mass black hole and confirming super-Eddington accretion in the system.",

        "abstract": "The Period-Luminosity (PL) relation is usually derived using time-averaged magnitudes, which require multiple-epoch observations to determine periods and adequately sample the light curves. Although single-epoch observations are more practical and require significantly less observational effort, they inherently introduce greater photometric scatter, leading to an increased dispersion in the derived Period-Luminosity relations. In this paper, we explore, in detail, a method that transforms single random-phase data to their mean-light values, using information obtained in other bands for the same Cepheid. This approach enables the accurate re-construction of mean-light PL relations for wavelengths observed with space-based facilities, for instance, where the number of epochs per star makes simple averaging or template fitting less than optimal, with the latter requiring very high-precision periods for predictive phasing. While applying this technique across multiple bands, from optical to mid-IR, we focus particularly on widely separated bands covering the mid-IR to the optical. We showcase this method using the J band (as being observed by JWST) as the random-phase component. Our results show that this correction reduces the scatter of the PL relation in the J band by a factor of approximately $0.7\\times$, equivalent to increasing the number of random-phase observations by a factor of 10, needed to obtain the same increase in precision as delivered here.",

In this study, we analyse the emission and observational properties of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Hernquist dark matter (DM) halo by considering three simplified accretion models, which have not been previously explored in such detail. Based on our findings, direct emission contributes markedly to the whole observed intensity for a Schwarzschild-Hernquist black hole encircled by a geometrically thin accretion disk. The corresponding regions and measured intensities of the lensing ring, the photon ring, and direct emission are sensitive to the parameters of the Hernquist DM halo. Apart from disk accretion, we also study two spherical accretion models: static and infalling. With increasing Hernquist DM parameters, both models exhibit a significant decrease in the measured intensity, yet the photon spheres are enlarged by an increase of $\\sim2\\%$ to $\\sim30\\%$. Furthermore, Doppler de-boosting due to the infalling accretion results in darker shadow images compared to static cases. By precising visualisations of the shadows, our results suggest that the observational characteristics of black hole shadows can serve as a powerful probe for distinguishing between different DM distributions around supermassive black holes.",

The extinction-penetrating JWST/NIRCam Br$\\alpha$ and PAH and ALMA 3 mm continuum imaging exposes the complexity of the ionized inner nebula. JWST/NIRCam H$_2$ imaging traces the full, $\\sim$1.1 pc extent of the bubble-like lobes formed by fast ($\\sim$300-400 km s$^{-1}$) polar outflows, while ALMA $^{13}$CO(1-0) mapping reveals a point-symmetric, slowly ($\\sim$10 km s$^{-1}$) expanding equatorial torus of radius $\\sim$0.13 pc. In striking contrast, the [Fe II] image displays an extended S-shaped emission morphology that traces collisions between an active, collimated wind and slower-moving material along the lobe rims. No X-rays are detected from the nebula or its central star in deep Chandra/HRC-I imaging. However, the combined HST and JWST imaging reveals a near-IR excess at the central star indicative of emission from hot ($\\sim$1000 K) circumstellar dust. We propose that interactions between the nebular progenitor star and a close companion are responsible for the ejection of NGC 6537's molecular torus, the formation of a circumbinary dust disk, and the launching of fast, wandering, collimated outflows that have inflated the polar lobe bubbles traced by near-IR H$_2$ emission and are presently generating the [Fe II]-emitting shocks.",

        "abstract": "Precise determination of galaxy cluster masses is crucial for establishing reliable mass-observable scaling relations in cluster cosmology. We employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate galaxy cluster masses from radially sampled profiles of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) inferred from X-ray observations. GNNs naturally handle inputs of variable length and resolution by representing each ICM profile as a graph, enabling accurate and flexible modeling across diverse observational conditions. We trained and tested GNN model using state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred Project. The mass estimates using our method exhibit no systematic bias compared to the true cluster masses in the simulations. Additionally, we achieve a scatter in recovered mass versus true mass of about 6\\%, which is a factor of six smaller than obtained from a standard hydrostatic equilibrium approach. Our algorithm is robust to both data quality and cluster morphology and it is capable of incorporating model uncertainties alongside observational uncertainties. Finally, we apply our technique to XMM-Newton observed galaxy cluster samples and compare the GNN derived mass estimates with those obtained with $Y_{\\rm SZ}$-M$_{500}$ scaling relations. Our results provide strong evidence, at 5$\\sigma$ level, for a mass-dependent bias in SZ derived masses, with higher mass clusters exhibiting a greater degree of deviation. Furthermore, we find the median bias to be $(1-b)=0.85_{-14}^{+34}$, albeit with significant dispersion due to its mass dependence. This work takes a significant step towards establishing unbiased observable mass scaling relations by integrating X-ray, SZ and optical datasets using deep learning techniques, thereby enhancing the role of galaxy clusters in precision cosmology.",

        "abstract": "The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has identified several thousand planet candidates orbiting a wide variety of stars, and has provided an exciting opportunity for demographic studies. However, current TESS planet searches require significant manual inspection efforts to identify planets among the enormous number of detected transit-like signatures, which limits the scope of such searches. Demographic studies also require a detailed understanding of the relationship between observed and true exoplanet populations; a task for which current TESS planet catalogs are rendered unsuitable by the subjectivity of vetting by eye. We present LEO-Vetter, a publicly available and fully automated exoplanet vetting system designed after the Kepler Robovetter, which is capable of efficiently producing catalogs of promising planet candidates and making statistically robust TESS demographic studies possible. LEO-Vetter implements flux- and pixel-level tests against noise/systematic false positives and astrophysical false positives. The vetter achieves high completeness (91%) and high reliability against noise/systematic false alarms (97%) based on its performance on simulated data. We demonstrate the usefulness of the vetter by searching ~200,000 M dwarf light curves, and reducing ~20,000 transit-like detections down to 172 uniformly vetted planet candidates. LEO-Vetter facilitates analyses that would otherwise be impractical to perform on all possible signals due to time constraints or computational limitations. Users will be able to efficiently produce their own TESS planet catalog starting with transit-like detections, as well as have the framework needed to characterize their catalog's completeness and reliability for occurrence rates.",

        "abstract": "Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning approach combining Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection in synthetic data. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. The LSTM autoencoder learns compressed representations while maintaining sensitivity to subtle signal features distinguishing true astrophysical events from noise artifacts. We generate realistic synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses, embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics: 92.3 percent precision, 67.6 percent recall, and 80.6 percent AUC-ROC, with an average precision score of 0.780. These results exceed LIGO's stringent detection thresholds for confident gravitational wave identification. Compared to traditional approaches, the CWT-LSTM autoencoder shows superior ability to maintain low false alarm rates while preserving sensitivity to weak signals. The method's end-to-end learning eliminates hand-crafted features and template banks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust gravitational wave detection systems. The unsupervised nature enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies, providing complementary \"blind search\" capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.",

        "abstract": "Nearly 210 binary black hole (BBH) mergers have been observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network during its four observing runs. Generic BBHs are spinning, and their spins are misaligned with the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$. These misaligned spins cause $\\vec{L}$ to precess in a cone with dimensionless precession amplitude $\\tilde{\\theta}$ and frequency $\\tilde{\\Omega}$ about the nearly constant direction of the total angular momentum. This precession modulates the observed GWs. We propose a model of regularly precessing (RP) waveforms that incorporates $\\tilde{\\theta}$ and $\\tilde{\\Omega}$ directly as parameters. We investigate how these waveforms vary as functions of these precessional parameters, as well as binary orientation and sky location. We use the Lindblom criterion to estimate that precession can be detected in a RP source with signal-to-noise ratio $\\rho$ when the mismatch $\\epsilon$ with a non-precessing (NP) source with otherwise identical parameters exceeds $1/2\\rho^2$. Precession is most detectable when $\\vec{L}$ precesses through configurations we call +~nulls during the inspiral. At +~nulls, a NP source only emits +-polarization to which the GW detector is insensitive. The large mismatch between a RP source and this vanishing NP signal enhances the detectability of precession. We also explore the detectability of precession as a function of redshift $z$ for different BBH populations. We find that for BBHs with isotropically oriented maximal spins, precession is detectable in a majority of systems out to $z \\approx 0.3$ for chirp masses $10 \\lesssim M_c/M_\\odot \\lesssim 40$ and mass ratios $q \\gtrsim 0.5$.

We demonstrate that deriving power spectrum estimators directly by linearly combining auto- and cross-spectra instead of maps allows us to obtain a different constrained-optimization problem that allows fewer (deprojection) constraint equations than combining at map level using the constrained ILC method. Through simulations, we show that our Spectral internal linear combination (SpILC) produces CMB power spectrum estimators with more than 7 times smaller errorbars than constrained ILC (with thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and cosmic infrared background deprojections) at $\\ell\\gtrsim 4000$ for Simons Observatory-like observations. Spectral ILC outperforms constrained ILC methods when some modeled components are spatially uncorrelated, e.g. the primary CMB is uncorrelated with foregrounds, and the difference in performance is most significant at noise-dominated scales. More generally, our work shows that component-separated maps with foreground deprojections do not necessarily produce minimum-variance two-or-higher-point estimators.",

We consider a minimal model in which DR is described as an effectively massless axion-like particle with quartic self-interactions. These interactions are incorporated into the Einstein-Boltzmann equations using the relaxation time approximation and implemented in the $\\texttt{CLASS}$ code. We show that increasing the strength of DR self-interactions suppresses anisotropic stress, thereby reducing the damping of gravitational waves and leading to an enhancement of the primordial $B$-mode signal relative to the free-streaming case. Using mock CMB data and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, we show that neglecting DR self-interactions may bias the inferred value of $r$ by an amount comparable to the uncertainty expected in forthcoming CMB polarization experiments, such as the ground-based $\\textit{Simons Observatory}$ and the satellite missions $\\textit{LiteBIRD}$ and PICO. Our results emphasize the importance of properly modeling DR interactions in future precision searches for primordial $B$-modes in order to obtain unbiased constraints on inflationary gravitational waves.",

However, this view is being completely altered by the early dark energy (EDE) resolutions of the Hubble tension, known as the most prominent tension the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model is suffering from. In corresponding models with pre-recombination EDE, resolving the Hubble tension (i.e., achieving $H_0\\sim 73$km/s/Mpc) must be accompanied by a shift of $n_s$ towards unity to maintain consistency with the cosmological data, which thus implies a scale invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum with $n_s=1$ $(|n_s-1|\\simeq {\\cal O}(0.001))$. In this work, we strengthen and reconfirm this result with the latest ground-based CMB data from ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1, the precise measurements at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity.

JWST has detected new candidate HII regions around massive stars previously missed by radio telescopes. MIRI has detected radiation escaping from the forming massive cluster Sgr B2 N along its outflow cavities, demonstrating that infrared radiation finds geometric escape routes even in the densest, most heavily embedded regions in the universe. JWST further highlights the gas asymmetry in the cloud, showing a sharp, straight cutoff along the eastern cloud edge.   Despite the great sensitivity of these observations, no extended population of YSOs has been detected, placing a limit on their minimum extinction; this result hints that star formation has only just begun in the cloud. Together, these results suggest that, despite already holding the crown for most actively star-forming cloud, we have underestimated the total star formation in Sgr B2.

The simulations span a range of accretion rates, two black hole spins, and two magnetic field topologies, and include resolution studies as well as comparisons with non-radiative models. Super-Eddington accretion flows consistently develop geometrically thick disks supported by radiation pressure, regardless of magnetic field configuration. Radiation generated in the inner disk drives substantial outflows, forming conical funnel regions that limit photon escape and result in very low radiation efficiency. The accretion flows are highly turbulent with thermal energy transport dominated by radiation advection rather than diffusion. Angular momentum is primarily carried outward by Maxwell stress, with turbulent Reynolds stress playing a subdominant role. Both strong and weak jets are produced. Strong jets arise from sufficient net vertical magnetic flux and rapid black hole spin and can effectively evacuate the funnel, enabling radiation to escape through strong geometric beaming. In contrast, weak jets fail to clear the funnel, which becomes obscured by radiation-driven outflows and leads to distinct observational signatures. Spiral structures are observed in the plunging region, behaving like density waves. These super-Eddington models are applicable to a variety of astronomical systems, including ultraluminous X-ray sources, little red dots, and black hole transients.",

        "abstract": "Isomerism in complex organic molecules provides key insights into the formation mechanisms and physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM). Among the C$_2$H$_5$NO isomers, only acetamide and trans-N-methylformamide (trans-NMF) have been detected in space. The recent detection of higher-energy isomers in other chemical families raises questions about the formation and abundance of less stable isomers. We used ultra-sensitive wide-band spectral surveys obtained with the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes to search for cis-NMF towards the Galactic Centre molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. We present the first detection of cis-NMF in the ISM, with 55 unblended or slightly blended transitions, 44 of which were new transitions identified based on extrapolated spectroscopic data. Due to the lack of collisional rate coefficients, a quasi-non-LTE analysis, which separated the transitions into different K$_a$ ladders, was used to determine the excitation conditions. The resulting trans/cis-NMF isomeric ratio of 2.9$\\pm$0.6 deviates significantly from thermodynamic expectations, suggesting that kinetic non-equilibrium processes and stereospecific chemical pathways are responsible for the formation of cis-NMF in this environment. The detection of cis-NMF expands the known inventory of interstellar C$_2$H$_5$NO isomers and challenges the assumption that isomer abundances strictly correlate with thermodynamic stability. Laboratory and theoretical studies propose formation via CH$_3$NCO hydrogenation or spin-forbidden reactions involving CH$_2$ and NH$_2$CHO, though these may not reflect typical ISM conditions. This finding highlights the need for further investigation into isomerisation mechanisms and constrains astrochemical models of complex organic molecules.",

We used the Balmer line profiles to compare with current atmospheric models to determine the photospheric parameters of the white dwarfs, minimizing contamination introduced by the infrared source. We used photometric data from the SDSS and the \\textit{Gaia} mission to resolve the degeneracies between hot and cold solutions from spectroscopy, constraining the photospheric parameters. These results help refine our understanding of white dwarf evolution in binary systems, focusing on stellar companions that cause the infrared excess.

        "abstract": "Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed massive, evolved galaxies only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, challenging standard cosmological models. To test the hypothesis that the Galactic nucleus may act as a source of matter and energy capable of accelerating galaxy formation, we examined whether the Milky Way itself shows signs of central activity. Expansion of the Galactic center would imply such activity in its nuclear region. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed stellar motions along the south north axis of the Galaxy using Gaia DR3 data. Average Galactocentric radial velocities were computed in 50 control points, spaced by 0.1 kpc with a sampling radius of 0.05 kpc, up to 5 kpc from the Galactic center. The results show a strong symmetry: in the northern region, 36 of 50 points have positive velocities, with an average of 19.15 +/- 10.80 km/s (N = 50), while in the southern region, 37 of 50 points have negative velocities, with an average of - 19.24 +/- 8.22 km/s (N = 50). A Students t test confirms that the two distributions differ significantly (0.003).   The combination of positive average velocities in the north and negative average velocities in the south indicates a symmetric outflow of stars away from the Galactic center, consistent with expansion in its central region.   These Galactocentric radial velocities are consistent with the formation of massive, evolved galaxies within 300 My, as observed by JWST. If extended to other galaxies, the results (together with earlier findings on globular cluster motions) suggest that aspects of standard galaxy formation models may require refinement. This interpretation, however, remains preliminary and requires further study.",

Forming ~10^9 Msun SMBHs by z ~ 6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model (Sassano et al. 2021) by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli et al. 2007; Lousto et al. 2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Pop III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by ~20-30% by z = 6 and creates a population of off-nuclear (\"wandering\") BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets ~0.1 arcsec and line-of-sight velocity shifts ~10^2-10^3 km/s in a few percent of high-z quasars.

One theory proposed to explain this behaviour is the existence of a bow shock driven by a spherically symmetric time-varying dusty wind from the star, which is assumed to vary due to radial pulsations. To test this hypothesis, this study uses a new framework developed in \\textsc{ZEUS3D}, a multiphysics magnetohydrodynamics code. The results of this work show that when a time-varying stellar wind is at its maximum brightness, the polarization signal is at a minimum due to the wind structure and a dense, symmetric shell that forms around the star. Conversely, when the brightness is at a minimum, the symmetric shell around the star is much less dense, and the polarization is instead dominated by the asymmetric bow shock structure, causing the polarization signal to attain a maximum value. Numerically reproducing the observed inverse relationship between the polarization and light curve provides a strong theoretical argument that a variable stellar wind bow shock is the solution to the curious case of V CVn.",

We modified the analytical Shakura-Sunyaev models for a general opacity prescription, and derived radial profiles of various quantities.These profiles were computed for the fixed accretion rate, $\\dot M = 2\\times 10^{-5}\\,M_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$, inferred from the observed rate of change of the binary period. More general models were computed numerically, using 1-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics, accounting for viscous, radiative as well as irradiation terms. The initial conditions were taken from the analytical models.   To achieve the accretion rate, the surface density~$\\Sigma$ must be much higher (of the order of $10^4\\,{\\rm kg}\\,{\\rm m}^{-2}$ for the viscosity parameter $\\alpha = 0.1$) than in the kinematic model. Viscous dissipation and radiative cooling in the optically thick regime lead to a high midplane temperature~$T$ (up to $10^5\\,{\\rm K}$). The accretion disc is still gas pressure dominated with the opacity close to Kramers one.} To reconcile temperature profiles with observations, we had to distinguish three different temperatures: midplane, atmospheric and irradiation. The latter two are comparable to observations (30000 to 12000\\,K). We demonstrate that the aspect ratio~$H$ of 0.08 can be achieved in a hydrostatic equilibrium, as opposed to previous works considering the disc to be vertically unstable.",

        "abstract": "The global 21 cm signal from the hyperfine transition of cosmic atomic hydrogen is theorised to track the state of the early Universe via the analysis of its absorption and emission with respect to the radio background. Detecting this signal has been a challenge for astronomers since it was first postulated due to the presence of strong galactic foregrounds obfuscating the transition. Forward modelling techniques that aim to simulate and then remove these foregrounds have been suggested as a workaround to this problem. This technique, however, requires a precise and accurate understanding of the foregrounds in question. As we move into the next major lunar standstill, the moon will be able to occult high power areas of the sky in ways that are unaccounted for by maps used to simulate these foregrounds, and thereby disrupt signal recovery. We show that in toy cases an occultation from the moon, or other proximate object, leading to a mismatch in our expected and actual foregrounds of 15 parts per million increases the error in signal recovery of up to 20\\%. We show that this level of disruption can happen when the moon is found towards the centre of the galaxy and is amplified when this alignment happens at high directivity regions of the antenna beam, causing a disruption of up to 180 parts per million, leading to a signal recovery error of 115\\%. This allows us to identify lunar alignment scenarios that should be actively avoided to preserve signal fidelity. We also demonstrate that a body with a smaller apparent size than the moon, such as Venus, is unlikely to cause any signal disruption due to occultation, giving a base map error of <2 parts per million.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we examine over 14,000 radio galaxies finely selected from Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) project and provide classifications for approximately 5,900 FRIs and 8,100 FRIIs. We present an analysis of these predicted radio galaxy morphologies for the RGZ catalogue, classified using a pre-trained radio galaxy foundation model that has been fine-tuned to predict Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphology. As seen in previous studies, our results show overlap between morphologically classified FRI and FRII luminosity-size distributions and we find that the model's confidence in its predictions is lowest in this overlap region, suggesting that source morphologies are more ambiguous. We identify the presence of low-luminosity FRII sources, the proportion of which, with respect to the total number of FRIIs, is consistent with previous studies. However, a comparison of the low-luminosity FRII sources found in this work with those identified by previous studies reveals differences that may indicate their selection is influenced by the choice of classification methodology. We investigate the impacts of both pre-training and fine-tuning data selection on model performance for the downstream classification task, and show that while different pre-training data choices affect model confidence they do not appear to cause systematic generalisation biases for the range of physical and observational characteristics considered in this work; however, we note that the same is not necessarily true for fine-tuning. As automated approaches to astronomical source identification and classification become increasingly prevalent, we highlight training data choices that can affect the model outputs and propagate into downstream analyses.",

Using an updated version of the GAMETE/QSOdust semi-analytical model, we implement a simple dust shielding prescription that accounts for the absorption of LW photons by dust grains. We find that even modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation field, allowing H2 cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation, particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H2 cooling. Our results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of different seed populations.

We include J-band data of four additional targets obtained with the three-channel camera at the 2m Fraunhofer telescope at the Wendelstein Observatory. We complement the new J-band photometric catalogue with forced photometry in the i- and z-bands of the tenth data release of the Legacy Survey (LSDR10) to derive the radial colour distribution around the eRASS1 clusters. Without assuming a priori to find a cluster red sequence at a specific colour, we try to find a radially weighted colour over-density to confirm the presence of high-redshift optical counterparts for the X-ray emission. We compare our confirmation with optical properties derived in earlier works based on LSDR10 data to refine the existing high-redshift cluster confirmation of eROSITA-selected clusters. We attempt to calibrate the colour-redshift-relation including the new J-band data by comparing our obtained photometric redshift estimate with the spectroscopic redshift of a confirmed, optically selected, high-redshift galaxy cluster. We confirm 9 out of 18 of the selected galaxy cluster candidates with a radial over-density of similar coloured galaxies for which we provide a photometric redshift estimate. We can report an increase in the relative colour measurement precision from 8% to 4% when including J-band data. In conclusion, our findings indicate a not insignificant spurious contaminant fraction at the high-redshift end (BEST_Z > 0.9) of the eROSITA/eRASS1 galaxy cluster catalogue, as well as it underlines the necessity for wide and deep near infrared imaging data for confirmation and characterisation of high-$z$ galaxy clusters.",

In this study, we adopt 12 cases with side-on bars (three simulated galaxies, each with four different projections). We decompose these galaxies into different structures combining the kinematic and morphological properties of stellar orbits, and compare the model-predicted components to their true counterparts in the simulations. Our models can identify (BP/X-shaped) bars, spheroidal bulges, thin disks, and spatially diffuse stellar halos. The mass fractions of bars and disks are well constrained with absolute biases $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.15$. The mass fractions of halos are recovered with $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.03$. For the bulge components, 10 of 12 cases have $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.05$, while the other two cases have $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.10$. Then, by tagging the stellar orbits with ages and metallicities, we derive the chemical properties of each structure. For stellar ages, our models recover the negative gradients in the bars and disks, but exhibit relatively larger uncertainties for age gradients in the bulges and halos. The mean stellar ages of all components are constrained with absolute biases $|t_{\\rm model}-t_{\\rm true}|\\rm\\lesssim1\\,Gyr$. For stellar metallicities, our models reproduce the steep negative gradients of the bars and bulges, and all different kinds of metallicity gradients in the disks and halos.

As we show, the de Sitter subspace of the $F(R,\\phi)$ system shares the same fixed points as the vacuum $F(R)$ gravity system and the trajectories in the phase space tend to these fixed points. However, the power-law subspace is not stable and cannot be realized by the combined $F(R,\\phi)$ system. To this end, we propose a well-motivated phenomenological $F(R)$ gravity model for which the $R^2$ term is switched off below a critical curvature near the end of the $R^2$ slow-roll inflationary era, and below that critical curvature, only the Einstein-Hilbert gravity term and the scalar field remain in the effective inflationary Lagrangian.

Here, we show that, after the Moon reached synchronous rotation, Earthshine could induce global circulation in lunar magma ocean due to the imposed surface temperature gradient generated by the hot, post-giant impact Earth. The global circulation, generating downwellings on the farside and a deeper return flow on the nearside, results that magmas flow from the nearside to the farside in the shallow magma ocean while the the direction of flow is opposite in the deep magma ocean. Such flow in the shallow magma ocean would transport anorthositic crystals formed in the nearside to the farside. Furthermore, since the lunar farside is cooler than the nearside, crystallization is much more efficient at the farside, resulting that farside magmas transported from the nearside produce anorthositic crystals rapidly. The theory proposed here may provide a natural way of explaining the origin of the lunar farside highlands.",

Our study incorporates 26 data points across ultraviolet to near-infrared, sourced from published literature, unpublished data, and new observations. In addition, archival XMM-Newton spectra were used to represent the X-ray emission. Care was taken to use out-of-eclipse flux measurements when the irradiated side of the companion faces the observer. The SED model includes contributions from a central source, a reprocessed accretion disk, and an irradiated companion star atmosphere, resulting in a good match to the observed fluxes. The revised and new parameters for the disk and the central source align with previous studies and match expectations for such systems. The temperature of the irradiated side of the companion star was estimated based on its B-V colour during the secondary eclipse. This work highlights the importance of broad wavelength coverage for understanding the properties of supersoft X-ray sources.",

Our results reveal anti-correlations between the Hurst index and the burst durations (T50, T90), and a negative trend with the low-energy spectral index \\alpha. We also find that correlations with peak photon flux are strongest at the shorter timescale (64 ms) and systematically weaken at longer timescales (256-1024 ms), indicating that the persistence of temporal correlations is most evident in the rapid variability component of GRB emission.

        "abstract": "Aims. We explore frequency-dependent changes in pulsar radio emission by analyzing their profile widths and emission heights, assessing whether the simple radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) or the fan beam model can describe the data. Methods. Using wideband (704-4032 MHz) Murriyang (Parkes) observations of over 100 pulsars, we measured profile widths at multiple intensity levels, fit Gaussian components, and used aberration-retardation effects to estimate emission altitudes. We compared trends in width evolution and emission height with a fan beam model. Results. Similar to other recent studies, we find that while many pulsars show profiles narrowing with increasing frequency, a substantial fraction show the reverse. The Gaussian decomposition of the profiles reveals that the peak locations of the components vary little with frequency. However, the component widths do, in general, narrow with increasing frequency. This argues that propagation effects are responsible for the width evolution of the profiles rather than emission height. Overall, the evolution of the emission height with frequency is unclear, and clouded by the assumptions in the model. Spin-down luminosity correlates weakly with profile narrowing but not with emission height. Conclusions. The classic picture where pulsars emit at a single emission height which decreases with increasing observing frequency cannot explain the diversity in behavior observed here. Instead, pulsar beams likely originate from extended regions at multiple altitudes, with fan-beam or patchy structures dominating their frequency evolution. Future models must incorporate realistic plasma physics and multi-altitude emission to capture the range of pulsar behaviors.",

Using the $\\mathtt{startrack}$ and COSMIC population synthesis codes, we investigate how different supernova mechanisms affect the observable population of SL systems, with particular attention to the mass gap (2$\\mathrm{-}$5 M$_\\odot$) in compact object distributions. We test three supernova remnant formation models with different convective growth timescales ($f_{\\rm mix}$ = 0.5, 1.0, and 4.0), simulating SL binary systems across the Galactic disk and bulge. We identify distinct groupings of SL sources based on lens mass and Einstein crossing time, clearly differentiating neutron star from black hole systems and close from wide orbits. Notably, the delayed $f_{\\rm mix} = 0.5$ model predicts a significantly higher fraction of systems with lens masses in the mass gap region (up to $\\sim10$ times more for certain surveys), suggesting that SL observations could help constrain this controversial population. Our analysis reveals a strong preference for systems with low centre-of-mass velocities ($v_{\\rm cm}\\leq20$ km/s) across all models, resulting primarily from physical processes governing compact object formation and binary survival. While many potential detections will have limited observational coverage, ZTF is predicted to yield several dozen well-covered systems that should enable detailed characterization. When applying simple detection criteria including photometric precision and signal-to-noise requirements, predicted rates decrease by approximately two orders of magnitude, but still yield up to a few tens of expected detections for LSST and ZTF in the Galactic disk population.",

Through this analysis, we found that the light curves of three events including OGLE-2024-BLG-0657, KMT-2024-BLG-2017, and KMT-2024-BLG-2480 cannot be readily interpreted using standard three-body lensing models such as a binary lens with a single source (2L1S) or a single lens with a binary source (1L2S). In this work we present detailed analyses of these events to uncover the nature of their anomalous features. An initial analysis using 2L1S modeling of the light curves showed that while it was difficult to simultaneously explain all of the multiple anomaly features, the main anomaly feature could be accounted for. Based on this model, we conducted four-body modeling that includes an additional lens or source. Through this approach, we found that the complex anomalies observed in the three events could be explained by a 2L2S model, in which both the lens and the source are binaries. Analysis of the color and magnitude revealed that the source is a binary system consisting of G- and K-type main sequence stars for OGLE-2024-BLG-0657, two K-type main sequence stars for KMT-2024-BLG-2017, and a K-type star with an early G-type main sequence companion for KMT-2024-BLG-2480. A Bayesian analysis incorporating constraints from the lensing observables indicates that the lenses in KMT-2024-BLG-2017 and KMT-2024-BLG-2480 are likely binary systems of low-mass stars located in the Galactic bulge, whereas the lens system OGLE-2024-BLG-0657L is likely a binary composed of two stellar remnants situated in the Galactic disk.",

In most studies, these relations have been obtained for large portions of the galaxies (i.e., on kpc scales), but it is also important to evaluate these relations in smaller scales. In this work, we used optical data cubes of a subsample of nearby galaxies of the DIVING 3D survey. These allowed us to analyze the scaling relations involving stellar velocity dispersion, stellar population age, and stellar population metallicity at the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of galaxies. We detected correlations between the stellar velocity dispersion and the age, metallicity, and total stellar mass. These correlations are independent of galaxy inclinations, considering all morphological types, nuclear activity, and the presence or absence of galactic bars. We detected, for the first time, a correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion and stellar metallicity in the nuclear regions of galaxies. It is found to be qualitatively consistent with the well-known stellar mass-metallicity relation. We also noted that barred galaxies tend to show younger and less metal-rich stellar populations than unbarred galaxies in the central regions, which may be a consequence of the bar triggering star formation in the nuclear regions of these objects. Some active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in our sample are positioned above the observed correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and stellar population age, suggesting that their nuclear stellar populations are younger than expected. This may be a consequence of positive AGN feedback, triggering star formation. Conversely, starburst galaxies do not show nuclear stellar populations at ages over one billion years.",

We demonstrate that high-precision cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments like the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), though designed for cosmology, offer a unique capability for such time-domain science due to their high cadence and broad sky coverage in millimeter bands. While previous ACT searches have focused on transients lasting minutes or longer, we develop and validate analysis methods to search for periodic, millisecond-scale transients, a capability not typically associated with CMB experiments. We describe a phase-resolved mapmaking approach, which leverages the known periodicity of the signal to enhance sensitivity and offers advantages in diagnosing systematic errors. We also introduce a template-based fit to the raw data timestreams that independently validate our results. Applying these methods to estimate the millimeter flux of the Crab Pulsar (PSR B0531+21), we derive 95% confidence upper limits of 4.6 mJy, 4.4 mJy, and 20.7 mJy on the pulsar's period-averaged flux density at 96 GHz, 148 GHz, and 225 GHz, respectively. These constraints fill a gap in our knowledge of the Crab Pulsar's spectral energy distribution, suggesting that it does not significantly flatten or invert at millimeter wavelengths.

Stars that form in or are captured by AGN disks will grow and migrate inward, potentially exploding as supernovae once the inner cold accretion disk disappears during the phase of AGN decay. We propose that tidal disruption of a supernova (TDS) by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can produce nuclear transients that are even more luminous than typical TDEs and are not limited by the SMBH mass. In this scenario, the SMBH can capture the supernova ejecta, which subsequently self-intersects and circularizes into an accretion disk. Based on hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the accretion rate of the TDS disk exhibits a slow decline that can last for months to decades. The peak accretion rate of a typical core-collapse SN scenario can exceed the Eddington limit for SMBHs with $M_{\\rm BH} \\lesssim 10^{7.5}\\,M_\\odot$, while it remains sub-Eddington for more massive SMBHs. This model provides a mechanism for triggering an energetic TDE-like flare with luminosity \\(\\gtrsim10^{45}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}\\) in galaxies with $M_{\\rm BH}\\gtrsim10^{8}\\,M_\\odot$ or triggering turn-on changing-look AGNs.",

        "abstract": "Periodic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGN) light curves has been proposed as a signature of close supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. Recently, 181 candidate SMBH binaries were identified in Gaia DR3 based on periodicity in their $\\sim$1000-day light curves. By supplementing Gaia photometry with longer-baseline light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey (CRTS), we test whether the reported periodic signals persist beyond the Gaia DR3 time window. We find that in all 116 cases with available ZTF data, the Gaia-inferred periodic model fails to predict subsequent variability, which appears stochastic rather than periodic. The periodic candidates thus overwhelmingly appear to be false positives; red noise contamination appears to be the primary source of false detections. We conclude that truly periodic AGN are exceedingly rare, with at most a few in $10^6$ AGN exhibiting stable periodicity on 100 to 1000 day timescales. Models predict that the Gaia AGN light curve sample should contain dozens of true SMBH binaries with periods within the observational baseline, so the lack of strictly periodic light curves in the sample suggests that most short-period binary AGN do not have light curves dominated by simple periodicity.",

Using $\\gamma$-ray, X-ray, optical/UV, and infrared data assembled from the Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center, we constructed multi-band light curves and temporally resolved spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of PKS 2155-304 to probe the origin of its emission. The light curves show significant variability, with fractional variability peaking at 0.75 in X-rays, 0.4 in the optical/UV, and 0.65 in $\\gamma$-ray band-consistent with expectations for HSPs. Segmenting the $\\gamma$-ray light curve with Bayesian blocks, we defined 253 time-resolved epochs with adequate multi-band coverage and categorized them into quiescent states (QS), multiwavelength flares (MWF), $\\gamma$-ray flares ($\\gamma$F), X-ray flares (XF), and optical/UV flares (OUF). Each SED is modeled within a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) framework that self-consistently evolves particle injection and cooling; a neural-network surrogate is used to accelerate parameter inference. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests reveal state-dependent parameter variations relative to QS: (i) during MWF, the magnetic field B, electron luminosity $L_{e}$, maximum electron Lorentz factor $\\gamma_{max}$, and Doppler factor $\\delta$ differ significantly; (ii) during $\\gamma$F, a harder electron index p is estimated; (iii) XF shows higher B and $\\gamma_{max}$ with a more compact emitting region; and (IV) during OUF, changes in B, $L_{e}$, $\\gamma_{max}$, $\\delta$, and p are found while the emitting-zone size remains approximately constant. The jet power is electron-dominated (magnetic-to-electron power ratio $\\eta_{B}\\simeq0.09-0.17$), with $\\eta_{B}$ rising during XF.

Focusing on the connected four-point autocorrelation function of gauge fields, we derive exact analytical expressions for the full trispectrum of both electric and magnetic fields using the in-in formalism and cosmological diagrammatic rules, and explore their respective contributions in specific momentum configurations. For the scalar exchange, we find that the trispectrum signal in the equisided configuration grows with the exchange momentum and reaches its maximum in the flattened limit. However, in the counter collinear limit, we show that the non-linearity parameter associated with the trispectrum scales quadratically with the corresponding parameter of the cross-correlation bispectrum of magnetic fields and curvature perturbations, thereby establishing a hierarchical relation between the higher- and lower-order correlation functions. For the tensor exchange, the trispectrum displays a richer angular dependence, reflecting the sensitivity to the orientation of the momentum quadrilateral with respect to the tensor polarisation, producing characteristic angular modulations in the trispectrum. Detecting such angular signatures in future high-precision cosmological observations would provide a novel window into tensor-mediated interactions in the early universe.",

        "abstract": "Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the small-scale primordial Universe and may constitute a fraction of the dark matter. Their formation is highly sensitive to non-Gaussian features in the primordial curvature perturbation $\\zeta$. In this work we investigate PBH production in the curvaton scenario, where the decay of a late-time light scalar field imprints large, inherently non-Gaussian fluctuations on small scales. Using the exact non-linear mapping between the Gaussian curvaton field perturbations and $\\zeta$, we compute the full non-perturbative probability distribution functions of $\\zeta$ and derive the PBH formation fraction $\\beta$ without relying on a truncated non-Gaussian expansion. We show that the enhanced tail of the distribution dramatically amplifies PBH production, leading to an exponential sensitivity of $\\beta$ to the curvaton decay fraction $\\Omega_{\\chi,\\rm dec}$. By modeling the scale dependence of curvaton fluctuations with a lognormal profile, we obtain realistic, extended PBH mass spectra rather than monochromatic peaks. We further highlight the associated stochastic gravitational-wave background induced at second order, whose peak frequency correlates directly with the PBH mass scale. Our results demonstrate that the curvaton scenario naturally produces a rich phenomenology of PBHs and gravitational waves, sharply distinct from Gaussian single-field inflation models, and provide a framework for connecting small-scale non-Gaussian physics to upcoming gravitational-wave and PBH observations.",

        "abstract": "Erupting flux ropes play crucial role in powering a wide range of solar transients, including flares, jets, and coronal mass ejections. These events are driven by the release of stored magnetic energy, facilitated by the shear in the complex magnetic topologies. However, the mechanisms governing the formation and eruption of flux ropes, particularly the role of magnetic shear distribution in coronal arcades are not fully understood. We employ magnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating nonadiabatic effects of optically thin radiative losses, magnetic field-aligned thermal conduction, and spatially varying (steady) background heating, to realistically model the coronal environment. A stratified solar atmosphere under gravity is initialized with a non-force-free field comprising sheared arcades. We study two different cases by varying the initial shear to analyze their resulting dynamics, and the possibility of flux rope formation and eruptions. Our results show that strong initial magnetic shear leads to spontaneous flux rope formation and eruption via magnetic reconnection, driven by Lorentz force. The shear distribution infers the non-potentiality distributed along arcades and demonstrates its relevance in identifying sites prone to eruptive activity. The evolution of mean shear and the relative strength between guide to reconnection fields during the pre- and post-eruption phases are explored, with implications of bulk heating for the ``hot onset'' phenomena in flares, and particle acceleration. On the other hand, the weaker shear case does not lead to formation of any flux ropes. Our findings highlight the limitations of relying solely on foot point shear and underscore the need for coronal scale diagnostics. These results are relevant for understanding eruptive onset conditions and can promote a better interpretation of coronal observations from current and future missions.",

There remains much mystery about how or if wave-energy in the photosphere can be transferred sufficiently upwards through the solar atmosphere to contribute to coronal heating. In light of a plethora of theoretical and idealised studies, we must complement our understanding with realistic and self-driven simulations in order to confidently quantify such contributions. Aims. In this study we aim to connect the various environments from the photosphere to low corona and identify wave drivers, transitions and dissipation mechanisms. We will analyse the effects of the presence of twisted magnetic features and vortical flows on the transport of such wave modes as the structures evolve. Methods. We adopt the most significant frequency (MSF) decomposition method to trace wave activity through a 3D realistic quiet Sun simulation. We focus on vertical and temporal evolution, identifying wave sources and shifts in the dominant modes. Results. We identify two frequencies, at 3.5 and 5 mHz, that connect oscillations in the upper convection zone to the dynamics in the solar atmosphere. We see distinct differences in the absence and presence of swirling structures on the upwards propagation of these oscillations. Furthermore, we validate the use of the highest frequency MSFs as a proxy for the location of shocks in the chromosphere, and use the results to understand the connection between shocks and the propagation of oscillations in the upper atmosphere. We discuss the relation of energy transfer via shocks, mode conversion, and jets. Finally, we find the contribution of 3.5 and 5 mHz signals to the overall wave power in the domain to be significant, up to 50%.",

Most of our previous studies are focused on jets and CMEs in single null-point topologies. Here, we investigate the initiation of CMEs and associated particle acceleration in a double null-point (or nested fan-spine) topology during multiple homologous M- and X-class flares from an active region. The initiation of the flare and associated eruption begins with inflow structures moving towards the inner null of the closed fan-spine topology. The first explosive breakout reconnection of the flux rope at the inner null produced a circular and remote ribbons along with successful eruption of the flux rope and associated fast EUV (shock) wave. Simultaneous flare reconnection beneath the erupting flux rope produced a typical two-ribbon flare along with two hard X-ray footpoint sources. When the flux rope (with shock) reaches the outer null, the second explosive breakout reconnection produces another large-scale remote ribbon. The radio observations reveal quasiperiodic Type III bursts (period=100-s) and a Type II burst during the breakout reconnection near the inner and outer nulls, along with gradual solar energetic particles (SEPs) observed at 1 AU for magnetically connected events. This study highlight the importance of two successive breakout reconnection in the initiation of CMEs in nested-null topologies and associated particle acceleration/release into the interplanetary medium. The particles are accelerated by the shock ahead of the flux rope, which formed during the inner breakout reconnection. These findings have significant implications for particle acceleration and escape processes in multi-scale null-point topologies that produce jets and CMEs.",

Here, we show that most of daily and hourly periodic variations in visible light brightness of the high corona (up to 15 Rs) are aligned to the tip of streamers and are consistent with the periodicity of plasma release from simulations of tearing-induced magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current sheet. The areas in which we detect periodicities can be used as tracers of non-quiescent fine coronal rays. This also allows their distinction from coronal rays more likely to be real quiescent features or associated with smaller and/or faster unresolved brightness variations. In the low- and middle-corona (down to 1.4 Rs) similar brightness variations are observed along loop-like and cusp-like features marking boundaries of streamers which then connect to radial features in the high corona. This suggests the presence of additional mechanisms in the low- and middle-corona periodically releasing density structures in the solar wind. The periodicity distributions show a solar cycle modulation with shorter periods (smaller structures) during solar maximum. Periodicities are observed within streamers during solar minimum, but are visible at all latitudes, even extending radially from the poles, during solar maximum.",

        "abstract": "The physics-determined broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars have been widely used to study the property during their flaring/outburst states, while the non-flaring state takes up most of their lifetime and the general property of blazars has been barely discussed. In this work, for the first time, we used the archival data and employed the physics-determined SED processing method to form approximately average-state SEDs for 513 \\textit{Fermi} bright BL Lacs. In general, we found that the magnetic field ($B$) is weaker than those obtained for flaring/outburst state by nearly one order of magnitude, and the dissipation region size ($R$) is larger than those obtained for flaring/outburst state, suggesting that the dissipation region could be more extend and less magnetized. A correlation between the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) peak frequency ($\\log \\nu_{\\rm ssc}$) against the synchrotron peak frequency ($\\log \\nu_{\\rm sy}$) suggest that the inverse Compton scattering of HBLs suffer a significant Klein-Nishina (KN) suppression, we quantified the condition of KN suppression by determining the critical synchrotron peak frequency ($\\nu_{\\rm sy}^{\\rm c}$) and found 359 out of 513 sources in our sample suffer KN suppression. Furthermore, our analysis of the relationship between synchrotron curvature ($1/b_{\\rm sy}$) and $\\log \\nu_{\\rm sy}$ indicates that the energy-dependent probability acceleration (EDPA) mechanism may dominate the particle acceleration in BL Lac jets.",

        "title": "Exploring Multi-view Symbolic Regression methods in physical sciences",
        "abstract": "Describing the world behavior through mathematical functions help scientists to achieve a better understanding of the inner mechanisms of different phenomena. Traditionally, this is done by deriving new equations from first principles and careful observations. A modern alternative is to automate part of this process with symbolic regression (SR). The SR algorithms search for a function that adequately fits the observed data while trying to enforce sparsity, in the hopes of generating an interpretable equation. A particularly interesting extension to these algorithms is the Multi-view Symbolic Regression (MvSR). It searches for a parametric function capable of describing multiple datasets generated by the same phenomena, which helps to mitigate the common problems of overfitting and data scarcity. Recently, multiple implementations added support to MvSR with small differences between them. In this paper, we test and compare MvSR as supported in Operon, PySR, phy-SO, and eggp, in different real-world datasets. We show that they all often achieve good accuracy while proposing solutions with only few free parameters. However, we find that certain features enable a more frequent generation of better models. We conclude by providing guidelines for future MvSR developments.",

        "abstract": "It is anticipated that mass accretion rates exceeding approximately $10^{19}\\,{\\rm g\\,s^{-1}}$ in X-ray pulsars lead to radiation-driven outflows from super-critical accretion discs. The outflows launched from the disc influence the angular distribution of X-ray radiation, resulting in geometrical beaming. The beaming, in turn, impacts the apparent luminosity of the X-ray pulsar, detectability of pulsations, and the spectral composition of the X-ray flux. We employ a straightforward geometrical model of the outflows, perform Monte Carlo simulations, and model the spectra of radiation, reprocessed by the walls of the accretion cavity formed by the outflows. We consider the reprocessed emission only; direct pulsar emission is not included in our modelling. Our results demonstrate that the spectra of reprocessed radiation depend on the actual luminosity of the central engine, the geometry of the outflows, and the viewing angle - most notably on the latter, through changing visibility of the hotter wall regions near the disc plane. The high-energy part of the reprocessed spectrum depends strongly on viewing angle (harder at lower inclinations), while the soft flux varies comparatively little with inclination. In our model, this contrast is a prediction: variable ultra-luminous X-ray sources are expected to exhibit strong high-energy angle sensitivity together with comparatively modest soft-band variation, naturally arising if precession modulates the effective inclination.",

Using the exact general relativistic solution for the magnetic field, we analyze particle motion both analytically and numerically, identifying regions of stable and unstable orbits. In particular, we classify charged particle dynamics into attractive and repulsive Lorentz force configurations and show that in the attractive case, charged particles can accumulate near the current loop, forming collective currents that oppose the original current loop magnetic field. We demonstrate that charged particle accumulation can lead to the formation of toroidal structures analogous to radiation belts in the BH magnetosphere. We compare the curved spacetime solution to flat spacetime analogs and highlight general relativistic effects such as the existence of the innermost stable circular orbit for charged particles, which sets a lower bound for radiation belt formation. The divergence of the vector potential at the loop location in the idealized infinitesimal loop model is addressed, and we argue that a physically realistic model must consider a finite-width current distribution to avoid unphysical divergences in the effective potential.",

        "abstract": "Solar white-light flares (WLFs) have been observed since 1859, but their occurrence rate is not yet fully understood. The physical properties of WLFs in super active regions (SARs) are also well worth investigating. With full-disk images at 3600 {\\AA} (in the Balmer continuum) from the White-light Solar Telescope (WST) on board the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory, we here study the M- and X-class WLFs occurring in SAR NOAA 13664/13697 (a same region in two solar Carrington rotations) during May/June 2024. 48 WLFs at 3600 {\\AA} are identified from 89 available samples with an occurrence rate of 53.9%, which is much higher than that (23.9%) of a longterm-continuous data set from October 2022 to May 2023 in our previous work (Jing et al. 2024). In particular, with an additional sample of over 730 M- and X-class flares from October 2022 to June 2024, we find that the occurrence rate of WLFs shows a good correlation with the solar cycle represented by sunspot counts. As regards the properties of the emission at 3600 {\\AA}, the WLFs in SAR NOAA 13664/13697 have some different characteristics, say, a longer duration but a weaker relative enhancement and a smaller brightening area compared with the previous long-term-continuous sample. We also find that for WLFs in NOAA 13664/13697 the relation between the duration and energy at 3600 {\\AA} is described by a power-law with index of 0.35, which is similar to the results found for superflares in Sun-like stars (Kowalski 2024). All these help us understand the solar WLFs in SARs and also provide important insights into the superflares on Sun-like stars.",

        "abstract": "We present the discovery of three new low-latitude (|b| ~ 20$^{\\circ}$) Milky Way satellites: Yasone-1, Yasone-2, and Yasone-3. They were identified in our search for compact stellar overdensities in the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1, supported by follow-up deep photometric imaging from the Gran Telescopio Canarias OSIRIS instrument and Gaia astrometric data. These three new Milky Way satellites are found as compact stellar overdensities that exhibit structural and photometric properties consistent with old, metal-poor populations. All three are best described by isochrone fits corresponding to an age of ~12 Gyr and subsolar metallicities: [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 for Yasone-1 and Yasone-2, and [Fe/H] ~ -2.0 for Yasone-3. Yasone-1, located at a heliocentric distance of 12 kpc, has a physical half-light radius of 1.40 pc, an absolute V-band magnitude of +2.36, and a total stellar mass of 18.2 M$_{\\odot}$. Yasone-2, at a distance of 20 kpc, has a slightly larger size of 2.44 pc, a brighter V-band magnitude of +1.83, and a higher mass of 28.0 M$_{\\odot}$. Yasone-3, located at 15 kpc, is the faintest and least massive of the three, with M$_{V}$ = +2.52, a stellar mass of 14.4 M$_{\\odot}$, and a half-light radius of 2.09 pc. We also report a fourth (Yasone-4), lower-confidence hypercompact candidate located at Galactic latitude (b ~ 48$^{\\circ}$), identified by replicating our search using the photometric catalogue of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Public Release. Finally, we present the discovery of sixteen (Yasone-5 to Yasone-20) new hypercompact cluster candidates in the Galactic disc. We discuss the possibility that any of the Yasone clusters may host an intermediate-mass black hole, and we advocate for follow-up spectroscopic observations to further constrain their nature.",

        "abstract": "Velocity dispersion ($\\sigma$) in stellar streams from globular clusters (GCs) is sensitive to heating by Galactic substructure, including dark matter (DM) subhalos. Recent studies have compared $\\sigma$ in observed and modeled streams to probe DM properties, but have relied on stream models that neglect strong encounters, black holes (BHs), and mass segregation in GCs. Such phenomena may inflate stream $\\sigma$ or introduce selection effects -- e.g., a $\\sigma$ that depends on star mass ($m$). We investigate this prospect using Monte Carlo $N$-body simulations of GCs under static Galactic tides to generate mock streams with realistic mass and velocity distributions. We find $\\sigma$ correlates with $m$, especially after core collapse (the GC's observable increase in central density upon ejecting its BHs), rising from $1.2$--$2.2\\,{\\rm km\\,s}^{-1}$ between $m=0.3$--$0.8\\,M_\\odot$, with typical kinematic cuts on stream membership. Similar in magnitude to heating by Galactic substructure, this enhancement occurs because the GC's loss of BHs allows its most-massive stars to occupy its dense center, raising their likelihood of strong ejection via binary interactions and adding broad, exponential wings to the stream's velocity distribution. Streams' kinematics thus probe properties (density, BH retention) of their progenitor GCs. Our results also imply observations of streams from some GCs, especially those not subject to highly episodic mass loss, may select for higher $\\sigma$ than predicted by models neglecting $\\sigma$'s $m$-dependence. This would cause observed $\\sigma$ in streams -- already on the low side of expectations for cold DM -- to further favor alternatives such as warm, ultralight, or self-interacting DM.",

The atomic gas in AGC 727130 displays a pronounced asymmetry, extending well beyond the stellar disk in one direction while remaining relatively undisturbed in the other. Despite proximity to a pair of interacting dwarfs, tidal analysis suggests these neighboring galaxies are not responsible for this pronounced asymmetry. Instead, using a topological cosmic web filament finder on spectroscopic catalogue data, we find AGC 727130 lies at the intersection of several large-scale cosmic web filaments, environments predicted to host diffuse, shock-heated gas. We propose that an interaction with this ambient medium is stripping gas from the galaxy via cosmic web ram-pressure stripping. This mechanism, supported by recent simulations, may quench low-mass galaxies outside of massive halos, and must be accounted for when comparing observed numbers of dwarf galaxies to theoretical predictions.",

        "abstract": "We present a new method to search for strong gravitational lensing systems by pairing spectra that are close together on the sky in a spectroscopic survey. We visually inspect 26,621 spectra in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 that are selected in this way. We further inspect the 11,848 images corresponding to these spectra in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10, and obtain 2046 conventional strong gravitational lens candidates, of which 1906 are new. This constitutes the largest sample of lens candidates identified to date in spectroscopic data. Besides the conventional candidates, we identify a new class of systems that we term \"dimple lenses\". These systems have a low-mass foreground galaxy as a lens, typically smaller in angular extent and fainter compared with the lensed background source galaxy, producing subtle surface brightness indentations in the latter. We report the discovery of 318 of these \"dimple-lens\" candidates. We suspect that these represent dwarf galaxy lensing. With follow-up observations, they could offer a new avenue to test the cold dark matter model by probing their mass profiles, stellar mass-halo mass relation, and halo mass function for $M_{\\textrm{Halo}} \\lesssim 10^{13}\\,M_\\odot$. Thus, in total, we report 2164 new lens candidates.

        "abstract": "Stars form in clusters from the gravitational collapse of giant molecular clouds, which is opposed by a variety of physical processes, including stellar feedback. The interplay between these processes determines the star formation rate of the clouds. To study how feedback controls star formation, we use a numerical framework that is optimized to simulate star cluster formation and evolution. This framework, called Torch, combines the magnetohydrodynamical code FLASH with N-body and stellar evolution codes in the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE). Torch includes stellar feedback from ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae, but, until now, did not include protostellar jets. We present our implementation of protostellar jet feedback within the Torch framework and describe its free parameters. We then demonstrate our new module by comparing cluster formation simulations with and without jets. We find that the inclusion of protostellar jets slows star formation, even in clouds of up to M $= 2 \\times 10^4$ M$_{\\odot}$. We also find that the star formation rate of our lower mass clouds (M $= 5 \\times 10^3$ M$_{\\odot}$) is strongly affected by both the inclusion of protostellar jets and the chosen jet parameters, including the jet lifetime and injection velocity. We follow the energy budget for each simulation and find that the inclusion of jets systematically increases the kinetic energy of the gas at early times. The implementation of protostellar jet feedback in Torch opens new areas of investigation regarding the role of feedback in star cluster formation and evolution.",

        "abstract": "SDSS-V will obtain 100,000s of medium-resolution, optical spectra of M dwarfs with the BOSS instrument. M dwarfs have complex atmospheres, and their spectra contain many wide and dense, overlapping molecular features, so determining accurate stellar parameters by fitting models has been difficult. To circumvent this, other surveys have employed machine learning methods to transfer measurements of stellar parameters from high-resolution spectra to their medium-resolution counterparts. These methods provide large catalogs of stellar parameters but, if not addressed properly, are plagued by biases which are, in part, due to the normalization of the spectra. Typical spectral normalization removes the continuum but preserves the relative depths of the absorption features, but optical M dwarf spectra are almost entirely made up of molecular absorption, which makes this difficult. Here, we develop a standardization method that instead defines a pseudo-continuum. We use the spectrum's alpha shape to find the points which lie between the absorption features and apply local polynomial regression to find this pseudo-continuum. To tune the hyperparameters of this method, we create BOSS-like spectra from BT-NextGen models to replicate instrumental, signal-to-noise, and reddening effects. We find that in both this generated set and a validation set of the SDSS-V data, our method performs better than alternative standardizations by producing spectra that are both more uniform for M dwarfs with similar stellar parameters and more easily distinguished compared to M dwarfs of differing parameters. These results from our method will be crucial for better determining stellar parameters of M dwarfs using generative models.",

We find that the formation of these galaxies follows a two-phase pattern, with an early phase featured by hot dynamics, bulge-dominated structure and bursty star formation, and a later phase featured by cold dynamics, disk-dominated structure and steady star formation. The transition times of these galaxy properties are tightly correlated with the time when the host halo transits from fast to slow accretion, suggesting that the two-phase assembly of halos drive the two-phase formation of galaxies. The physical origin of dynamical hotness can be summarized into two modes of star formation: a scattered mode in which stars form at large radii within cold gas streams associated with fast assembly of halos, and a concentrated mode in which stars form at small radii through violent fragmentation from globally self-gravitated gas when halo assembly is about to slow down. Cold gaseous and stellar disks can form only when the conditions of the two modes are removed by the stall of halo assembly and the reduction of gas by feedback processes. The two modes of star formation leave distinct imprints on the structural properties of high-redshift galaxies, providing implications to be tested by JWST and future observations.",

        "abstract": "Post-RGB and post-AGB binaries consist of a primary star that has recently evolved off either the RGB or AGB after losing most of its envelope, and a main-sequence companion. They are distinguished by luminosities below and above the RGB tip, respectively. These systems host a stable, dusty circumbinary disc, characterised by a near-infrared excess. Observed Galactic post-AGB and post-RGB binaries have orbital periods and eccentricities inconsistent with binary population synthesis models. Here, we focus on post-RGB binaries, testing whether stable mass transfer can explain their orbital periods by comparing models with the known sample of 38 Galactic post-RGB binaries. We systematically determined luminosities of Galactic post-RGB and post-AGB binaries through SED fitting. We computed evolution models for low- and intermediate-mass binaries with RGB donors at two metallicities using MESA. We selected stable mass transfer models producing primaries with effective temperatures within the observed range. From these models, we find that low-mass post-RGB binaries should follow strict luminosity-orbital period relations. The Galactic post-RGB binaries seem consistent with these relations if their orbits remained eccentric during mass transfer and if the donor filled its Roche lobe at periastron. However, our models are unable to explain the eccentricities themselves. Moreover, post-mass-transfer ages from our models are much longer than predicted dissipation timescales of circumbinary discs. Stable mass transfer seems to explain the orbital periods of Galactic post-RGB binaries. This formation channel can be tested further by obtaining orbits of additional Galactic systems and Magellanic Cloud candidates via long-term radial velocity monitoring. Gaia DR 4 will improve luminosities of Galactic post-RGB binaries, enabling more accurate comparison with luminosity-orbital period relations.",

        "abstract": "We present new VLT/MUSE mosaic observations of a 3 $\\times$ 8 arcmin$^2$ area along the southern major axis of the nearby galaxy M33 at a distance of 840 kpc from the Milky Way. These data provide an unprecedented view of the galaxy interstellar medium (ISM), and allow us to resolve ionised nebulae at a spatial scale of $\\approx$5 pc. We identify and catalogue 124 HII regions, down to H$\\alpha$ luminosities of $\\approx 5\\times$10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$, one order of magnitude fainter than previous surveys on local galaxies, and compare these regions with the spatial distribution of ionising stars and embedded star clusters. For each region, we extract the corresponding integrated optical spectra and measured the intensity of key optical emission lines (H$\\beta$, [OIII], [NII], H$\\alpha$, [SII], [SIII], other weaker optical lines when detectable, and Paschen lines) to characterize their physical properties of the ioinized gas such as density, dust attenuation, and metallicity. Our spatially resolved line ratio and flux maps reveal remarkable diversity in ionisation properties, from dust-obscured regions hosting young stellar objects to highly ionised bubbles exhibiting high [OIII]/H$\\beta$ ratios (>5). Our data reveal a diversity of ionisation fronts, ranging from well-defined to partial to absent. Radial profiles indicate the presence of both optically thin (density-bounded) and optically thick (radiation-bounded) HII regions. Our study highlights the richness of this MUSE mosaic and their unparalleled view of the ISM. In particular, the ability to probe the ISM at $\\approx$ 5 pc resolution opens a new window onto the complex structure of the ionised gas, enabling direct insight into how stellar feedback operates on the scales where it originates.",

        "abstract": "Disentangling the (co-)evolution of individual galaxy structural components remains a difficult task owing to the inability to cleanly isolate light from spatially overlapping components. In this pilot study of PGC 044931, observed as part of the GECKOS survey, we utilise VIRCAM $H$-band imaging to decompose the galaxy into five photometric components, three of which contribute $>50\\%$ of light in given regions: a main disc, a boxy/peanut bulge, and a nuclear disc. When the photometric decompositions are mapped onto MUSE observations, we find remarkably good separation in stellar kinematic space. All three structures occupy unique locations in the parameter space of the ratio of stellar line-of-sight velocity ($\\rm{V}_{\\star}$) and dispersion, ($\\sigma_{\\star}$), and high order stellar skew, ($h_{3}$). These clear and distinct kinematic signatures give us confidence to make inferences about the formation history of the individual components from observations of the mean light-weighted stellar age and metallicity of the three components. A clear story emerges: one in which an extended galactic disc hosted continued star formation, possibly with the addition of accreted pristine gas. Within the disc, a bar formed and buckled early, building a nuclear disc that continued to enrich via multiple generations of star formation. These results exemplify how careful photometric decompositions, combined with well-resolved stellar kinematic information, can help separate out age-metallicity relations of different components and therefore disentangle the formation history of the galaxy. The results of this pilot survey are applicable to modern, well-resolved spectroscopic galaxy surveys.",

Six of our targets -- the primary sample -- are massive, UV-luminous galaxies drawn from the REBELS survey, while the remaining two are UV-fainter galaxies that were previously serendipitously detected through their luminous [CII] lines in the REBELS fields. We detect [OIII]$_{88}$ emission in all eight galaxies at $6.2 - 17.7\\sigma$ significance, and find them to be consistent with the local dwarf galaxy relation between $L_\\mathrm{[OIII]}$ and star formation rate. Our sample spans [OIII]/[CII] $\\approx 1.9 - 9.6$, which is typical for the high-redshift galaxy population. Five of the primary targets benefit from JWST/NIRSpec observations, enabling a direct comparison of the [OIII]/[CII] ratio against rest-optical ISM diagnostics. We supplement our high-redshift sample with eleven $z\\approx6-14$ galaxies in the literature for which similar ALMA and JWST observations are available, and furthermore compare to the [OIII]/[CII] ratios measured for local dwarf galaxies. We find that, at fixed metallicity and ionization parameter, $z>6$ galaxies show elevated [OIII]/[CII] ratios compared to local dwarfs. Instead, we find that a large [OIII]$_{4959,5007}$+H$\\beta$ equivalent width -- a proxy for burstiness -- is the main driver of the high [OIII]/[CII] ratios seen in the early Universe, which is primarily due to [CII] being suppressed in bursty galaxies. Given the apparent validity of the [OIII]$_{88}$-SFR relation across most of cosmic time, as well as the abundance of young, bursty galaxies at high redshift, [OIII]$_{88}$ is set to remain a powerful ISM tracer at the cosmic dawn.",

We find that the transfer function, and hence imprint on the CMB and Large-Scale Structure (LSS), is characterized by a single characteristic scale of the interacting fuzzy dark sector, allowing us to recover the LSS signature of single-field FDM, dependent on the FDS parameters. In contrast, galactic halos present a great diversity, unlike with the universality of single-field FDM, owing to the interaction between fields. This interaction introduces an instability that is not otherwise present for the case of four decoupled scalars. Finally, we comment on primordial production and portals to the Standard Model, and introduce another simple realization of the Fuzzy Dark Sector paradigm with a kinetic coupling.",

Our calculation predicts that the extremely high recent star formation rate of $\\sim 100\\,M_{\\odot}\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ over the last 50 Myr (not accounting for image multiplicity) in the ``Cosmic Horseshoe'' lensed system ($z = 2.381$) generates many young, bright stars, of which their large abundance is expected to lead to a detection rate of $\\sim 60$ transients per pointing in {\\it JWST} observations with a $5\\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $\\sim 29\\,m_{AB}$. With the high expected detection rate and little room for uncertainty for the lens model compared with cluster lenses, our result suggests that the Cosmic Horseshoe could be an excellent tool to test the nature of Dark Matter based on the spatial distribution of transients, and can be used to constrain axion mass if Dark Matter is constituted of ultra-light axions. We also argue that the large distance modulus of $\\sim46.5\\,$mag at $z \\approx 2.4$ can act as a filter to screen out less massive stars as transients and allow one to better constrain the high-mass end of the stellar initial mass function based on the transient detection rate.

        "abstract": "Disks around very low-mass stars (VLMS) provide environments for the formation of Earth-like planets. Mid-infrared observations have revealed that these disks exhibit weak silicate features and strong hydrocarbon emissions. This study characterizes the dust properties and geometrical structures of VLMS and brown dwarf (BD) disks, observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and connects these to gas column density and potential evolutionary stages. We analyze mid-infrared spectra of ten VLMS and BD disks as a part of the MIRI mid-Infrared Disk Survey (MINDS) program. Spectral slopes and silicate band strengths are compared with hydrocarbon emission line ratios, which probe the gas column density. Moreover, the Dust Continuum Kit with Line emission from Gas is used to quantify grain sizes, dust compositions, and crystallinity in the disk surface. The disks are classified into less, more, and fully settled geometries based on their mid-infrared spectral slopes and silicate band strengths. Less-settled disks show a relatively strong silicate band, high spectral slopes, and low crystallinity, and are dominated by 5 $\\mu$m-sized grains. More-settled disks have weaker silicate band, low spectral slope, enhanced crystallinity, and higher mass fractions of smaller grains. Fully-settled disks exhibit little or no silicate emission and negative spectral slopes. An overall trend of increasing gas column density with decreasing spectral slope suggests that more molecular gas is exposed when the dust opacity decreases due to dust settling. Our findings may reflect possible evolutionary pathways with dust settling and thermal processing or may point to inner-disk clearing or a collisional cascade. These results highlight the need for broader samples to understand the link between dust and gas appearance in regions where Earth-like planets form.",

We investigate which survey configurations detect the 21cm-LAE cross-correlation signal, and assess its ability to distinguish reionisation scenarios. Our pipeline computes observational uncertainties for the 21cm-galaxy cross-power spectrum, accounting for key survey parameters: the field of view (FoV), limiting luminosity of galaxy surveys $L_\\alpha$, redshift uncertainty $\\sigma_z$, and 21cm foreground wedge assumptions. We calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the 21cm-Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitter (LAE) cross-power spectrum for two scenarios: one where reionisation is driven by faint or by bright galaxies. We find: (i) SNR increases with larger FoV, fainter $L_\\alpha$, and smaller $\\sigma_z$, with the FoV having the strongest impact when $\\sigma_z$ is small. (ii) Under a moderate foreground wedge, photometric-like surveys yield insufficient SNR, and medium-deep ($L_\\alpha\\gtrsim10^{42.5}$erg s$^{-1}$), wide-area (FoV>20deg$^2$) slitless spectroscopic surveys are needed. (iii) Under an optimistic foreground wedge, detection is possible with deep ($L_\\alpha\\gtrsim10^{42.3}$erg s$^{-1}$), wide-area (FoV$\\gtrsim80$deg$^2$) photometric-like or shallower, small-area (FoV$\\simeq2-3$deg$^2$) slitless spectroscopic surveys. (iv) To distinguish the two reionisation scenarios at z=7, moderate foreground wedge scenarios require deep-wide spectroscopic surveys; under an optimistic foreground wedge, shallower, medium-area (FoV$\\simeq10$deg$^2$) slitless spectroscopic surveys suffice. (v) Maximising the SNR for detection and model discrimination requires sampling the large-scale peak of the cross-power spectrum, which shifts to larger physical scales as reionisation proceeds and the less ionisation fronts follow the gas density - making surveys at z>7 more promising despite lower galaxy number densities.",

An object of such extreme nature challenges our understanding of galaxy formation, requiring rapid growth and quenching mechanisms only 0.6 Gyr after the Big Bang and implying number densities 2 dex higher than currently predicted by simulations. We use synthetic observables to identify analogous systems within the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) and find two massive galaxies dominated by rapidly quenched bursts. Beyond demonstrating that the current FLARES model is capable of producing RQG-like systems, these analogues provide a laboratory within which to study the underlying physics. Their active galactic nuclei (AGN) heat and expel gas, inducing rapid quenching and preventing timely rejuvenation. This causes above-average chemical enrichment at a given stellar mass, with super solar levels predicted for RQG. These metallicities are underestimated by spectral energy distribution fitting and we show that $\\alpha$-enhancement cannot be solely responsible. Degeneracies with age and dust attenuation appear the more likely causes. Tensions between observed and simulated number densities can be alleviated in part by considering systematics, but adjustments to AGN feedback, such as allowing super-Eddington accretion rates, may be required for full agreement.",

        "abstract": "The transport of cosmic rays through turbulent astrophysical plasmas still constitutes an open problem. Building on recent progress, we study the combined effect of magnetic mirroring and resonant curvature scattering on parallel and perpendicular transport. We conduct test particle simulations in snapshots of an anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics simulation, and record magnetic moment variation and field line curvature around pitch angle reversals. We find for strongly magnetized particles that (i) pitch angle reversals may occur either in coherent regions of the field with small variation of the magnetic moment via magnetic mirroring, or in chaotic regions of the field with strong variation of the magnetic moment via resonant curvature scattering; (ii) parallel transport can be modeled as a L\\'evy walk with a truncated power-law distribution based on pitch angle reversal times; and (iii) perpendicular transport is enhanced by resonant curvature scattering in synergy with chaotic field line separation, and diminished by magnetic mirroring due to confinement in locally ordered field line bundles. While magnetic mirroring constitutes the bulk of reversal events, resonant curvature scattering additionally acts on trajectories which fall in the loss cones of typical mirroring structures and thus provides the cut-off for the reversal time distribution. Our results, which highlight the role of the magnetic field line geometry in cosmic ray transport processes, are consistent with energy-independent diffusion coefficients. We conclude by considering how energy-dependent observations could arise from an intermittently inhomogeneous interstellar medium.",

        "abstract": "Context. The CAPOS project aims to obtain accurate mean abundances and radial velocities for many elements, and it explores the multiple population (MP) phenomenon in Galactic bulge globular clusters (BGCs). NGC 6569 is one of the CAPOS targets. Aims. This study provides a detailed high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of NGC 6569 to derive precise abundances for elements of different nucleosynthetic origins and to unveil its MPs by focusing on key spectral features. Methods. We analyzed APOGEE-2 near-infrared spectra of 11 giant members with the BACCHUS code, deriving abundances for 12 elements (C, N, O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni, Al, Ce, Nd). Isochrone fitting with Gaia+2MASS photometry was used to estimate atmospheric parameters, cluster distance, and extinction. Results. We obtained [Fe/H] = -0.91 $\\pm$ 0.06, consistent with APOGEE pipeline values; the scatter lies within uncertainties. The cluster shows [$\\alpha$/Fe] = 0.36 $\\pm$ 0.06 dex, similar to other GCs. Al appears homogeneous, while N is strongly enriched ([N/Fe] = 0.68 $\\pm$ 0.34) with a spread of 0.90 dex, yielding two populations anticorrelated in C. The n-capture elements Ce and Nd are overabundant compared to the Sun but consistent with GCs of similar metallicity, with $\\langle$[Ce/Nd]$\\rangle$ = -0.17 $\\pm$ 0.12. We also measure RV = -49.75 $\\pm$ 3.68 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with previous works, while d$_\\odot$ = 12.4 $\\pm$ 1.45 kpc and E(B-V) = 0.68 are both higher than literature values. Conclusions. MPs in NGC 6569 are confirmed through a clear C-N anticorrelation. The cluster shows [$\\alpha$/Fe] enhancement from Type II SNe and no Mg-Al-Si anticorrelation, suggesting rapid and homogeneous formation. The $\\langle$[Ce/Nd]$\\rangle$ ratio points to contributions from r-process events such as neutron star mergers, while overall Ce and Nd abundances are reported here for the first time in this cluster.",

        "abstract": "Strong shocks occurring in supernova remnants (SNRs), and their interaction with an often anisotropic surrounding medium, make SNRs ideal laboratories for studying the production and acceleration of cosmic rays (CRs). Due to their complex morphology and phenomenology, different CR populations are expected to exist throughout the remnants, each characterized by its own energy spectrum. A comprehensive understanding of particle acceleration mechanisms and energetics in SNRs requires spatially resolved spectral and morphological studies. We want to highlight the crucial role of high-resolution radio images at high frequencies (> 10 GHz) for studying the spectral properties of different remnant regions and better constraining the models that describe their non-thermal emission from radio to $\\gamma$-ray wavelengths. We studied the integrated radio spectrum of the SNR Kes 73 using single-dish observations performed with the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT) between 6.9 and 24.8 GHz, complemented by published data. The high-resolution map at 24.8 GHz was used to search for spatial variations in the spectral index across the remnant. We present the SRT images of Kes 73, providing the highest-frequency morphological and spectral characterization ever obtained for this source. By combining our 18.7 and 24.8 GHz maps with previously published interferometric images at 1.4 and 5 GHz, we identify a flatter spectrum in the western bright region compared to the rest of the shell. In the same region, we detect overlapping $^12$CO molecular emission and $\\gamma$-ray radiation, providing strong evidence of SNR-molecular cloud interaction and enhanced CR production. We modelled the non-thermal radio to $\\gamma$-ray emission from this region, favouring a lepto-hadronic scenario with a maximum electron energy of 1.1 TeV and a magnetic field strength of 25 $\\mu$G.",

        "abstract": "The canonical formation of second-generation (G2) stars in globular clusters (GCs) from gas enriched and ejected by G1 (primordial) polluters faces substantial challenges, i.e. (i) a mass-budget problem and (ii) uncertainty in the source(s) of the abundance anomaly of light elements (AALE) in G2 stars. The merger of G1 low-mass main-sequence (MS) binaries can overcome (i), but its ability to result in AALE is omitted. We provide evidence of the merger process to explain AALE by relying on highly probable merger remnants in the Galactic disk. We focus on carbon-deficient red-clump giants with low mass of 1.0 M_{\\sun} < M $\\lesssim$ 2.0 M_{\\sun} and hot He-intermediate subdwarfs of supersolar metallicity, both manifesting G2-like AALE incompatible with GC origin. The origin of such rare core He-burning stars as the mergers of [MS star (MSS)]+[helium white dwarf (HeWD)] binaries, evolved from low-mass high-mass ratio (MSS+MSS) ones, is supported by models evolving to either horizontal branch (HB) stars or He subdwarfs via the red giant branch (RGB). Such binaries in the GC NGC 362 contain very young ($\\sim$ 4 Myr) extremely low-mass HeWDs, in contrast to much older ($\\sim 100$ times) counterparts in open clusters. This agrees with the impact of GC environment on the lifetime of hard binaries: (MSS+HeWD) systems merge there soon after arising from (MSS+MSS) binaries that underwent the common-envelope stage of evolution. From the number and lifetime of the (MSS+HeWD) binaries uncovered in NGC 362, the expected fraction of their progeny RGB G2 stars is estimated to be $\\lesssim$10\\%. The field merger remnants with G2-like AALE support the merger nature of at least a fraction of G2 stars in GCs. The specific channel [(MSS+MSS) - (MSS+HeWD) - merger product] supported by observations and models is tentatively identified as the channel of formation of the extreme G2 RGB component in GCs.",

We implement a computational framework, dubbed CosmoGen, that integrates evolutionary algorithms for symbolic regression, with computation of structure formation and background cosmological quantities that are used to guide the evolutionary process. As a proof-of-concept we apply the procedure to the specific case of dark energy fluid models, and ask the framework to generate models capable of alleviating the cosmological tensions $S_8$ and $H_0$.

The method relies on generalized Pad\\'e-$(2,1)$ expansions around arbitrary pivot redshifts, which, compared to state-of-the-art calculations, reduce truncation errors by up to two orders of magnitude at high redshift and yield more precise constraints by defining cosmographic parameters exactly where the data lie. This avoids extrapolations, mitigates degeneracies, and enables a clean disentangling of their effects. Using the latest low-redshift datasets, we center the generalized expansion in multiple bins across $z\\in[0,1]$ and obtain precise constraints on the redshift evolution of cosmographic parameters. We find that all key parameters deviate from their $\\Lambda$CDM predictions in a redshift-dependent way that can be naturally explained within dynamical Dark Energy scenarios. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ follows a redshift evolution consistent with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization, while the generalized $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows deviations of up to $\\sim4\\sigma$ from the constant $\\Lambda$CDM expectation, closely matching the CPL predictions. Taken together, these results point to footprints of dynamical Dark Energy in the kinematics of the Universe at $z\\lesssim 1$.",

We validate our theoretical expressions for the specific case of an ideal fluid, using semi-numerical simulations of the linear response acoustic wake. We demonstrate that, for a finite time perturbation switched on at t=0, a steady dissipation state is reached after a time bounded by twice the sound crossing time of the apocentre distance. We apply our results to model the secular evolution of compact eccentric binaries in a gaseous medium, assuming low-density conditions where the orbital elements evolve adiabatically. For unequal-mass systems with moderate initial eccentricity, the late-time eccentricity growth is significantly delayed compared to the equal-mass case, due to the binary components becoming transonic at different times along their orbital trajectory. Our approach offers a computationally efficient alternative to full simulations of the linear response wake.",

Using RULES, we generate $uv$-complete layouts that cover the range $10\\lambda\\leq|(u,v)|\\leq 100\\lambda$ with fewer than 1000 antennas of diameter $5\\lambda$, comparable to current and planned arrays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such arrays for mitigating contamination from bright astrophysical foregrounds in 21 cm Epoch of Reionization observations,particularly in the region of Fourier space known as the foreground wedge,by simulating visibilities of foreground-like sky models over the 130-150 MHz band and processing them through an image-based power spectrum estimator. We find that with complete $uv$ coverage, the wedge power is suppressed by sixteen orders of magnitude compared to an array with a compact hexagonal layout (used as a reference for a sparse $uv$ coverage). In contrast, we show that an array with the same number of antennas but in a random configuration only suppresses the wedge by three orders of magnitude, despite sampling more distinct $uv$ points over the same range. We address real-world challenges and find that our results are sensitive to small antenna position errors and missing baselines, while still performing equally or significantly better than random arrays in any case.

Detecting these objects, compiling a population-level sample and constraining their occurrence will inform planet and moon formation models and shed light on moon habitability. Aims: Here, we demonstrate the possibility of a moon search based on astrometric time series data, repeated measurements of the position of a given planet relative to its host star. The perturbing influence of an orbiting moon induces a potentially detectable planetary reflex motion. Methods: Based on an analytical description of the astrometric signal amplitude, we place the expected signatures of putative moons around real exoplanets into context with our current and future astrometric measurement precision. Modelling the orbital perturbation as a function of time, we then simulate the detection process to obtain the first astrometric exomoon sensitivity curves. Results: The astrometric technique already allows for the detection and characterisation of favourable moons around giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs. On the basis of 12 epochs obtained with VLTI/GRAVITY, it is already today possible to infer the presence of a 0.14 $\\mathrm{M}_\\mathrm{Jup}$ satellite at a separation of 0.39 AU around AF Lep b. Future facilities offering better precision will refine our sensitivity in both moon mass and separation from the host planet by several orders of magnitude. Conclusions: The astrometric method of exomoon detection provides a promising avenue towards making the detection of these elusive worlds a reality and efficiently building a sample of confirmed objects. With a future facility that achieves an astrometric precision of 1 mas, probing for Earth-like moons within the habitable zone of a given star will become a realistic proposition.",

We confirm that there are two plasma components in both nebulae: a normal nebular plasma that emits both forbidden and permitted lines and an additional plasma component that emits the permitted lines of O I, C II, N II, O II, and Ne II. These plasma components have different spatial distributions, with the additional plasma component being the more centrally concentrated. Their physical conditions are also different, with the additional plasma component being denser and cooler. We find that, in these objects, the additional plasma component contains masses of N$^{2}$ and O$^{2}$ ions that are at least as large as the normal nebular plasma.

        "abstract": "We present the first deep radio continuum observations of Pa 30, a nebula hosting a unique optical source driven by an ultrafast outflow with a velocity of 16,000 km s$^{-1}$. The nebula was proposed to be the remnant of a white dwarf merger that occurred in 1181CE. We report no detection of the radio diffuse emission from Pa 30 or radio emission from the central source, setting $3\\sigma$ upper limit flux densities of $0.84\\,\\rm mJy$ and $0.29\\,\\rm mJy$ at 1.5 GHz and 6 GHz, respectively, for Pa 30. The radio surface brightness of Pa 30 is $\\sim 3$ orders of magnitude smaller than that of typical supernova remnants (SNRs) with comparable angular size. If Pa 30 is an SNR, our observations show it to be the faintest known in the radio band. Considering that 10\\% of the supernova (SN) kinetic energy is transferred to cosmic rays (CRs), the absence of radio synchrotron emission suggests that the SN kinetic energy $\\lesssim3\\times 10^{47}(B/10 \\mu\\rm G)^{-1.65}$ erg, which is 3 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of typical SNRs and the lowest measured among Galactic SNRs. There is also an indication of inefficient CR acceleration for this source. The low SN kinetic energy either implies the potential existence of many more radio-faint, sub-energetic SNRs in our Galaxy or challenges the SNR interpretation of Pa 30.",

        "abstract": "Here we investigate an infrared eruptive source, identified from the decade-long VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea survey (VVV). We named this target after a group of variable sources discovered by VVV, as VVV-WIT-13, with WIT standing for \"What Is This?\", due to its unique photometric variation behaviour and the mysterious origin of the outburst. This target exhibited an outburst with a 5.7 mag amplitude in the Ks-band, remained on its brightness plateau for 3.5 years, and then rapidly faded to its pre-eruptive brightness afterwards. We aim to reveal the variable nature and outburst origin of VVV-WIT-13 by presenting our follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations along with theoretical models. We gathered photometric time series in both near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. We obtained near-infrared spectra during the outburst and decaying stages on XSHOOTER/VLT and FIRE/Magellan, and then fitted the detected molecular absorption features using models from ExoMol. We applied 2D numerical simulations to re-create the observables of the eruptive phenomenon. We observe deep AlO absorption bands in the infrared spectra of VVV-WIT-13, during the outburst stage, along with other more common absorption bands (e.g. CO). Our best-fit model suggests a 600 K temperature of the AlO absorption band. In the decaying stage, the AlO bands disappeared, whilst broad blue-shifted H2 lines arose, a common indicator of stellar wind and outflow. The observational evidence suggests that the CO and TiO features originate from an outflow or a wind environment. We find that VVV-WIT-13 is an eruptive young star with instability occurring in the accretion disk. One favoured theoretical explanation of this event is a disrupted gas clump at a distance of 3 au from the source. If confirmed, this would be the first such event observed in real time.",

        "abstract": "The study of the chemical composition of star-forming regions is key to understand the chemical ingredients available during the formation of planetary systems. Given that the chemical inventory on interstellar dust grains in the prestellar phases might be altered due to the prostostellar warm-up, an alternative to infer the chemical composition on the grains could be to observe regions affected by shocks associated with molecular outflows. Such shocks can desorb the molecules, and might produce less chemical processing due to shorter timescales. We present here a detailed study of the chemical reservoir of a shocked region located in the G31.41+0.31 protocluster using GUAPOS data (G31.41+0.31 Unbiased ALMA sPectral Observational Survey). We report here the detection of 30 molecular species (plus 18 isotopologues). We performed a comparison of the molecular ratios in the shocked region with those derived towards the hot core of G31.41+0.31, finding that they are poorly correlated, excepting N-bearing species. Our results confirm observationally that a different level of chemical alteration is present in hot cores and in shocks. While the former likely alter the molecular ratios due to thermal processing during longer timescales, the latter might represent freshly desorbed material that constitutes a better proxy of the icy mantle composition. The similarity of molecular ratios between the N-bearing species in the G31.41 shock and the hot core suggests that these species are desorbed at early evolutionary stages. Interestingly, we have found that the abundances in the G31.41 shock show better correlations with other shock-dominated regions (two protostellar outflows and a Galactic Center molecular cloud). This suggests a negligible gas-phase chemistry after shock-induced ejection from grains, and that the ice-mantle composition is similar regardless of the Galactic environment.",

Using radio polarimetric techniques, we probe the dynamics and magnetic (B-) field geometry of outflows in Seyfert and LINER galaxies. Multi-band data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) reveal how low-power jets interact with their environment. These interactions can slow down and disrupt the radio outflows while locally regulating star formation through AGN feedback. Several radio properties correlate strongly with the black hole mass, similar to trends observed in radio-loud (RL) AGN. Although their characteristics differ, RQ systems might not be intrinsically distinct from RL AGN, apart from lower jet powers. Our polarization measurements further suggest a composite model in which a black hole-accretion disk system drives both a collimated jet with a small-pitch-angle helical B-field and a wide-angle wind threaded by a high-pitch-angle helical field.",

We validate our measurements using two different sets of mocks, a series of data splits, and a large set of analysis variations, which were first performed blinded. Our analysis constrains the ratio $D_M/D_H(z_\\mathrm{eff})=4.525\\pm0.071$, where $D_H=c/H(z)$ is the Hubble distance, $D_M$ is the transverse comoving distance, and the effective redshift is $z_\\mathrm{eff}=2.33$. This is a factor of $2.4$ tighter than the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) constraint from the same data. When combining with Ly$\\alpha$ BAO constraints from DESI DR2, we obtain the ratios $D_H(z_\\mathrm{eff})/r_d=8.646\\pm0.077$ and $D_M(z_\\mathrm{eff})/r_d=38.90\\pm0.38$, where $r_d$ is the sound horizon at the drag epoch.

Periodic boundaries reduce wall artifacts yet cannot realize finite net vorticity because of topological obstruction, so bulk simulations with non-zero circulation are typically unavailable. Hence, we impose quasi-periodic boundary conditions that keep the superfluid's density periodic while enforcing phase windings consistent with a net prescribed total vorticity. This setting conserves the net number of vortices and enables long-time tracking of vortex trajectories in settings that finite containers cannot capture. This allows us to study vortex depinning and nucleation leading to the creation of K\\'arm\\'an vortex streets and the creation of perfectly periodic vortex arrays.

A one-day flight over Australia resulted in a significant gamma-ray detection in the light curve and revealed a $7.9\\sigma$ excess in the image map from the Galactic center region. These results, obtained through a simple and unambiguous analysis, demonstrate the high reliability and sensitivity of the ETCC and establish its potential for future high-precision MeV gamma-ray observations. The measured intensity and spatial distribution were tested against three emission models: a single point-like source, a multi-component structure, and a symmetric two-dimensional Gaussian. All models were found to be statistically consistent with the data. The positronium-related flux in the multi-component model is $(3.2~\\pm~1.4)~\\times~10^{-2}$ photons cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, which is approximately a factor of two higher than the value reported by INTEGRAL, with a discrepancy at the $2\\sigma$ level. This difference may arise from unresolved sources or truly diffuse emission, such as exotic processes involving light dark matter or primordial black holes.",

By using the result of our previous study which showed that the massive disk is unstable to the non-axisymmetric deformation, we predict the amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves and show that the collapse of rotating very massive stellar cores can be a promising source of gravitational waves for Einstein Telescope.

        "abstract": "With the release of the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA gravitational-wave catalog (GWTC-4), we are starting to gain a detailed view of the population of merging binary black holes. The formation channels of these black holes is not clearly understood, but different formation mechanisms may lead to subpopulations with different properties visible in gravitational-wave data. Adopting a phenomenological approach, we find GWTC-4 data supports the presence of at least three subpopulations, each associated with a different range of black hole mass and with sharp transition boundaries between them. Each subpopulation is characterized by different distributions for either the mass ratios, the black-hole spin magnitudes or both. Subpopulation A with primary mass $m_1 \\leq 27.7^{+4.1}_{-3.4} M_{\\odot}$ ($90 \\%$ credibility), is characterized by a nearly flat mass ratio distribution $q=m_2/m_1$, and by small spin magnitudes ($\\chi \\leq 0.5^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$). Subpopulation B with $27.7^{+4.1}_{-3.4} M_{\\odot} \\leq m_1 \\leq 40.2^{+4.7}_{-3.2} M_{\\odot}$, has a much sharper preference for mass ratio $q \\approx 1$. Subpopulation C, with $m_1 \\geq 40.2^{+4.7}_{-3.2} M_{\\odot}$, has support for large spin magnitudes, and tentative support for mass ratios $q\\approx0.5$. We interpret these transitions as evidence for multiple subpopulations, each potentially associated with a different formation pathways. We suggest potential formation scenarios for each subpopulations, and suggest that Subpopulation B may be associated with chemically homogeneous evolution or population III stars. Our findings for Subpopulation C are largely consistent with recent claims of hierarchical mergers, but with some curious differences in properties.",

In this analysis, the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, is treated as a free parameter, avoiding assumptions about early-Universe physics. By combining uncalibrated comoving distances from BAO and supernovae with constraints on the matter density $\\Omega_m h^2$ from CMB and galaxy lensing/clustering, we break the $r_d$-$H_0$ degeneracy and obtain $H_0 = 70.0 \\pm 1.7$ km/s/Mpc when the sum of the neutrino masses is fixed at $\\Sigma m_\\nu = 0.06$ eV. With a conservative prior on the amplitude of primordial fluctuations, $A_s$, we find $H_0 = 70.03 \\pm 0.97$ km/s/Mpc and $r_d = 144.8 \\pm 1.6$ Mpc.

In this work, we present the first non-linear numerical simulation of spherically symmetric neutron stars using the BDNK formulation under the Cowling approximation. Using a simplified equation of state, we show that stable evolutions can be constructed within a restricted parameter space up to the simulation time we explored. From these simulations, we analyse the frequency content of the quasi-normal modes and the decay rate of the fundamental mode.

However, recent observations of GRB~211211A and GRB~230307A, both arising from compact star mergers, challenge this model due to their minute-long durations. The data from both events are consistent with having a nascent, rapidly spinning highly magnetized neutron star (a millisecond magnetar) as the merger product and GRB engine, but a smoking gun signature is still missing. Here we report strong but not yet conclusive evidence for the detection of a 909-Hz gamma-ray periodic signal during a brief time window of GRB~230307A, which is consistent with the rotation frequency of such a millisecond magnetar. Notably, the periodic signal appeared for only 160~ms at an epoch coinciding with the transition epoch when the jet emission from the GRB central engine ceased and when the delayed emission from high latitudes started. If this signal is real, the temporal and spectral features of this gamma-ray periodicity can be consistently interpreted as asymmetric mini-jet emission from a dissipating Poynting-flux-dominated jet, as revealed by the energy-dependent light curve data of this burst.",

Exploring the properties and origin of this gas could be fundamental to better understanding the transition between the protoplanetary and debris disk phases, the evolution of icy planetesimal belts, and the formation of planetary atmospheres. To expand the list of known CO-bearing debris disks and to improve our knowledge of the environmental conditions under which they can form, we targeted twelve dust-rich debris disks around young ($10^{-3}$ M$_\\oplus$. By combining our results with those of other studies we concluded, in agreement with previous findings, that the detection rate of CO gas is significantly higher for disks around stars with $6.5~L_\\odot<21.9~L_\\odot$ ($\\sim$A8$-$A0 spectral type) than for disks around less luminous stars ($0.18~L_\\odot<6.4~L_\\odot$, K7$-$A9). A comparison of the measured CO masses and the estimated mass loss rates of solids in disks with low CO content ($<$10$^{-4}$ M$_\\oplus$) suggests that collisions may play a role in CO gas production in such systems. Interestingly, however, the estimated mass loss rates of CO-rich debris disks are not higher than those of systems with low CO content. In light of this finding, we speculate on what could lead to the formation of CO-rich debris disks.",

Depending on the symmetry breaking scale associated with the strings, the latter could be a source of observable gravitational waves, intermediate scale dark matter, and the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis. Topologically stable superconducting strings also appear if the $E_6$ symmetry breaking leaves unbroken the $Z_2$ subgroup of $Z_4$, the center of $SO(10)$. The zero modes of the SM fermions are the charge carriers in this case. Finally, the flux matching condition ensures that the Aharanov-Bohm phase change in going around the metastable strings is an integer multiple of $2 \\pi$ for all fields.

        "abstract": "Recent BAO measurements from DESI, when combined with CMB and supernovae data, suggest evolving dark energy and in particular point to a possible phantom regime, with an equation of state parameter $w<-1$.   We explore an alternative phenomenological way to model dark matter and dark energy based on a unified dark fluid (UDF). By construction, our model reproduces the same background expansion history as DESI's best-fit using the CPL parametrization, but assumes a vanishing rest-frame sound speed and no anisotropic stress. This simple prescription ensures a consistent and physical treatment of perturbations, and the use of a unified dark sector avoids phantom behaviour by construction. We model CMB, LSS, and redshift-space distortion observables, and find differences with CPL that are typically at the few-percent level. As a result, we forecast that even stage IV CMB and galaxy surveys will have limited power to discriminate between our UDF and CPL at the linear level. At the non-linear level, we study spherical collapse in the UDF and show that within this framework, structure formation proceeds very similarly to standard scenarios.   Using Planck, DESI BAO DR2, and DESY5 supernovae data, we demonstrate that this simple UDF model fits current observations nearly as well as CPL, while treating perturbations consistently. Because most cosmological observations are not sensitive to how the dark sector is split, the unified framework can also approximate the phenomenology of interacting dark energy-dark matter scenarios or evolving dark matter, making it a general way to model the data, at least as long as the dark components have a vanishing sound speed, which is the most distinctive feature of our analysis. This highlights that a unified dark fluid with evolving equation of state and null sound speed is sufficient to pass current constraints without a phantom component.",

We detected X-ray pulsations at a frequency of around 245 Hz. The long-term evolution of the neutron star ephemerides suggests a spin-down derivative of about -2.3e-15 Hz/s, compatible with a rotation-powered phase while in quiescence. Moreover, the evolution of the orbital period and the time of the ascending node suggests a fast orbital shrinkage, which challenges the standard evolution scenario for this class of pulsars involving angular momentum loss via gravitational wave emission. The spectral analysis revealed a dominant power-law-like Comptonisation component, along with a thermal blackbody component, consistent with a hard state. Weak broad emission residuals around 6.6 keV suggest the presence of a K-alpha transition of neutral or He-like Fe originating from the inner region of the accretion disc. Self-consistent reflection models confirmed a moderate ionisation of the disc truncated at around (82-370) km from the neutron star. Finally, the study of the type-I X-ray burst revealed no signature of photospheric radius expansion. We found marginally significant burst oscillations during the rise and decay of the event, consistent with the neutron star spin frequency.",

Constraints on its strength $B$ can be derived from its influence on time-delayed very-high-energy photons from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in the electromagnetic cascades along their path to the Earth. The present lower limit achieved on its intensity is $10^{-18}\\;\\mathrm{G}$. In this work, we simulate data from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), accounting for realistic observational constraints, and we apply a joint spectral and temporal fit to characterize the IGMF. GRBs 190114C and 221009A are used as test cases to assess the sensitivity of CTAO. They demonstrate that a broad range of IGMF strengths can be probed with a lower bound as high as $10^{-15}\\;\\mathrm{G}$. Notably, we show that observations by the CTAO first large telescope, LST-1, already allow us to exclude field strengths up to $3\\times 10^{-17}\\;\\mathrm{G}$.",

        "abstract": "Antikaon ($K^-$) condensation within neutron star matter (NS) depends on the antikaon-nucleon interaction potential ($U_K$). Appearance of $K^-$ generally softens the equation of state (EOS). The impact of this softening on the structure of the NS can be leveraged to find a telltale sign of the phase transition from nucleonic matter to $K^-$ condensation. To investigate the impact of $K^-$ condensation on NS properties using a Bayesian inference framework, we choose two sets of RMF model parameters to obtain a stiff (DD2) and relatively soft (FSU) nucleonic EOS, and explore a wide range of optical potential depths. Multimessenger observations from NICER and LIGO/Virgo constrain the optical potential values to $U_K = -104.72^{+13.82}_{-12.48}$ MeV and $U_K = -66.46^{+2.47}_{-3.42}$ MeV for the stiff and soft cases, respectively. Deeper $K^-$ potentials trigger condensation at a lower density, softening the EOS and lowering the corresponding maximum masses. While slopes of mass-radius and tidal deformability curves overlap between nucleonic and exotic EOSs, their curvature and $f-$mode oscillation properties (frequency and damping time) reveal features attributable to EOS softening. However, distinguishing the specific exotic degrees of freedom responsible for the softening remains an open challenge.",

While extensively researched theoretically, speedmeters are yet to be demonstrated with a moving test mass in an optomechanical setting. In this work, we present the first experimental observation of speedmeter behavior in a system with a movable test mass. We realize a novel hybrid readout cavity configuration that enables simultaneous extraction of position and speed signals from two distinct output ports. We compare the optical transfer functions associated with each channel and observe the expected scaling behavior that distinguishes a speedmeter from a position-meter. We support our observations with a detailed theoretical model, showing how the hybrid readout cavity implements key speedmeter features.

        "abstract": "The distribution of close-in exoplanets is shaped by the interplay between atmospheric and dynamical processes. The Neptunian Desert, Ridge, and Savanna illustrate the sensitivity of these worlds to such processes, making them ideal to disentangle their roles. Determining how many Neptunes were brought close-in by early disk-driven migration (DDM; maintaining primordial spin-orbit alignment) or late high-eccentricity migration (HEM; generating large misalignments) is essential to understand how much atmosphere they lost. We propose a unified view of the Neptunian landscape to guide its exploration, speculating that the Ridge is a hot spot for evolutionary processes. Low-density Neptunes would mainly undergo DDM, getting fully eroded at shorter periods than the Ridge, while denser Neptunes would be brought to the Ridge and Desert by HEM. We embark on this exploration via ATREIDES, which relies on spectroscopy and photometry of 60 close-in Neptunes, their reduction with robust pipelines, and their interpretation through internal structure, atmospheric, and evolutionary models. We carried out a systematic RM census with VLT/ESPRESSO to measure the distribution of 3D spin-orbit angles, correlate its shape with system properties and thus relate the fraction of aligned-misaligned systems to DDM, HEM, and atmospheric erosion. Our first target, TOI-421c, lies in the Savanna with a neighboring sub-Neptune TOI-421b. We measured their 3D spin-orbit angles (Psib = 57+11-15 deg; Psic = 44.9+4.4-4.1 deg). Together with the eccentricity and possibly large mutual inclination of their orbits, this hints at a chaotic dynamical origin that could result from DDM followed by HEM. ATREIDES will provide the community with a wealth of constraints for formation and evolution models. We welcome collaborations that will contribute to pushing our understanding of the Neptunian landscape forward.",

PNe exhibit diverse morphologies, the origins of which are not fully understood. PNe with OH (OHPNe) and H$_{2}$O (H$_{2}$OPNe) masers are thought to be nascent PNe. However, the number of known OHPNe and H$_{2}$OPNe remains small, and only in eight cases the position of the maser emission has been found to coincide with the PN, using the high astrometric accuracy of interferometric observations. In order to identify more OHPNe and H$_{2}$OPNe, we used public databases and our own ATCA/VLA observations to match the positions of OH and H$_{2}$O masers with known PNe and radio continuum emitters, considering radio continuum emission as a possible tracer of the photoionized gas that characterizes PNe. Here we report the confirmation of positional coincidence of maser emission with one more PN, and 12 PN candidates. Moreover, we have confirmed three evolved stars as `water fountains' (WFs) hosting H$_2$O masers. These WFs are associated with radio continuum emission, but their possible nature as PNe has not yet been confirmed. Although a final characterization of maser-emitting PNe as a group still requires confirmation of more objects, their distribution in the infrared color-color diagrams suggests that they are a heterogeneous group of PNe. In particular, the new OHPN IRAS 07027$-$7934 has been reported to contain a late [WC]-type central star, while the maser emission implies an O-rich envelope. This property is found in only one other known maser-emitting PN, although we found evidence that other confirmed and candidate OHPNe may also have mixed chemistry, since they show emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The new WF IRAS 18443$-$0231 shows radio continuum that is dominated by strong and variable non-thermal emission, as in magnetized outflows.",

The soft spectral index of these neutrinos has previously been interpreted as an indication that this source accelerates protons only up to energies of several hundred TeV. Here, we propose that this source might instead accelerate protons to significantly higher energies, but that the charged pions and muons produced in their interactions undergo significant synchrotron energy losses before they can decay, leading to a cutoff in the neutrino spectrum at TeV-scale energies. This scenario would require very strong magnetic fields to be present in the acceleration region of NGC 1068, on the order of $B \\sim 10^7 \\, {\\rm G}$. We point out that this synchrotron cooling would impact the flavor ratios of the neutrinos from this source, providing a means to test this scenario with future very-large volume neutrino telescopes.",

In this contribution, we validate the radio module by comparing air-shower simulations in CORSIKA 8, CORSIKA 7, and ZHAireS. We investigate the impact of simulation parameters, such as the step size of particle tracks, on the resulting radio signals and perform a detailed comparison of the ``Endpoints'' and ``ZHS'' formalisms. For the same underlying showers simulated with CORSIKA 8 with optimized step sizes, both formalisms converge to the same radiation energy within 2%. For CORSIKA 8 and CORSIKA 7, agreement on the radiation energy is better than 10% in the 30-80 MHz band and improves to better than 2% for 50-350 MHz. This consistency provides further confirmation of the accuracy of microscopic air-shower radio emission simulations which is crucial for precise energy scale estimations using radio detection.",

        "abstract": "Gravitational microlensing is a unique method for discovering cold planets across a broad mass range. Reliable statistics of the microlensing planets require accurate sensitivity estimates. However, the impact of the degeneracies in binary-lens single-source (2L1S) models that affect many actual planet detections is often omitted in sensitivity estimates, leading to potential self-inconsistency of the statistics studies. In this work, we evaluate the effect of the 2L1S degeneracies on planetary sensitivity by simulating a series of typical microlensing events and comprehensively replicating a realistic planet detection pipeline, including the anomaly identification, global 2L1S model search, and degenerate model comparison. We find that for a pure-survey statistical sample, the 2L1S degeneracies reduce the overall planetary sensitivity by $5\\sim10\\%$, with the effect increasing at higher planet-host mass ratios. This bias leads to an underestimation of planet occurrence rates and a flattening of the inferred mass-ratio function slope. This effect will be critical for upcoming space-based microlensing surveys like the Roman or Earth 2.0 missions, which are expected to discover $\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ planets. We also discuss the computational challenges and propose potential approaches for future applications.",

In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that the Australian-built Veloce spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope can resolve atmospheric signatures from transiting exoplanets. We observed a single transit of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-189b - a favourable target given its extreme irradiation and bright host star - and applied the cross-correlation technique using standardised templates. We robustly detect ionised calcium (Ca+), and find evidence for hydrogen (H), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), neutral calcium (Ca), titanium (Ti), ionised titanium (Ti+), ionised iron (Fe+), neutral iron (Fe), and ionised strontium (Sr+). The strongest detection was achieved in the red arm of Veloce, consistent with expectations due to the prominent Ca+ triplet at wavelengths around 850-870 nm. Our results validate Veloce's capability for high-resolution atmospheric studies, highlighting it as an accessible, flexible facility to complement larger international telescopes. If future observations stack multiple transits, Veloce has the potential to reveal atmospheric variability, phase-dependent spectral changes, and detailed chemical compositions of highly irradiated exoplanets.",

This hybrid design provides both excellent sensitivity and a sub-degree pointing resolution.

These simulations were used to discover the array layout which provides maximum sensitivity at 100 PeV, as well to select the optimal antenna design. Additionally, the event reconstruction accuracy has been tested for various designs of the sparse array via simulated interferometry.

        "abstract": "The Weyl geometric gravity theory, in which the gravitational action is constructed from the square of the Weyl curvature scalar and the strength of the Weyl vector, has been intensively investigated recently. The theory admits a scalar-vector-tensor representation, obtained by introducing an auxiliary scalar field, and can therefore be reformulated as a scalar-vector-tensor theory in a Riemann space, in the presence of a nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field. By assuming that the Weyl vector has only a radial component, an exact spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the field equations can be obtained, which depends on three integration constants. As compared to the Schwarzschild solution, the Weyl geometric gravity solution contains two new terms, linear and quadratic in the radial coordinate, respectively. In the present work we consider the possibility of testing and obtaining observational restrictions on the Weyl geometric gravity black hole at the scale of the Solar System, by considering six classical tests of general relativity (gravitational redshift, the E\\\"{o}tv\\\"{o}s parameter and the universality of free fall, the Nortvedt effect, the planetary perihelion precession, the deflection of light by a compact object, and the radar echo delay effect, respectively) for the exact spherically symmetric black hole solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. All these gravitational effects can be fully explained and are consistent with the vacuum solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. Moreover, the study of the classical general relativistic tests also allows to constrain the free parameter of the solution.",

To answer this question we studied thermal evolution of newborn strange star taking into account thermal conductivity of free quarks and neutrino emission by the URCA process. Our results show that extremely high luminosity due to the Schwinger process and insufficient thermal conductivity of quarks leads to development of steep temperature gradient at the surface of strange star. As a result, the temperature at the surface and hence its luminosity decreases as a power law, reaching $10^{40}$ erg/s already at 10 ms. This result holds even in the presence of neutrinosphere.",

We confirm that all of these are consistent with persistent drift direction changes. These 'bi-drifting' pulsars present a challenge to the classical carousel model for sub-pulse drifting. In general, bi-drifting in this expanded sample is less clear than some of the previously published cases, which we attribute to narrower profile widths ($<20$ degrees) or smaller $P_3$ values (close to 2$P$). However, given the broad variety of pulse shapes and drift behaviours across the pulsar population, it is unsurprising that the phenomenon is not limited to only those where it can most easily be detected. Four of our samples show at least two emission modes with different profile shapes and drift properties, which seems to be a relatively common feature of bi-drifting pulsars. We also find jumps in sub-pulse phase between adjacent components in two pulsars. In addition to our MeerKAT L-band data, we used GMRT observations for four, and MeerKAT UHF observations for two of these pulsars to investigate the frequency dependence of sub-pulse drift. We find subtle changes in the drift as a function of frequency, but no clear overall pattern. Looking at the distribution of bi-drifting pulsars over $P$, $\\dot{P}$ and $P_3$ suggests they are consistent with the underlying population of all drifting pulsars.",

This is because of the competition between decay and interaction of the parent mesons, which depends on the atmospheric density. As a result, the number of muons at ground shows a seasonal variation, with the strength of the variation depending on the primary cosmic-ray energy, mass, as well as the energy of the detected muons. In this contribution, we study the variations of the muon energy spectrum in air showers using MCEq, a numerical solver of the cascade equations. In particular, we show how the amplitude of the seasonal variations of the number of high-energy (O(TeV)) muons in the shower depends on the primary energy, mass, as well as the assumed hadronic interaction model. A measurement of these variations is possible with the combination of a surface air-shower array and a deep underground detector, which provide a simultaneous measurement of the primary energy and the high-energy muon multiplicity, and may provide a new way to probe the cosmic-ray mass composition and hadronic interactions.",

        "abstract": "The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) represents the next-generation gamma-ray observatory and will operate for several decades. It will be particularly suited to analyse transients and variable phenomena, which will trigger real-time scientific alerts. To support this, the Science Alert Generation (SAG) pipeline within the Array Control and Data Acquisition (ACADA) system will process data from telescope arrays in real time, using dedicated pipelines for data reconstruction (SAG-RECO), data quality monitoring (SAG-DQ) and science monitoring (SAG-SCI). The Supervisor (SAG-SUP) oversees the dynamic operations of SAG and its integration with other ACADA components. SAG is designed to issue candidate science alerts within 20 s of data availability, processing events on multiple time scales (seconds to hours) and handling trigger rates of tens of kHz. Meeting these requirements necessitates optimised software and hardware architectures. This work presents recent developments in SAG's architecture, aimed at two main challenges: (1) selecting data only from telescopes that have entered a stable tracking state, even when they begin tracking at different times during multi-telescope observations, and (2) incorporating environmental and system monitoring information to ensure high data quality. SAG-SUP can retrieve real-time telescope status and environmental conditions from telescope managers and the weather station through the ACADA Monitoring system, collect them in a database and then use them to filter out data from slewing phases or degraded conditions. These enhancements are crucial to ensure the reliability of science alerts and improve the overall performance and responsiveness of the CTAO real-time analysis framework.",

        "abstract": "Many questions must be answered before understanding the relationship between the emerging magnetic flux through the solar surface and the extreme geoeffective events. The main ingredients for getting X-ray class flares and large interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are the build-up of electric current in the corona, the existence of magnetic free energy, magnetic energy/helicity ratio, twist, and magnetic stress in active regions (ARs). The upper limit of solar energy in the space research era, as well as the potential for experiencing superflares and extreme solar events, can be predicted using MHD simulations of CMEs.   To address this problem, we consider the recent events of May 2024 and use three MHD models: 1) OHM (\"Observationally driven High order scheme Magnetohydrodynamic code\") for investigating the magnetic evolutions at a synthetic dipole structure. 2) TMF (time-dependent magneto-friction) for setting up an initial non-potential magnetic field in the active region. A zero-beta MHD model for tracing the magnetic evolution of active regions. 3) EUHFORIA (''European heliospheric forecasting information asset'') for interplanetary CME propagations.   For the eruptive flares with CMEs, magnetic solar energy is computed along with data-constrained MHD simulations for the May 2024 events. We show the consistency between the data-initiated realistic simulation of the May 2024 big event and energy scalings from an idealised simulation of a bipolar eruption using OHM. The estimated free magnetic energy did not surpass $5.2 \\times 10^{32}\\;$erg. Good arrival time predictions ($<3$ hours) are achieved with the EUHFORIA simulation with the cone model. We note the interest in coupling all the chains of codes from the Sun to the Earth and developing different approaches to test the results.",

        "title": "A high geometric albedo and small size of the Haumea cluster member (24835) 1995 SM55 from a stellar occultation and photometric observations",
        "abstract": "Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are among the most ancient bodies of the solar system. Understanding their physical properties is key to constraining their origin and the evolution of the outer regions beyond Neptune. Stellar occultations provide highly accurate size and shape information. (24835) 1995 SM55 is one of the few members of the Haumea cluster and thus of particular interest. We aimed to determine its projected size, absolute magnitude, and geometric albedo, and to compare these with Haumea. A stellar occultation on 25 February 2024 was observed from five sites, with seven positive detections and 33 negative chords. An elliptical fit to the occultation chords yields semi-axes of $(104.3 \\pm 0.4) \\times (83.5 \\pm 0.5)$ km, giving an area-equivalent diameter of $186.7 \\pm 1.8$ km, smaller than the 250 km upper limit from Herschel thermal data. Photometry provides an absolute magnitude $H_V = 4.55 \\pm 0.03$, a phase slope of $0.04 \\pm 0.02$ mag/deg, and a $V-R = 0.37 \\pm 0.05$. The rotational variability has an amplitude $\\Delta m = 0.05$ mag, but the period remains uncertain. Combining occultation and photometry, we derive a geometric albedo $p_V = 0.80 \\pm 0.04$, one of the highest values measured for a TNO. This value is slightly higher than that of Haumea, consistent with the interpretation that 1995 SM55 belongs to the Haumea cluster.",

The main feature of this system is to ensure a stable and constant photon flux over time with the characteristics of a signal produced by Cherenkov light when a high-energy gamma ray crosses the atmosphere. Test results that show the performance of the optical calibration system have been recently published. In this article, we present in detail the system used to monitor the photon flux.",

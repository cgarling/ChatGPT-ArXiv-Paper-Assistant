        "abstract": "We present a model-independent null test of the late-time cosmological response to a reduced sound horizon, as typically required by early-universe solutions to the Hubble tension. In this approach, we phenomenologically impose a shorter sound horizon without modeling early-universe physics to isolate its impact on late-time dark energy inference. Using baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), supernovae (SN), big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), and local $H_0$ data, while explicitly avoiding CMB anisotropies, we examine how this calibration shift propagates into constraints on the dark energy equation of state. We find that lowering $r_d$ systematically drives the $w_0$-$w_a$ posterior toward less dynamical, quintessence-like behavior, bringing it closer to $\\Lambda$CDM. This result underscores that some of the apparent evidence for evolving or phantom-like dark energy may reflect early-universe assumptions rather than genuine late-time dynamics. More broadly, our analysis highlights the importance of carefully disentangling calibration effects from physical evolution in interpreting forthcoming results from DESI and future surveys.",

        "abstract": "The properties of Milky Way satellite galaxies have important implications for galaxy formation, reionization, and the fundamental physics of dark matter. However, the population of Milky Way satellites includes the faintest known galaxies, and current observations are incomplete. To understand the impact of observational selection effects on the known satellite population, we perform rigorous, quantitative estimates of the Milky Way satellite galaxy detection efficiency in three wide-field survey datasets: the Dark Energy Survey Year 6, the DECam Local Volume Exploration Data Release 3, and the Pan-STARRS1 Data Release 1. Together, these surveys cover $\\sim$13,600 deg$^2$ to $g \\sim 24.0$ and $\\sim$27,700 deg$^2$ to $g \\sim 22.5$, spanning $\\sim$91% of the high-Galactic-latitude sky ($|b| \\geq 15^\\circ$). We apply multiple detection algorithms over the combined footprint and recover 49 known satellites above a strict census detection threshold. To characterize the sensitivity of our census, we run our detection algorithms on a large set of simulated galaxies injected into the survey data, which allows us to develop models that predict the detectability of satellites as a function of their properties. We then fit an empirical model to our data and infer the luminosity function, radial distribution, and size-luminosity relation of Milky Way satellite galaxies. Our empirical model predicts a total of $265^{+79}_{-47}$ satellite galaxies with $-20 \\leq M_V \\leq 0$, half-light radii of $15 \\leq r_{1/2} (\\rm pc) \\leq 3000$, and galactocentric distances of $10 \\leq D_{\\rm GC} (\\rm kpc) \\leq 300$. We also identify a mild anisotropy in the angular distribution of the observed galaxies, at a significance of $\\sim$$2\\sigma$, which can be attributed to the clustering of satellites associated with the LMC.",

We follow the evolution of ultrathin stellar disks with varying dark matter (DM) halo concentration ($c$) using collisionless $N$-body simulations with \\texttt{AREPO}. We test models embedded in steep ($c = 12$), shallow ($c = 2$), and intermediate ($c = 6$) DM concentrations. Our models match the observed structural properties of the stellar disk in the low surface brightness (LSB) ultrathin galaxy FGC~2366, specifically its surface brightness, disk scalelength, and vertical thinness ($h_{z}/R_{D} = 0.1$), while excluding gas, allowing us to isolate the effects of DM. The internal disk heating mechanism driven by bars is suppressed in the LSB ultrathin stellar disks regardless of the DM concentration. The ratio of disk thickness ($h_z$) to scalelength ($R_D$) remains constant at $\\leq 0.1$ throughout their evolution. To clearly establish that the LSB nature of stellar disks is the key to preventing disk thickening, we construct the initial conditions by increasing the stellar mass fraction from $f_{s} \\sim 0.01$ to $0.02$ and $0.04$, respectively, while keeping the total mass equal to $10^{11} M_\\odot$ and $h_z/R_D \\leq 0.1$ unchanged. We find that models with a higher stellar mass fraction embedded in a shallow DM potential ($c = 2$) form bars and undergo significant disk thickening ($h_{z}/R_{D} \\gg 0.1$) concurrent with the bar growth. We conclude that if the LSB disks are thin to begin with, they remain so throughout their evolution in isolation, regardless of the concentration of the DM halo.",

With pySYD, a new open-source Python package, we were able to constrain the asteroseismic global parameters, $\\nu_{max}$ and $\\Delta\\nu$, for 82 solar-like oscillating subgiant and lower red giant stars, filling in the region between the Kepler dwarfs and giants.

Using 4 stellar modeling grids we determine and compare stellar ages for our sample. We find that our age distribution from stellar modeling is consistent with other local star samples. We find small consistent offsets from model predictions across our regime, but offsets were worse at higher gravities (log(g) $\\geq$ 3.5 dex), suggesting the need for better calibration. Finally, we discuss our sample in the context of galactic archaeology and show how ages like these could be used to identify and study binary system evolution and galactic evolution in the future.

        "abstract": "The role of interactions and mergers in the rapid quenching of massive galaxies in the early Universe remains uncertain, largely due to the difficulty of directly linking mergers to quenching. Collisional ring galaxies provide a unique opportunity, as their morphology allows precise dating of the interaction, which can then be compared to quenching timescales inferred from star formation histories. We study a gravitationally bound system at $z=1.61$ in the UDS field, composed of a Host galaxy ($M_\\star = 10^{11.4} M_\\odot$) with a collisional ring and an X-ray AGN, and the Bullet galaxy ($M_\\star = 10^{11.2} M_\\odot$), located at a projected distance of $\\sim 8$ kpc. Combining JWST and HST imaging with Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, we find compelling evidence for an ongoing starburst in the Host concurrent with rapid quenching in the Bullet. The ring, $\\sim 20$ kpc in diameter, is expanding at $127^{+72}_{-29}$ km s$^{-1}$, implying the galaxies first collided 47--96 Myr ago. This timeline is consistent with the Host's current starburst and the Bullet's sudden quenching, strongly suggesting both phenomena were triggered by the interaction. Crucially, the Bullet shows no evidence of a preceding starburst, ruling out rapid gas consumption as the primary quenching channel. Instead, we suggest that merger-driven processes -- such as enhanced turbulence and disk instabilities -- may have suppressed star formation. An additional possibility, which we term the ``Dragon Effect,'' is that AGN-driven outflows from the Host disrupted the Bullet's low-density molecular gas, thereby preventing efficient star formation and accelerating quenching.",

Here, we derive age and elemental abundance gradients for 8 distant ($1.2 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 2.2$), massive ($10.3\\lesssim\\log({\\rm M}_*/{\\rm M}_\\odot)\\lesssim 11.1$), quiescent galaxies, by fitting full-spectrum models to ultra-deep NIRSpec-MSA spectroscopy from the JWST-SUSPENSE survey. We find that these galaxies have negative age, positive [Mg/H] and [Mg/Fe], and flat [Fe/H] gradients, implying that galaxy cores are older and Mg-deficient compared to galaxy outskirts. The age gradients indicate inside-out quenching, while the Mg-deficient cores suggest rapid gas expulsion as the central quenching mechanism. Thus, galaxy cores formed faster and quenched more efficiently than their outskirts. In this scenario, however, our [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] gradients are still puzzling. Our results contrast lower-redshift studies, which find flat age and [Mg/Fe] gradients and negative metallicity gradients. Additionally, we find a positive trend between age gradients and rotational support, and marginal trends between gradients and galaxy velocity dispersions and ages. We discuss our findings in the context of galaxy growth scenarios, including minor mergers and progenitor bias, and the possible occurrence of different quenching mechanisms across redshift. With this work, we present the first stellar population gradients from NIRSpec-MSA spectroscopy, in the largest current sample of distant, quiescent galaxies.",

        "abstract": "Recent Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) results provided strong evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (sGWB), consistent with a population of merging massive black holes (MBHs) at $z5$ suggest a higher number density of accreting MBHs than previously estimated. Together with constraints from local MBHs and high-$z$ quasars, these findings offer a unique opportunity to test MBH seeding and early growth models. We explore this using ${\\tt L-Galaxies}\\textit{BH}$, a new extension of the galaxy formation model ${\\tt L-Galaxies}$, developed to explicitly model all stages of MBH evolution, including seeding, accretion, and binary dynamics. To take advantage of both the high resolution of the ${\\tt MillenniumII}$ and the large volume of the ${\\tt Millennium}$ simulations, we run ${\\tt L-Galaxies}\\textit{BH}$ on the former and use its outputs as initial conditions for the latter, via our $\\textit{grafting}$ method. We find that reproducing the number density of high-$z$ active MBHs observed by JWST requires either a heavy seed formation rate significantly higher than that predicted by current models ($\\gtrsim 0.01 Mpc^{-3}$ at $z \\sim 10$), or widespread formation of light seeds undergoing multiple phases of super-Eddington accretion. Furthermore, matching the amplitude of the PTA sGWB signal requires nearly all galaxies with stellar masses $M_{*}> 10^9 M_\\odot$ to host central MBHs by $z\\sim0$. Given the extreme heavy seed densities required to satisfy both PTA and JWST constraints, our results favor a scenario in which MBHs originate from light seeds that grow rapidly and efficiently in the early universe. This work demonstrates the power of combining multi-messenger data with physical models to probe the origins and evolution of MBHs across cosmic time.",

        "abstract": "Detecting parity violation on cosmological scales would provide a striking clue to new physics. Large-scale structure offers the raw statistical power -- many three-dimensional modes -- to make such tests. However, for scalar observables, like galaxy clustering, the leading parity-sensitive observable is the trispectrum, whose high dimensionality makes the measurement and noise estimation challenging. We present two late-time parity-odd kurto spectra that compress the parity-odd scalar trispectrum into one-dimensional, power-spectrum-like observables. They are built by correlating (i) two appropriately weighted quadratic composite fields, or (ii) a linear and cubic composite field, constructed from dark matter (DM) or galaxy overdensity fields. We develop an FFTLog pipeline for efficient theoretical predictions of the two observables. We then validate the estimators for a specific parity-odd primordial template on perturbative DM field, and on DM and halo fields in full N-body \\texttt{Quijote} simulations, with and without parity-odd initial conditions, in real and redshift space. For DM, the variance is dominated by the parity-even contribution -- i.e., the gravitationally induced parity-even trispectrum -- and is efficiently suppressed by phase-matched fiducial subtraction. For halos, discreteness-driven stochasticity dominates and is not appreciably reduced by subtraction; however, optimal weighting and halo-matter cross kurto spectra considerably mitigate this noise and enhance the signal. Using controlled down-sampling of the matter field, we empirically calibrate how the parity-even variance scales with number density and volume, and provide an illustrative forecast for the detectability of parity-odd kurto spectra in a Euclid-like spectroscopic galaxy survey.",

        "abstract": "Hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) span a range of hydrogen envelope masses at core collapse, producing diverse light curves from extended plateaus in Type II SNe to double-peaked Type IIb SNe. Recent hydrodynamic modeling predicts a continuous sequence of light-curve morphologies as hydrogen is removed, with short plateau SNe (plateau durations ~50--70 days) emerging as a transitional class. However, the observational boundary between IIb and short-plateau remains poorly defined, and thus far unobserved. We report on extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of SN 2023wdd and SN 2022acrv, candidate transitional events on the low-mass end of the short-plateau class. Both exhibit weak, double-peaked light curves which we interpret as exceptionally short plateaus (10--20 days), and hybrid spectral features: persistent H$\\alpha$ absorption with He I contamination, but without the helium dominance characteristic of IIb SNe. Using analytic shock-cooling models and numerical light curve fitting, we estimate hydrogen-rich envelope masses of ~0.6--0.8 $M_\\odot$ -- significantly larger than canonical IIb values ($\\lesssim0.1\\,M_\\odot$) but consistent with the ${\\sim}0.9\\,M_\\odot$ threshold predicted for short-plateau behavior. Although the progenitor radii inferred from analytic and numerical methods differ by factors of 2--5, envelope mass estimates are consistent across approaches. Comparisons to well-studied IIb (SN 2016gkg, SN 2022hnt), short-plateau (SN 2023ufx, SN 2006ai, SN 2016egz, SN 2006Y), and II SNe (SN 2023ixf, SN 2013ej) suggest a monotonic relationship between hydrogen envelope mass and plateau length consistent with analytic and numerical expectations. These findings provide additional evidence for a continuous distribution of envelope stripping in hydrogen-rich core-collapse progenitors and place SN 2023wdd and SN 2022acrv along the IIb/short-plateau boundary.",

In order to estimate the contributions of faint/low-mass sources we implement a method in which the faint-end of the IR LF is inferred by stacking (in stellar mass and redshift bins) the optical/near-infrared samples of star-forming galaxies into the appropriate FIR Herschel and sub-mm JCMT maps. Using this information we determine the faint-end slope of the FIR LF in two intermediate redshift bins (where it can be robustly established) and then adopt this result at all other redshifts. The evolution of the characteristic luminosity of the galaxy FIR LF, L*, is found to be increase monotonically with redshift, evolving as z^1.38+-0.07, while the characteristic number density is well fitted by double power-law function, constant at z4, and dust-obscured activity contributes <25% of SFRD by z~6.",

The gas released during these collisions can contribute to SMBH accretion, influencing phenomena such as active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events of the remnants. We address the challenge of rapidly and accurately predicting the outcomes of stellar collisionsincluding remnant masses and unbound gasacross a broad parameter space of initial conditions. Existing smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic (SPH) simulation techniques, while detailed, are too resource-intensive for exploratory studies or real-time applications. We develop a machine learning framework trained on a dataset of $\\sim 16,000$ SPH simulations of main-sequence star collisions. By extracting physically meaningful parameters (e.g., masses, radii, impact parameters, and virial ratios) and employing gradient-boosted regression trees with Huber loss, we create a model that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. The method includes logarithmic transforms to handle dynamic ranges and regularization to ensure physical plausibility. The model achieves predictions of collision outcomes (remnant masses, and unbound mass) with very low mean absolute errors respect to the typical mass scale. It operates in fractions of a second, enabling large-scale parameter studies and real-time applications. Parameter importance analysis reveals that the impact parameter and the relative velocity dominate outcomes, aligning with theoretical expectations. Our approach provides a scalable tool for studying stellar collisions in galactic nuclei.

Here we show that the presence of massive stars in close binaries is ubiquitous, even at low metallicity. Using the Very Large Telescope, we obtained multi-epoch radial velocity measurements of a representative sample of 139 massive O-type stars across the Small Magellanic Cloud, which has a metal content of about one fifth of the solar value. We find that 45% of them show radial velocity variations which demonstrate that they are members of close binary systems, and predominantly have orbital periods shorter than one year. Correcting for observational biases indicates that at least 70[+11:-6]% of the O stars in our sample are in close binaries, and that at least 68[+7:-8]% of all O stars interact with a companion star during their lifetime. We found no evidence supporting a statistically significant trend of the multiplicity properties with metallicity. Our results indicate that multiplicity and binary interactions govern the evolution of massive stars and determine their cosmic feedback and explosive fates.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies show that light seeds of black holes, which grow into massive black holes (MBHs) over time, often struggle to remain at the centers of their birthplaces in high-redshift galaxies, limiting their ability to accrete gas and merge with other black holes. In this work, we investigate how off-center formation of the first seeds affects the evolution of the MBH and massive black hole binary (MBHB) populations over cosmic history. To this end, we use the $\\texttt{L-Galaxies}{\\it BH}$ semi-analytical model, which includes multiple seed formation mechanisms, with light Population III remnants being the most significant contributors. To incorporate off-center formation, we modify the model to track the initial seed location, the sinking timescales toward the galactic center, and any growth during this phase. The results indicate that seed formation occurring away from the galactic center has a negligible impact on the MBH population at $z4$ can be up to 2-10 times smaller compared to a nuclear seed formation model. Quasar luminosity functions with $\\rm L_{bol}>10^{44} \\rm erg/s$ are similarly affected, although they still align with observational constraints. The off-centre formation also alters the galaxy-MBH mass relation. At $z>5$, the amplitude of the relation can be up to 2 dex smaller than in nuclear seed models. These differences fade by $z \\sim 2$ for galaxies $>10^{11} M_{\\odot}$, and by $z=0$ for smaller galaxies. Notably, the overmassive MBH population recently unveiled by JWST is still present in the model, suggesting they can form independently of the seed dynamics. Finally, the merging rate of MBHs within LISA sensitivity band is strongly impacted. Specifically, there is a suppression of events at high-$z$ and an enhancement at low-$z$.",

        "abstract": "MACS J0138-2155 is the only known cluster to strongly lens two supernovae (SNe), Requiem and Encore, from the same host galaxy at z=1.949. We present seven independent mass models of the galaxy cluster built using six software packages. By conducting a blind analysis (no exchanges of results between modeling teams), we quantified uncertainties due to modeling and software. Through HST, JWST and MUSE observations, we assembled high-quality data products, including eight \"gold\" lensed image systems consisting of 23 images with secure spectroscopic redshifts, and one \"silver\" system with a likely redshift value. Restricting to the gold images, we obtain overall consistent model predictions of the positions, magnifications and time delays of SN Encore and SN Requiem images, especially for models with $\\chi^2 \\leq 25$. We predict the appearance of the next images of SNe Encore and Requiem with a time delay of >~3000 days and of ~3700 to 4000 days, respectively, based on a fiducial cosmological model of $H_0 = 70 {\\rm\\ km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}}$ and $\\Omega_{\\rm m} = 0.3$. We obtain relations between $H_0$ and the time delays of SNe Encore and Requiem. In particular, for $H_0 = 73 {\\rm\\ km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}}$, the four lowest $\\chi^2$ models predict SN Requiem to reappear in ~Apr-Dec 2026; for $H_0 = 67 {\\rm\\ km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}}$, in ~Mar-Nov 2027. Using the newly measured time delay between the two detected images of SN Encore by Pierel et al. (submitted) and our mass models, we jointly infer $H_0 = {\\rm 66.9^{+11.2}_{-8.1}\\ km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}}$, where the uncertainty is dominated by that of the time delay. The long delays of the next-appearing SN Requiem and SN Encore images provide excellent opportunities to measure $H_0$ with an uncertainty of 2-3%. Our mass models form the basis for cosmological inference from this unique lens cluster with two strongly lensed SNe. (Abridged)",

        "abstract": "Multiply-imaged supernovae (SNe) provide a novel means of constraining the Hubble constant ($H_0$). Such measurements require a combination of precise models of the lensing mass distribution and an accurate estimate of the relative time delays between arrival of the multiple images. Only two multiply-imaged SNe, Refsdal and H0pe, have enabled measurements of $H_0$ thus far. Here we detail the third such measurement for SN Encore, a $z=1.95$ SNIa discovered in JWST/NIRCam imaging. We measure the time delay, perform simulations of additional microlensing and millilensing systematics, and combine with the mass models of Suyu et al. in a double-blind analysis to obtain our $H_0$ constraint. Our final time-delay measurement is $\\Delta t_{1b,1a}=-39.8_{-3.3}^{+3.9}$ days, which is combined with seven lens models weighted by the likelihood of the observed multiple image positions for a result of $H_0=66.9_{-8.1}^{+11.2} \\rm{km} \\rm{s}^{-1}\\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The uncertainty on this measurement could be improved significantly if template imaging is obtained. Remarkably, a sibling to SN Encore (SN \"Requiem\") was discovered in the same host galaxy, making the MACS J0138.0-2155 cluster the first system known to produce more than one observed multiply-imaged SN. SN Requiem has a fourth image that is expected to appear within a few years, providing an unprecedented decade-long baseline for time-delay cosmography and an opportunity for a high-precision joint estimate of $H_0$.",

Chemical modelling tools are essential for simulating the complex processes that govern molecular evolution. We present SIMBA, a new Python-based single-point astrochemical modelling package designed to solve chemical reaction networks across diverse astrophysical environments. The software follows standardised rate equation approaches to evolve molecular abundances under specified physical conditions, incorporating gas-phase chemistry, grain-surface processes, and photochemistry. While leveraging Python for accessibility, performance-critical routines utilise just-in-time compilation to achieve computational efficiency suitable for research applications. A key feature of SIMBA is its graphical interface, which enables rapid investigation of chemical evolution under varying physical conditions. This makes it particularly valuable for exploring parameter dependencies and complementing more computationally intensive multi-dimensional models. We demonstrate the package's capabilities by modelling chemical evolution in a photoevaporative flow driven by external FUV irradiation. Using simplified gas dynamics, we chain multiple SIMBA instances to create a dynamic 1D model where gas evolves both chemically and dynamically. Comparing this approach to typical static models - where chemistry in each grid cell evolves independently - reveals that molecular ices, especially those with relatively high binding energies like H2O, can survive much farther into the flow than static models predict. This example case highlights how SIMBA can be extended to higher dimensions for investigating complex chemical processes. The package is open-source and includes comprehensive documentation.",

In the case of silicon isotopes, two important indicators to establish the origin of presolar grains are the ratios 29Si/28Si and 30Si/28Si. To constrain theoretical predictions, the rates of key nuclear reactions influencing the abundances of 29Si and 30Si must be well known. One such reaction is 29Si(p,gamma)30P which plays a role in classical nova explosions. The aim of the present work is to determine the nonresonant cross section of the 29Si(p,gamma)30P reaction, which has not been previously measured. The activation method was employed to measure the total cross section at four proton energies between Ep = 1000 and 1430 keV. The measured cross sections were found to be significantly (a factor of 4.3+-0.6) higher than those predicted by theoretical direct capture calculations, thereby impacting the reaction rates at low astrophysical temperatures, below about 30 MK. This higher nonresonant cross section - now based on experimental data - can be used in forthcoming nucleosynthesis calculations of classical novae. As a secondary result, the 16O(p,gamma)17F cross section was also obtained and found to be in good agreement with existing literature data.",

All objects, observed in the 1.7-5.3 micron range, show strong hydrogen recombination lines in the Paschen, Brackett, Pfund, and Humphreys series, confirming their very young ages. The spectra of 11 YSOs show prominent absorption bands from the three most important ice species (H2O, CO2, CO), marking the first detection of these ices in intermediate-mass YSOs beyond our Galaxy. In three YSOs, water ice appears to be in crystalline form. In some objects, we also detect 13CO2 and OCS ices -- never before observed beyond the Milky Way (MW) -- and methanol ice in at least one star. We compared the column densities of H2O, CO2, and CO ices with those measured in more and less massive protostars in the MW and Large Magellanic Cloud, finding that in NGC 346 ice column densities reach values nearly an order of magnitude lower than in more massive objects (~1x10^{17} cm-2 for water and ~1x10^{16} cm-2 for CO2 and CO). However, the relative proportions of the ice species abundances do not differ from those in massive MW YSOs. This suggests that metallicity may not significantly affect ice chemistry in protoplanetary discs and that, shielded by the protostellar envelope or deep in the midplane, circumstellar material is likely impervious to the radiation environment.",

We investigate the dynamical and chemical implications of a 3D asymmetric radiation field that accounts for the optical properties of sub-structures present in a protoplanetary disk, as well as the inclusion of a secondary radiation source in binary systems. We conducted a series of 3D-SPH hydrodynamical simulations using PHANTOM, coupled with the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MCFOST, to compute disc temperatures on-the-fly. We explored different binary-disk orientations (0$^o$ and 30$^o$) for an eccentric binary, along with a constant dust-to-gas ratio and dust as a mixture prescription. We also simulated an outburst event as an example of a drastic increase in luminosity. Heating from the secondary star inflates the outer disk, increasing the aspect ratio facing the companion by about 25% in inclined cases compared to 10% in coplanar ones. Dust settling in the mid-plane enhances extinction along the disk plane, making the coplanar case cooler than the inclined one on the side of the disk facing the companion. Besides, heating causes a shift in the snow line for species with freeze-out temperatures below 50 K, depending on the disk-binary inclination and binary phase. During outbursts, the aspect ratio doubles on the star-facing side and increases by 50% on the opposite side in inclined cases. The snow line shift would impact all the species considered in the outburst case. Disk heating in binaries depends on stellar properties, orbital phase, and disk local and global characteristics. This results in temperature asymmetries, especially during secondary star outbursts, leading to variations in aspect ratio and snow lines that can affect chemistry and planet formation.",

Using direct N-body simulations with PETAR, we found that most micro-TDEs arise from few-body multiple encounters. The inferred rate is approximately 350-450 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Micro-TDEs could be detected both by upcoming surveys such as LSST, expected to observe roughly 10-100 events per year, and by their gravitational-wave (GW) signals peaking in the deci-Hertz band, detectable with future instruments such as LGWA and DECIGO.",

Our trained model predicts physical planet and disk parameters with $R^2 > 0.9$ from dust continuum images of PPDs. Applied to 23 real disks, VADER's mass estimates are consistent with literature values and reveal latent correlations that reflect known disk physics.

Chemistry in those dust/ice mixtures is determined by diffusion and reaction of molecules and radicals. However, investigations of diffusion of astrophysically relevant radicals and molecules across the surface and through the pores of cosmic dust grains and of surface reactions consequent to such diffusion is largely uncharted territory. This paper presents results of a study of a solid-state reaction of two molecular species, CO2 and NH3, separated by a layer of porous silicate grain aggregates, analogues of cosmic dust. The experiments demonstrate that the presence of the dust layer was necessary for a pure thermal CO2 + 2NH3 reaction to proceed, leading to the formation of ammonium carbamate (NH4+NH2COO-), an ionic solid containing a complex organic moiety of prebiotic interest recently detected in a protoplanetary disk. This result speaks for: (i) efficient diffusion of molecules on/within cosmic dust, (ii) an underestimated role for surface catalysis in the astrochemistry of cosmic dust, and (iii) potentially efficient dust-promoted chemistry in warm cosmic environments, such as protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks.",

This work explores the fine details of amorphous hydrocarbon nanoparticle, a-C(:H), composition and the evolution of the inherent sub-structures under extreme conditions, focusing on the characteristic CH$_n$ bands in the 3-4 micron wavelength region. Particular attention is paid to the role of dehydrogenation and its effects on the sp^3 and sp^2 hybridisations, leading to an extensive conjugated domain functionalisation of the contiguous structural network within a-C(:H) nanoparticles. Qualitatively this approach is able to explain the origin and evolution, including the appearance and disappearance, of emission bands observed in the 3-4 micron wavelength regime without a significant aromatic moiety content within the structures. A diatomic a-C(:H) phase is likely at the heart of the observed dust evolution in the interstellar medium, and circumstellar and photodissociation regions, as observed at short wavelengths. It appears that we have some way to go in fully understanding these complex materials. Much laboratory work will be required in order to elucidate their chemical and structural evolution at nanoparticle sizes under extreme conditions.",

While dark matter annihilation has long been considered a leading interpretation, an alternative scenario involving a large population of millisecond pulsars has not been ruled out. Testing this hypothesis with electromagnetic observations is difficult, as pulsar searches in the bulge are strongly affected by scattering, high sky temperature, and source confusion. We investigate whether gravitational-wave observations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could provide an independent probe of the millisecond pulsar binary population in the Galactic bulge.   We construct synthetic populations of millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries under two illustrative formation scenarios: an accreted scenario, in which systems are deposited by disrupted globular clusters, and an in situ scenario, in which binaries form through isolated binary evolution. In both cases, only $10^{-5}$--$10^{-4}$ of the underlying bulge population is detectable by LISA. Nevertheless, even a few detections would imply tens to hundreds of thousands of unseen systems. Accreted binaries are expected to have lower chirp masses ($\\sim$0.4 M$_\\odot$), while in situ binaries produce more massive companions ($\\sim$0.9 M$_\\odot$).   LISA will measure binary frequencies with high precision, but chirp masses can only be determined for the most massive or highest-frequency systems. Distinguishing millisecond pulsar binaries from the far more numerous double white dwarfs will be challenging, though LISA detections could provide valuable targets for follow-up with the Square Kilometre Array, enabling a critical test of the millisecond pulsar origin of the $\\gamma$-ray excess.",

        "abstract": "Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have been interpreted to suggest that dark energy may be evolving. In this work, we examine how prior choices affect such conclusions. Specifically, we study the biases introduced by the customary use of uniform priors on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters, $w_0$ and $w_a$, when assessing evidence for evolving dark energy. To do so, we construct theory-informed priors on $(w_0, w_a)$ using a normalizing flow (NF), trained on two representative quintessence models, which learns the distribution of these parameters conditional on the underlying $\\Lambda$CDM parameters. In the combined $\\textit{Planck}$ CMB + DESI BAO analysis we find that the apparent tension with a cosmological constant in the CPL framework can be reduced from $\\sim 3.1\\sigma$ to $\\sim 1.3\\sigma$ once theory-informed priors are applied, rendering the result effectively consistent with $\\Lambda$CDM. For completeness, we also analyze combinations that include Type Ia supernova data, showing similar shifts toward the $\\Lambda$CDM limit. Taken together, the observed sensitivity to prior choices in these analyses arises because uniform priors - often mischaracterized as \"uninformative\" - can actually bias inferences toward unphysical parameter regions. Consequently, our results underscore the importance of adopting physically motivated priors to ensure robust cosmological inferences, especially when evaluating new hypotheses with only marginal statistical support. Lastly, our NF-based framework achieves these results by post-processing existing MCMC chains, requiring $\\approx 1$ hour of additional CPU compute time on top of the base analysis - a dramatic speedup over direct model sampling that highlights the scalability of this approach for testing diverse theoretical models.",

Notably, the nulling strategy employed in amplitude interferometry, a configuration specifically proposed for exoplanet detection by leveraging destructive interference to suppress the brighter source, is quantum optimal for separation estimation. While intensity interferometry is less effective than amplitude interferometry in lossless scenarios and fails to achieve superresolution, it becomes competitive when optical loss in large-scale interferometry is considered. By applying these methodologies to modern stellar interferometry, we highlight the promise of large-scale interferometry for advancing high-resolution astronomical observation.",

Next, an automatic domain splitting (ADS) strategy is employed to generate subdomains, preserving HOTM accuracy, with an integrated feasibility estimation to reduce ADS's computation burden.Then, a two-stage HOTM-based polynomial optimization framework is introduced, first identifying combinable subdomain sequences and then refining the fixed point solutions. Finally, the method is applied to the Earth-Moon CRTBP, identifying POs up to nine revolutions in the planar case and four in the spatial case. Known families such as distant retrograde orbits (DROs) and Lyapunov orbits are recovered, along with a previously undocumented family that exhibits a hybrid character between DROs and Lyapunov orbits.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental and omnipresent energy conversion process in plasma physics. Novel observations of fields and particles from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have shown the absence of reconnection in a large number of current sheets in the near-Sun solar wind. Using near-Sun observations from PSP Encounters 4 to 11 (Jan 2020 to March 2022), we investigate whether reconnection onset might be suppressed by velocity shear. We compare estimates of the tearing mode growth rate in the presence of shear flow for time periods identified as containing reconnecting current sheets versus non-reconnecting times, finding systematically larger growth rates for reconnection periods. Upon examination of the parameters associated with reconnection onset, we find that 85% of the reconnection events are embedded in slow, non-Alfvenic wind streams. We compare with fast, slow non-Alfvenic, and slow Alfvenic streams, finding that the growth rate is suppressed in highly Alfvenic fast and slow wind and reconnection is not seen in these wind types, as would be expected from our theoretical expressions. These wind streams have strong Alfvenic} flow shear, consistent with the idea of reconnection suppression by such flows. This could help explain the frequent absence of reconnection events in the highly Alfvenic, near-Sun solar wind observed by PSP. Finally, we find a steepening of both the trace and magnitude magnetic field spectra within reconnection periods in comparison to ambient wind. We tie this to the dynamics of relatively balanced turbulence within these reconnection periods and the potential generation of compressible fluctuations.",

For the extragalactic component, in addition to the prompt and inverse Compton contributions, we also include cascade photons arising from inverse Compton scattering of pair-produced electrons and positrons. By combining all these contributions, we derive constraints on the dark matter parameter space. Our bounds for various two body Standard Model final states are strongest to date.

        "abstract": "Massive stars are often born in triples, where gravitational dynamics and stellar interactions play a crucial role in shaping their evolution. One such pathway includes the merger of the inner binary, transforming the system to a binary with a distinct formation history. Therefore, the interpretation of observed binary properties and their inferred formation history may require the consideration of a potential triple origin. We aim to investigate the population of stellar mergers in massive hierarchical triples. Specifically, we assess how frequently mergers occur, and characterise the properties of the post-merger binaries and their subsequent evolution. We combine the triple population synthesis code TRES, which self-consistently models stellar evolution, binary interaction, and gravitational dynamics, with the binary population synthesis code SeBa to simulate 10^5 dynamically stable, massive triples from the zero-age main sequence through merger and post-merger evolution. We explore the effects of a range of physical models for the initial stellar properties, mass transfer, and merger. We find that stellar mergers are a common outcome, occurring in 20-32% of massive triples. Most mergers happen relatively early in the evolution of the system and involve two main-sequence (MS) stars, producing rejuvenated merger remnants that can appear significantly younger than their tertiary companions. Consequently, we predict that 2-10% of all wide MS+MS binaries (P>100 days) have a measurable age discrepancy, and serve as a promising way to identify merged stars. The post-merger systems preferentially evolve into wide, eccentric binaries, with ~80% avoiding further interaction. However, a notable fraction (16-22%) undergoes a second mass-transfer phase, which may result in the formation of high-mass X-ray binaries or mergers of compact objects that spiral in via gravitational-wave emission.",

        "abstract": "The Vera C. Rubin Observatory LSST is expected to discover tens of millions of new Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The survey's exceptional cadence and sensitivity will enable UV/optical/NIR monitoring of a significant fraction of these objects. The unprecedented number of sources makes spectroscopic follow-up for the vast majority of them unfeasible in the near future, so most studies will have to rely on photometric redshifts estimates which are traditionally much less reliable for AGN than for inactive galaxies. This work presents a novel methodology to constrain the photometric redshift of AGNs that leverages the effects of cosmological time dilation, and of the luminosity and wavelength dependence of AGN variability. Specifically, we assume that the variability can be modeled as a damped random walk (DRW) process, and adopt a parametric model to characterize the DRW timescale ($\\tau$) and asymptotic amplitude of the variability (SF$_\\infty$) based on the redshift, the rest-frame wavelength, and the AGN luminosity. We construct variability-based photo-$z$ priors by modeling the observed variability using the expected DRW parameters at a given redshift. These variability-based photometric redshift (VAR-PZ) priors are then combined with traditional SED fitting to improve the redshift estimates from SED fitting.   Validation is performed using observational data from the SDSS, demonstrating significant reduction in catastrophic outliers by more than 10% in comparison with SED fitting techniques and improvements in redshift precision. The simulated light curves with both SDSS and LSST-like cadences and baselines confirm that, VAR-PZ will be able to constrain the photometric redshifts of SDSS-like AGNs by bringing the outlier fractions down to below 7% from 32% (SED-alone) at the end of the survey.",

        "abstract": "For nearly a decade, observations have shown that many older Sun-like stars spin faster than predicted, a phenomenon known as weakened magnetic braking (WMB). The leading hypothesis for WMB is a weakening of the large-scale dipole field, which leads to a less efficient angular momentum loss. To test this hypothesis on a star known to be in the WMB regime, we present the first Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) map of the Sun-like star $\\tau$Ceti, reconstructed using spectropolarimetric data from the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope (CFHT). Our ZDI analysis reveals a remarkably simple, stable and weak ($\\langle B\\rangle =0.17 \\mathrm{G}$) magnetic field, characterized by a predominantly dipolar ($\\sim92\\%$ magnetic energy contained in $l=1$ modes), and highly axisymmetric ($\\sim88\\%$ magnetic energy contained in $m<l/2$ modes) morphology. We infer a dipole field strength of $B_{\\mathrm{dip}}=0.31 \\mathrm{G}$, nearly an order of magnitude weaker than standard braking model predictions, providing direct confirmation of the weakened large-scale dipole predicted by the WMB hypothesis. This work establishes a new benchmark for ZDI, demonstrating that even extremely quiet stars in the WMB regime are accessible to this technique.",

        "abstract": "High-resolution spectroscopic measurements of OB stars are important for understanding processes like stellar evolution, but require labor-intensive observations. In contrast, photometric missions like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) can monitor hundreds of thousands of stars with a range of temporal resolutions, but do not provide such detailed measurements. With surveys like the Legacy Survey of Space and Time promising unprecedented photometric coverage over the next ten years, it is increasingly important to develop methods that connect large-scale time-series photometry with the detailed stellar parameter measurements typically derived from spectroscopy. In this paper, we test whether machine learning can recover such parameters by combining TESS light curves with spectroscopic measurements from the IACOB project, using a sample of 285 light curves from 106 unique O stars. Using both multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that (1) O star light curves contain sufficient information to meaningfully infer stellar parameters and (2) periodograms derived from light curves capture substantially more information than previously identified correlation parameters. Our best model achieves moderate success in predicting both spectroscopic luminosity ($R^2 = 0.641_{-0.167}^{+0.107}$) and effective temperature ($R^2 = 0.443_{-0.234}^{+0.056}$), key stellar parameters for determining positions of stars on the spectroscopic Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, despite the small dataset size.

Despite their relevance in bar evolution, a statistically robust census of these structures in large surveys has been lacking. We aim to provide the largest catalog of BP/X structures in edge-on galaxies to date, and to investigate their properties and role in shaping galaxy scaling relations. We selected a sample of 6684 edge-on galaxies from SDSS DR8 using Galaxy Zoo classifications, requiring a high edge-on probability ($> 0.9$) and a minimum of 10 independent votes. Two-dimensional image decomposition is performed using GALFIT to obtain structural parameters. Residual images are visually inspected to classify BP/X features into four categories: strong both-sided, both-sided, one-sided, and control (no BP/X). We also estimated stellar mass, distance, and physical size for each galaxy. Out of 6653 classified galaxies, we identified 1675 ($\\sim$25%) with both-sided BP/X features-545 ($\\sim$8%) strong and 1130 ($\\sim$17%) faint-as well as 1108 ($\\sim$17%) one-sided structures, making up a total of 2783 BP/X-hosting galaxies ($\\sim$42%). One-sided structures, likely signatures of ongoing buckling, are more frequent than strong both-sided bulges across all stellar masses. The fraction of BP/X bulges increases with stellar surface mass density, indicating a connection with bar formation in dense disks. We also find that galaxies with strong BP/X bulges contribute to increased scatter in the stellar mass-size and stellar mass-surface density relations, particularly at higher masses.",

However, open questions remain regarding the emission mechanism of these bursts. In this work we present results from the first study of an electromagnetic signal produced from a realistic treatment of a binary neutron star merger, both for on-axis and off-axis observations. We accomplish this by using the PLUTO hydrodynamical code to inject a relativistic jet into the ejecta of a realistic binary neutron star merger, which was itself obtained from the simulation of a 3D BNS merger. Then, we model the prompt photospheric emission that would emerge from this jet using the MCRaT radiative transfer code. We find that the resulting photon spectra can peak around ~1 MeV for on-axis emission and falls off noticeably for off-axis observations. We also find distinctly non-thermal low and high-energy tails in multiple observations, ranging from shallow to mid-off axis observations. Our on-axis results are consistent with the Amati Correlation for short bursts, with some strain evident at higher observing angles. Finally, we find that the radiative efficiency is much lower than seen in previous studies of the photospheric emission of long-duration gamma-ray bursts.",

The rate of apsidal motion in such systems can help us constrain their age and gain insight into the degree of mass concentration in the interior of massive stars. Spectroscopic data collected over two decades are used to reconstruct the individual spectra of the stars and to establish their epoch-dependent radial velocities. An orbital solution, explicitly accounting for apsidal motion is adjusted to the data. Space-borne photometric time series are analysed with Fourier methods and with binary models. We derive a rate of apsidal motion of $6.15^{+1.05}_{-1.65}$ degree/yr which suggests an age of $4.13^{+0.42}_{-1.37}$ Myr. The disentangled spectra unveil a curious change in the spectral properties of the secondary star between the epochs 2002-2003 and 2018-2022 with the secondary spectrum appearing of earlier spectral type over recent years. Photometric data show variability at the 6 mmag level on the period of the binary system which is hard to explain in terms of proximity effects. Whilst the rate of apsidal motion agrees well with theoretical expectations, the changes in the reconstructed secondary spectrum hint at a highly non-uniform surface temperature distribution for this star. Different effects are discussed that could contribute to the photometric variations. The currently most-likely explanation is a mix of proximity effects and tidally excited oscillations",

We analyse a sample of Neptune-sized short-period planets with well-measured masses and radii, identifying those whose host stars harbour at least one confirmed outer-giant (OG) companion. On the mass-radius (M-R) plane, the two populations diverge modestly: inner planets in OG systems cluster at systematically larger radii than their counterparts in no-giant (NG) systems, a result that remains suggestive after controlling for planet and stellar properties. Bayesian modelling quantifies the offset, revealing an average radius enhancement of $17 \\pm 4 \\%$ for inner planets in OG systems relative to NG systems at fixed mass. Alternative cuts, including the use of a homogeneous set of parameters, confirm the robustness of the signal, though the result still relies on small-number statistics. Possible mechanisms for the observed inflation include boosted envelope accretion, reduced atmospheric loss, or volatile enrichment by giant-planet stirring. If upheld, this empirical link between outer giants and inflated inner-planet radii offers a new constraint on coupled formation and evolution in planetary systems.",

We explore a range of initial conditions and potential configurations that facilitate such a phantom-to-quintessence-like crossing, and find that this can be naturally realised with hill-top or cliff-face potentials bound from above. We study how varying these conditions affects the dynamics of the system, calculate the background observables and compare them with DESI, CMB, and Type Ia supernova data, identifying a viable parameter space for our model. In particular, we find that a potential featuring a hyperbolic tangent form can successfully reproduce the desired phantom crossing, although such models can suffer from fine-tuning effects.

To further enhance the mitigation performance of adaptive optics, real-time information about the disturbances acting on the control loop is needed. Current systems therefore employ a combination of wavefront sensor- and accelerometer-based filters. In this work, methods using only data from natural- and laser guide star (NGS, LGS) measurements are presented, as telescopes like the Very Large Telescope already have multiple fast and high-resolution wavefront sensors installed. This approach also avoids the costly installation and operation of additional accelerometers on the optical elements.   We introduce two innovative disturbance observer schemes to sense both turbulence and vibration information. A multi-rate estimator for atmospheric influences is based on Kalman filter theory and can incorporate NGS and LGS signals at different loop rates. The estimator for structural perturbations uses Gaussian process regression and can be implemented in an offline and online configuration. We validate the filter designs with data from a realistic end-to-end adaptive optics model with randomly generated turbulence and vibrations. The simulation is fed with on-sky data from the Adaptive Optics Facility of the Very Large Telescope. The presented disturbance observer schemes demonstrate promising results and may be considered as potential alternatives or extensions to existing techniques such as linear-quadratic controllers with Kalman filtering (LQG).",

Two exterior-field mechanisms -- Coulomb-focused capture from ambient media and QED Schwinger pair production -- robustly neutralize such objects across cosmic history. I first derive the general capture rate including both Coulomb and gravitational focusing, and sum the stepwise discharge time in closed form via the trigamma function, exhibiting transparent Coulomb- and gravity-dominated limits. I then integrate the Schwinger rate over the near-horizon region to obtain an explicit $\\dot Q(Q)$ law: discharge proceeds until the horizon field falls below $E_{\\rm crit}$, leaving a residual charge $Q_{\\rm stop}^{(e)}\\!\\propto\\! r_h^2$ that is $\\ll e$ for Planck radii. Mapping the mass dependence from sub-Planckian to astrophysical scales, I also analyze dark-sector charges with heavy carriers (including kinetic mixing and massive mediators). In a conservative ``no-Schwinger'' limit where vacuum pair creation is absent, cumulative ambient exposures alone force discharge of any integer SM charge. Three possible loopholes remain. (i) A fine-tuned SM corner in which the relic sits arbitrarily close to Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om extremality so greybody factors suppress charged absorption, while Schwinger pair creation is absent due to Planck-scale physics. (ii) Charge relocated to a hidden $U(1)_D$ with no light opposite carriers, e.g. if the lightest state is very heavy and/or kinetic mixing with $U(1)_{\\rm EM}$ is vanishingly small. (iii) Discrete or topological charges rather than ordinary SM electric charge. Outside these cases, the conclusion is robust: within SM electromagnetism, charged black-hole relics neutralize efficiently and cannot retain charge over cosmological times.",

It is difficult to investigate these data in isolation, however, as the complicated supernovae pipelines must properly account for selection effects. In this work, we discover that the Bayesian evidence previously found for flexknot dark energy (arXiv:2503.17342) is beaten by a magnitude offset between the low- and high-redshift supernovae. In addition, we find that the possible tension between DES-5Y and DESI is significantly reduced by such an offset.

        "abstract": "In this work we examine the 2025 DESI analysis of dark energy, which suggests that dark energy is evolving in time with an increasing equation of state $w$. We explore a wide range of quintessence models, described by a potential function $V(\\varphi)$, including: quadratic potentials, quartic hilltops, double wells, cosine functions, Gaussians, inverse powers. We find that while some provide improvement in fitting to the data, compared to a cosmological constant, the improvement is only modest. We then consider non-minimally coupled scalars which can help fit the data by providing an effective equation of state that temporarily obeys $w-1$. Since the scalar is very light, this leads to a fifth force and to time evolution in the effective gravitational strength, which are both tightly constrained by tests of gravity. For a very narrow range of carefully selected non-minimal couplings we are able to evade these bounds, but not for generic values.",

We develop numerical models to simulate this effect for two distinct astrophysical scenarios: an emission-line circumstellar disk and an absorption-line binary system. Our simulations reveal a clear sensitivity of this temporal asymmetry to the system's inclination angle, velocity symmetry, and internal dynamics. This suggests that, with sufficiently high time resolution, II can be used to extract quantitative information about internal kinematics, offering a new observational window on stellar dynamics.",

This interaction gives rise to secondary radiation in different wavelength ranges, known as reprocessed emission. In eclipsing LMXBs, the reprocessed emission from the bursts can be examined during eclipses, as the primary emission is blocked and only the reprocessed emission is visible. We searched for bursts during eclipses in the archival RXTE data of the eclipsing LMXBs and found them in EXO 0748-676 and XTE J1710-281. In EXO 0748-676, seven bursts were found to occur near eclipse egress, with their tails extending beyond the eclipse, and one such burst was found for XTE J1710-281. We estimate the reprocessing fraction at orbital phases near eclipse egress by modeling the peculiar eclipse bursts detected in both systems, which have tails extending beyond the eclipses. We observe an increasing trend in reprocessing fraction as these eclipse bursts occur closer to the eclipse egress. We discuss the possibilities of reprocessing in the ablated wind from the companion star, the accretion disc, and the disc wind in EXO 0748-676 and XTE J1710-281. Additionally, we observe two decay components in the bursts in EXO 0748-676, which could suggest a complex composition of the accreting fuel. From the burst rise timescales, we place an upper limit on the size of the reprocessing regions in both EXO 0748-676 and XTE J1710-281, finding it comparable to the size of the respective X-ray binaries.",

High-resolution spectroscopy confirms orbital periods of 1.37 and 2.67 days with circular orbits. The visible components have masses of $\\sim 0.9\\,M_\\odot$, while the minimum masses of the unseen companions are $1.073^{+0.058}_{-0.060} M_\\odot$ and $0.919^{+0.049}_{-0.051} M_\\odot$, respectively.

The absence of detectable spectral features from the companions rules out main-sequence stars of these masses, suggesting that the unseen companions are likely O/Ne or C/O massive white dwarfs. The short orbital periods imply that these systems are post-common envelope binaries.

Cold, charge-neutral, and $\\beta$-equilibrated matter composed of neutrons, protons, electrons, muons, and $\\Lambda$ hyperons is considered. We compute particle fractions, chemical potentials, the EOS, speed of sound, tidal deformability, and stellar structure by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, and compare our results with recent NICER and gravitational-wave observations. The inclusion of $\\Lambda$ hyperons leads to EOS softening, reducing the maximum NS mass from $2.34M_\\odot$ to $2.07M_\\odot$, while keeping it consistent with the $2M_\\odot$ mass constraint. At $1.4M_\\odot$, the model satisfies observational limits on radius and tidal deformability, with the $\\Lambda$ onset occurring below this mass. Comparison with other microscopic and relativistic mean-field models shows that our EOS remains consistent with the allowed pressure-energy density range, while also permitting even canonical-mass NSs of about $1.4M_{\\odot}$ to accommodate hyperons. These results suggest that hyperons can appear in NSs across the observed mass range without violating current astrophysical constraints, and that the extended LOCV method provides a consistent, microscopic approach to modeling dense hypernuclear matter.",

The condensation of $B-L$ Higgs dominating the universe at its decay is the sole source for these generation processes. Here, the infrequent decays of the $B-L$ Higgs to heavy right handed neutrinos and successive prompt decays of these right handed neutrinos around the electroweak phase transition produce the observed baryon number asymmetry, while the complete decay of the same $B-L$ Higgs at a later epoch leads to a large lepton number asymmetry. The right amounts of both asymmetries are found to be obtained for the symmetry-breaking scale $v_\\phi \\sim 10^{10}~{\\rm GeV}$. Moreover, in a close connection to the positivity of both asymmetries, seemingly only the normal mass hierarchy of light neutrino species works. Finally, the gravitational wave background from the topologically stable strong type-I cosmic strings, generated from the breaking of $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, can be within the reach of future experiments such as ultimate DECIGO.",

During this event, a fraction of the mass lost by the primary is accreted onto the secondary, with the accretion rate being dependent on the orbital and stellar parameters. From the set of simulations, we derive an analytical relation describing the dependence of the mass accretion rate on the orbital period and stellar mass ratio. We also identify the transitional orbital period for which Roche lobe overflow begins to dominate over wind accretion. We find that accretion leads to a reduction in the effective temperature of the secondary star. However, the mass average accretion rate we obtain in the simulations is low enough for the secondary to remain in thermal equilibrium and avoid radial expansion.",

        "abstract": "We present a systematic analysis on the X-ray variability in 13 bright quasars at z > 4.5, combining recent Swift observations from 2021 to 2023 and archival multi-epoch observations. Upper limits of the luminosity measurements were included in the analysis by using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method. It is found that the high-z quasars exhibit X-ray variability on both short-term (hours-to-days) and intermediate-term (weeks-to-months) timescales, with short-term variability dominating the overall variation. A linear correlation exists between the global mean ($\\mu_{\\mathrm{L_{2-10\\,keV}}}$) and standard deviation ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{L_{2-10\\,keV}}}$) of X-ray luminosities, which is independent of the X-ray photon index and optical-to-X-ray spectral slope. The localized stochastic magnetic reconnection mechanism is strongly favored, which can naturally lead to a scale-invariant power-law energy distribution and satisfactorily explain the correlation. The $\\sigma$-$\\mu$ correlation parallels with the well-documented rms-flux relation of low-z active galactic nuclei (AGNs), implying the magnetic reconnection mechanism could drive short-timescale X-ray variability in both high- and low-z AGNs. The highest-z quasar in our sample, J142952+544717 (z = 6.18), shows a luminosity distribution extending to ${10}^{47}\\ \\rm{erg\\ {s}^{-1}}$ with a not conspicuous median luminosity. On the other hand, J143023+420436 (z = 4.7), which hosts the most relativistic jet among known high-z blazars, is dominated in the high-luminosity regime (${10}^{47}\\ \\rm{erg\\ {s}^{-1}}$ ), making it an ideal target for multi-wavelength follow-up observations. J090630+693030 is found to have a rest-frame period of 182.46 days and J143023+420436 has a period of 16.89 days, both could be explained by the global evolution of plasmoid chains, in which magnetic islands formed during reconnection may merge successively.",

We find that the detection rate of [O III] DPNEL features in XRGs is 30% compared to just 1% in the general galaxy population (mostly radio quiet). The dual AGN fraction in DPNEL galaxies is found to depend strongly on the radio luminosity, increasing from $\\sim$25% for radio-undetected to $\\sim$58% in the radio-detected sample of general DPNEL galaxies. In contrast, the DPNEL XRGs and FR-II radio galaxies having higher radio power show a $\\sim$95% likelihood of hosting a dual AGN. Secondly, the detection of companion galaxies in more than 30% of DPNEL XRGs suggests a vital role of mergers in the XRG formation. We also investigate the parsec-scale radio structure of the nuclei of several XRGs using Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) maps at 1.4 GHz, 4.3 GHz or 7.6 GHz and find a resolved core for only one of the XRGs. However, the flat spectral indices of the VLBA cores along with the DPNEL components exhibiting AGN characteristics, together with the detection of radio-optical offsets between the VLBA and Gaia position, are strongly indicative of XRGs being likely candidates for hosting dual/binary AGNs.",

        "abstract": "Our ability to observe, detect, and characterize exoplanetary atmospheres has grown by leaps and bounds over the last 20 years, aided largely by developments in astronomical instrumentation; improvements in data analysis techniques; and an increase in the sophistication and availability of spectroscopic models. Over this time, detections have been made for a number of important molecular species across a range of wavelengths and spectral resolutions. Ground-based observations at high resolution are particularly valuable due to the high contrast achievable between the stellar spectral continuum and the cores of resolved exoplanet absorption features. However, the model-independent retrieval of such features remains a major hurdle in data analysis, with traditional methods being limited by both the choice of algorithm used to remove the non-exoplanetary components of the signal, as well as the accuracy of model template spectra used for cross-correlation. Here we present a new algorithm TSD (Transmission Spectroscopy Decomposition) formulated as an inverse problem in order to minimize the number of assumptions and theoretically modelled components included in the retrieval. Instead of cross-correlation with pre-computed template exoplanet spectra, we rely on high spectral resolution and instrument stability to distinguish between the stellar, exoplanetary, and telluric components and velocity frames in the sequence of absorption spectra taken during multiple transits. We demonstrate the performance of our new method using both simulated and real K band observations from ESO's VLT/CRIRES+ instrument, and present results obtained from two transits of the highly-inflated super-Neptune WASP-107 b which orbits a nearby K7V star.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale research infrastructures (LSRIs) are central to contemporary science policy, combining massive capital investments with international access regimes. Yet whether open access to these infrastructures translates into more equitable scientific authority remains contested. Astronomy provides a critical case: world-leading observatories are globally shared but embedded in specific national contexts. We compile a novel country--year dataset (1955--2025) linking the location of astronomical facilities with publication usage and authorship roles. This enables us to distinguish between hosting, using, and leading in telescope-based research. Our analysis reveals: (i) usage and impact are heavily concentrated in a small number of facility hubs; (ii) scientific leadership is even more unequal than access or usage (Gini coefficient 0.91 for first/corresponding authorship versus 0.85 for facilities and usage); (iii) hosting and leadership often decouple--countries such as Chile and South Africa mediate large publication volumes without commensurate gains in leading roles; and (iv) global leadership has shifted from U.S. dominance to a multi-hub system centered in the United States, Western Europe, China, Japan, and Australia. These findings challenge the assumption that international access alone democratizes science. We argue that converting participation into leadership requires domestic PI programs, investments in instrumentation and data pipelines, and governance models that distribute credit more equitably. The study highlights how the governance of LSRIs shapes global scientific hierarchies and offers design principles for infrastructures that seek not only to share data but also to broaden scientific authority.",

Nearby binaries provide opportunities to characterize their properties and orbits through a combination of radial velocities, astrometry, and direct imaging. Eta Cassiopeiae is a bright, well-known binary system for which recent observations have provided greatly improved stellar masses and orbital parameters. We present additional radial velocity data that are used to perform an injection-recovery analysis for potential planetary signatures. We further provide a detailed dynamical study that explores the viability of planetary orbits throughout the system. Our combined analysis shows that giant planets are significantly ruled out for the system, and indeed no planetary orbits are viable beyond $\\sim$8 AU of the primary star. However, terrestrial planets may yet exist within the Habitable Zone where orbits can remain long-term stable. We discuss the implications of these results, highlighting the effect of wide binary companions on giant planet formation, and the consequences for occurrence rates and planetary habitability.",

In this paper, we highlight several often-overlooked properties of these models by analyzing their cosmological perturbations. We show that a non-minimal coupling to gravity is essential for the stability of the setup. However, avoiding propagation of a ghost mode then requires imposing a relation between the coupling coefficients, known as the degeneracy condition, which reduces the bumblebee model to a subset of generalized Proca theories with a marginal non-minimal operator. By imposing the degeneracy condition, the vector field becomes non-dynamical at the background level, and the form of its potential is completely fixed in vacuum. We show that the vacuum expectation value of the vector field can drive a de Sitter solution, for which the effects of the non-minimal coupling are negligible at the background level but provide essential order-one corrections to the sound speed of the scalar mode, keeping the setup weakly coupled at the level of perturbations. Treating this stealth de Sitter solution as a dark energy candidate, we study its coupling to matter and find the effective gravitational coupling for the matter density contrast in the quasi-static regime. At the level of perturbations, the system behaves differently from $\\Lambda$CDM, providing a potential observational signature to distinguish the two models.",

The CO observations show molecular clouds toward the Crab Nebula at a velocity range from about 0 to 16 km/s. After checking the CO spectra, we find shocked signatures in the clouds extending at a velocity of roughly [5, 11] km/s. These shocked molecular clouds, with an angular distance of about 0.4-0.5 degree toward the Crab Nebula, are located at the shell of a bubble discovered in the GALFA-HI (and HI4PI) images at the same velocity range. The dimension of the bubble is roughly 2.3$\\times$2.6 degree and the expansion velocity is about 5 km/s. The kinetic energy referred from the shocked molecular clouds (roughly 3.5$\\times$10$^{51}$ erg), together with the HI bubble, support the picture that the Crab Nebula belongs to a typical core-collapse supernova remnant. Nevertheless, due to the large uncertainty in the distance measurement, further observations are needed to verify the physical association between the shocked molecular clouds and the Crab Nebula.",

        "abstract": "The thermodynamic properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) at the outskirts of galaxy clusters provide valuable insights into the growth of the dark matter halo and the heating of the ICM. Considering the results of the soft X-ray background study of non-cluster Suzaku fields, we revisit 65 Suzaku pointing observations of the Perseus cluster in eight azimuthal directions beyond 1 Mpc (0.8 $r_{500}$). A possible foreground component, whose spectrum is modeled as a 1 keV collisional ionization equilibrium plasma, significantly affects the temperature and density measurements of the ICM in cluster outskirts. The emission measures in the six arms are similar, showing that the radial slopes of temperature and density follow $r^{-0.67\\pm0.25}$ and $r^{-2.21\\pm 0.06}$, respectively. The radial pressure profile is close to the average profile measured by the Planck satellite. The resulting entropy slope is $\\propto r^{0.81\\pm 0.25}$, consistent with the theoretical slope of 1.1. The integrated gas fraction, the ratio of the integrated gas mass to the hydrostatic mass, is estimated to be 0.13$\\pm$0.01 and 0.18$\\pm$0.02 at $r_{500}$ and $r_{200}$, respectively, consistent with the cosmic baryon fraction. These results suggest that the ICM at the cluster outskirts is quite regular and close to hydrostatic equilibrium. The remaining two arms show that the emission measure is higher by a factor of 1.5-2, possibly due to accretion from filaments from the large-scale structure. A sudden drop in the emission measure also occurs in a direction toward one of the filaments.",

In this work, we present for the first time a performance study of CTAO based on joint simulations of steady-state sources emitting both neutrinos and gamma rays, under the assumption that neutrino events are detected by the KM3NeT telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. To identify potentially observable sources, we apply a neutrino-based selection filter according to KM3NeT's discovery potential. We then simulate gamma-ray detectability with CTAO, taking into account visibility, sensitivity, and extragalactic background light absorption. The analysis is specifically focused on exploring the detectability of sources at low neutrino luminosities, limited to values below $10^{52}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,yr^{-1}}$, in order to assess the performance of CTAO and KM3NeT in identifying faint extragalactic emitters. Particular attention is given to the strategic role of KM3NeT's geographic location, which provides access to Southern-sky sources, and to the impact of the planned CTA+ upgrade, which will enhance CTAO-South with Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs).

The Deimos phase curve shows a strong opposition effect due to shadow-hiding, with negligible coherent backscattering. The amplitude and the half-width of the shadow-hiding opposition surge were found to be 2.14 +/- 0.14 and 0.065 +/- 0.004, respectively. We found a high porosity of 86% at the top-layer surface, consistent with complex-shaped grains or fractal aggregates, suggesting a thick dust layer. We did not observe significant variations of the opposition surge across the surface. A blue unit on Deimos, located on streamers of the equatorial ridge, shows reflectance increases up to 58%, and a spectral slope decrease of 50% in comparison with the average surface. This blue unit may be due to a different texture of the surface between the two units, with finer grain and/or higher porosity. Deimos photometric properties, including SSA, opposition surge, and phase integral, are very similar to Phobos. The presence of a blue unit on Deimos reinforces the idea that the Martian moons have a common origin, making the capture of two different bodies with such similar properties unlikely.",

        "abstract": "Space radiation is one of the major obstacles to space exploration. If not mitigated, radiation can interact both with biological and electronic systems, inducing damage and posing significant risk to space missions. Countermeasures can only be studied effectively with ground-based accelerators that act as a proxy for space radiation, typically with a harsher radiation field that worsen the effects of space radiation. Following an in-silico design and optimization process we have developed a galactic cosmic ray (GCR) simulator using a hybrid active-passive methodology. In this approach, the primary beam energy is actively switched and the beam interacts with specifically designed passive modulators. In this paper, we present the implementation of such a GCR simulator and its experimental microdosimetric characterization. Measuring the GCR field is of paramount importance, both before providing it to the user as a validated radiation field and for achieving the best possible radiation description. The issue is addressed in this paper by using a tissue-equivalent proportional counter to measure radiation quality and by comparing experimental measurements with Monte Carlo simulations. In conclusion, we will demonstrate the GCR simulator's capability to reproduce a GCR field.",

We distinguish ALPs -- defined as coupling only to photons and produced via Primakoff scattering -- from axions, which also couple to nucleons and emerge through nuclear bremsstrahlung. We omit pionic axion production due to its large uncertainties and inconsistencies, though it could contribute comparably to bremsstrahlung under optimistic assumptions.

        "abstract": "The field of gravitational wave (GW) detection is progressing rapidly, with several next-generation observatories on the horizon, including LISA. GW data is challenging to analyze due to highly variable signals shaped by source properties and the presence of complex noise. These factors emphasize the need for robust, advanced analysis tools. In this context, we have initiated the development of a low-latency GW detection pipeline based on quantum neural networks (QNNs). Previously, we demonstrated that QNNs can recognize GWs simulated using post-Newtonian approximations in the Newtonian limit. We then extended this work using data from the LISA Consortium, training QNNs to distinguish between noisy GW signals and pure noise. Currently, we are evaluating performance on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset and comparing it against classical methods. Our results show that QNNs can reliably distinguish GW signals embedded in noise, achieving classification accuracies above 98\\%. Notably, our QNN identified 5 out of 6 mergers in the Sangria blind dataset. The remaining merger, characterized by the lowest amplitude, highlights an area for future improvement in model sensitivity. This can potentially be addressed using additional mock training datasets, which we are preparing, and by testing different QNN architectures and ansatzes.",

The NS angular momentum $I$ and moment of inertia (MI) for a slow stationary azimuthal rotation around the symmetry axis is calculated by using the Kerr metric approach in the Boyer-Lindquist and Hogan forms for the perfect liquid-drop model of NSs. The gradient surface terms of the NS energy density $\\mathcal{E}(\\rho)$ [Equation of State] are taken into account along with the volume ones at the leading order of the leptodermic parameter $a/R \\ll 1$, where $a$ is the ES crust thickness and $R$ is the mean NS radius. The macroscopic NS angular momentum $I$ at small frequencies $\\omega$, up to quadratic terms, can be specified for calculations of the adiabatic MI, $\\Theta=d I/d \\omega$, by using Hogan's inner gravitational metric, $r\\le R$. The NS MI, $\\Theta=\\tilde{\\Theta}/(1-\\mathcal{G}_{t\\varphi})$, was obtained in terms of the statistically averaged MI, $\\tilde{\\Theta}$, and its time and azimuthal angle correlation, $\\mathcal{G}_{t\\varphi}$, as sumes of the volume and surface components. The MI $\\Theta$ depends dramatically on its effective radius $R$ because of a strong gravitation.

AdvCam incorporates cutting-edge Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and a fully digital readout system, setting new standards for performance and efficiency. The upgraded camera will feature four times more pixels for the same field of view as the existing PMT-based camera, enabling finer image resolution and significantly improving angular precision and background noise rejection. To cope with the increase in number of pixels, many technological challenges are being tackled, from low power and high speed integrated chip design to real-time data processing on hardware accelerators. This technological leap will lower the energy threshold by allowing operation at lower observation threshold and providing brighter images. The increase in effective area, angular and energy resolution will enhance the sensitivity, unlocking new potential for gamma-ray astronomy. In this work, we present the performance of the AdvCam's core building blocks and its innovative architecture capable of enabling unprecedented triggering capabilities.

How asteroids release their kinetic energy in the atmosphere is not well understood due to the rarity of significant impacts. Ordinary chondrites, in particular L chondrites, represent a frequent type of Earth-impacting asteroids. Here, we present the first comprehensive, space-to-lab characterization of an L chondrite impact. Small asteroid 2023 CX1 was detected in space and predicted to impact over Normandy, France, on 13 February 2023. Observations from multiple independent sensors and reduction techniques revealed an unusual but potentially high-risk fragmentation behavior. The nearly spherical 650 $\\pm$ 160 kg (72 $\\pm$ 6 cm diameter) asteroid catastrophically fragmented around 28 km altitude, releasing 98% of its total energy in a concentrated region of the atmosphere. The resulting shockwave was spherical, not cylindrical, and released more energy closer to the ground. This type of fragmentation increases the risk of significant damage at ground level. These results warrant consideration for a planetary defense strategy for cases where a >3-4 MPa dynamic pressure is expected, including planning for evacuation of areas beneath anticipated disruption locations.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the effects of strong magnetic fields on the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star matter and the resulting implications for tidal deformability measurements in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. A critical issue with previous magnetized neutron star studies is the treatment of magnetic field anisotropy in the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. To address this fundamental problem, we employ the chaotic magnetic field approximation, which allows for a self-consistent treatment of magnetic pressure while maintaining isotropy. Using a relativistic mean field approach with properly implemented magnetic field corrections, we compute mass-radius relations and tidal deformability parameters for neutron stars with magnetic field strengths ranging from $10^{15}$ to $10^{16}$ G. Our systematic study reveals that magnetic fields induce increases in both stellar radii (0.8--2.3\\%) and tidal deformabilities (4.2--18.1\\%) compared to field-free cases, with effects scaling approximately as $B^{1/2}$. These modifications, while modest, are potentially detectable with current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors. For a canonical $1.4\\,M_\\odot$ neutron star, the tidal deformability increases from $\\Lambda_{1.4} = 678 \\times 10^6$ in the absence of magnetic fields to $\\Lambda_{1.4} = 803 \\times 10^6$ for $B = 10^{16}$ G. We demonstrate that magnetic field effects must be considered when constraining the neutron star equation of state using gravitational wave observations, particularly for populations including highly magnetized neutron stars. Our results suggest that the current GW170817 constraint on tidal deformability may require systematic corrections when accounting for magnetic field effects. We provide scaling relations for magnetic field corrections and discuss the implications for population studies of neutron star mergers with next-generation detectors.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in ground-based astronomy have made it possible to create optical telescopes with primary mirrors up to 40 m in size. With growing mirror diameter, the suppression of non-atmospheric disturbances becomes increasingly important. Precise knowledge of the movement of telescope mirrors is essential for understanding and compensating for vibration-based perturbations. A model from VLT accelerometer data for each individual mirror is developed, while the influence of wind buffeting is accounted for by a von Karman wind model. To describe the relevant rigid body motion, we consider the piston, tip and tilt modes of the mirrors. The identification is validated by comparing the power spectral density of the measured and identified modes. Additionally, we assess the robustness of the approach by calculating the identification error over different sections of the data. The study indicates that the employed methods are adequate for the identification of modal telescope vibrations. It is anticipated that said findings will serve as a significant foundation for the development of advanced model-based AO controllers for large telescopes, such as linear quadratic Gaussian control.",

        "abstract": "Coronal loops are plasma structures in the solar atmosphere with temperatures reaching millions of Kelvin, shaped and sustained by the magnetic field. However, their morphology and fundamental nature remain subjects of debate. By studying their cross-sectional properties and how they change along the loop and in time, we can understand their magnetic structure and heating mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the cross-sectional intensity profiles, both spatially and temporally, of two unique coronal loops, observed in the periphery of two distinct active regions by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI/HRI$_{\\rm EUV}$) on board the Solar Orbiter spacecraft. The main results of this study are 1. The lifetimes of these two loops (loop1 > 120 min \\& loop2 > 50 min) are longer than the typical timescales of radiative cooling and thermal conduction. 2. Their widths determined by the FWHM of the single Gaussian fit to the cross-axis intensity profiles are greater than 6-7 pixels of EUI/HRI$_{\\rm EUV}$, indicating that the loop cross-section is uniformly filled on well-resolvable scales. 3. These loops exhibited an almost constant width, both spatially and temporally (width for loop1 is 2.1 $\\pm$ 0.4 Mm and for loop2 is 1.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 Mm), indicating that they are stable non-expanding structures. 4. We present observational evidence that the one of the loops (loop2) is not braided, which strongly suggests that the non-expanding nature of this multi-stranded loop along its length cannot be attributed to the twist of the magnetic field lines. In conclusion, we find that these coronal loops are long, stable, multi-stranded, non-expanding structures with a uniform cross-section that persist in the corona for an unusually extended duration. This not only challenges our current understanding of the structure of the coronal magnetic field but also raises critical questions about the mechanisms",

We show that both truncations have an $O(d+p,d)$ symmetry when reduced on a $d$-dimensional torus and demonstrate how this embeds in the $O(d+p,d+p)$ symmetry that one gets from reducing on a $(d+p)$-dimensional torus without truncation. We then use our new truncation to obtain four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution and compute thermodynamic quantities and multipole moments. Finally, we compare the Kerr-Sen solutions of the actions corresponding to the two different choices of truncation with the Kerr solution, the Kerr-Newman solution, and each other, and show that they have distinct four-derivative multipole structures.",

We analyze data from the O3a and O3b data acquisition campaign, during which the sensitivity of ground-based detectors is limited by real non-Gaussian noise transient. The state-of-the-art searches for such signals tipically rely on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a chi-square test to assess the consistency of the signal with an inspiral template. In addition, a combination of these and other statistical properties are used to build a 're-weighted SNR' statistics. We evaluate a Random Forest classifiers on a set of double-coincidence events identified using the MBTA pipeline. The new classifier achieves a modest but consistent increase in event detection at low false positive rates relative to the standard search. Using the output statistics from the Random Forest classifier, we compute the probability of astrophysical origin for each event, denoted as $p_\\mathrm{astro}$. This is then evaluated for the events listed in existing catalogs, with results consistent with those from the standard search. Finally, we search for new possible candidates using this new statistics, with $p_\\mathrm{astro} > 0.5$, obtaining a new subthreshold candidate (IFAR =0.05) event at $gps: 1240423628$ .",

Here the usual type-I seesaw mechanism generates neutrino mass, and a net lepton asymmetry is generated from the co-annihilation of the dark matter and the $Z_2$-odd singlet fermion. The $Z_{2}$-even singlet scalar is important in dark matter phenomenology. Successful leptogenesis is possible at TeV-scale, unlike the vanilla case.

Additional observations ruled out Earth impact by 2025-02-23. However, the probability of lunar impact in December 2032 then rose, reaching about 4% by the end of the apparition in May 2025. James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations on 2025-03-26 estimated the asteroid's diameter at 60 +/- 7 m. Studies of 2024 YR4's potential lunar impact effects suggest lunar ejecta could increase micrometeoroid debris flux in low Earth orbit up to 1000 times above background levels over just a few days, possibly threatening astronauts and spacecraft. In this work, we present options for space missions to 2024 YR4 that could be utilized if lunar impact is confirmed. We cover flyby & rendezvous reconnaissance, deflection, and robust disruption of the asteroid. We examine both rapid-response and delayed launch options through 2032. We evaluate chemical and solar electric propulsion, various launch vehicles, optimized deep space maneuvers, and gravity assists. Re-tasking extant spacecraft and using built spacecraft not yet launched are also considered. The best reconnaissance mission options launch in late 2028, leaving only approximately three years for development at the time of this writing in August 2025. Deflection missions were assessed and appear impractical. However, kinetic robust disruption missions are available with launches between April 2030 and April 2032. Nuclear robust disruption missions are also available with launches between late 2029 and late 2031. Finally, even if lunar impact is ruled out there is significant potential utility in deploying a reconnaissance mission to characterize the asteroid.",

In this work, we report the findings of the first test of this technique using ESA's Tropospheric Delay Calibration System (TDCS) at the complex in Malargue. The data consists in 14 tracking passes of the BepiColombo spacecraft collected between October 2023 and March 2024 during two separate test campaigns. We analyzed the performance of the beam-crossing technique and compared it with the nominal radiometer pointing through the analysis of the Doppler residuals extracted from the orbit determination process. Results show that the beam-crossing performed similarly to the standard pointing, with modest noise reductions and improved stability only at time scales between 100 s and 300 s. Key factors affecting the results include the antenna elevation and the boundary layer height, indicating the need to revisit initial test assumptions, which comprised a fixed boundary layer. Furthermore, comparing the beam-crossing test results with those obtained during the first two BepiColombo superior solar conjunction experiments highlights a potential application of this technique during periods of solar conjunction. However, technical challenges, adverse weather, and limited Ka-band transponder use, reduced the number of analyzed tracking passes. Future studies should therefore expand the dataset to consolidate the results. Furthermore new theoretical studies and test campaigns should elaborate on the selection process for the optimal crossing height.",

        "abstract": "Pulse profile stability in millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is a key factor in achieving high-precision timing essential for detecting nanohertz gravitational waves with Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). In this work, we present a systematic analysis of profile stabilization timescales in MSPs using a direct method based on pulse stacking, applied to long-term multi-epoch observations. Our study utilizes data from the upgraded GMRT (uGMRT) between 300--750 MHz for nine MSPs over 3--5 years and Parkes Ultra-Wideband low-frequency receiver observations (Parkes UWL; covering 704--4032 MHz) for three of them. We find that stable profiles typically require averaging over $10^{5}$--$10^{6}$ pulses. This is the first time such a quantitative approach has been applied to MSPs across a wide frequency range, providing an indirect but practical estimate of jitter noise, a dominant noise source in PTA datasets. We observe that stabilization timescales depend on signal-to-noise ratio, pulse morphology, and surface magnetic field strength, with a moderate correlation indicating a possible role of the magnetic field in emission stability. A complementary single-epoch analysis of nine bright MSPs with uGMRT Band-3 (300--500 MHz) reinforces these results and demonstrates the method's applicability to broader MSP populations. We show that a strong correlation exists between profile-stability slope and the jitter parameter, implying that for faint MSPs, profile-stability analysis can act as an effective proxy for intrinsic pulse-shape variability. Our work provides a novel and scalable framework to assess intrinsic profile variability, helping to guide integration time choices and reduce timing noise in PTA experiments.",

        "abstract": "While astronomical twilight closes the observing window for optical astronomers, the infrared sky remains dark even through sunrise, allowing IR astronomers to observe through twilight. The Slicer Combined with an Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (SCALES) instrument is a 2-5 micron coronagraphic integral field spectrograph scheduled to arrive at Keck in early 2026. SCALES has the potential to execute exciting science and support the astronomical community and upcoming NASA missions through a dedicated cadenced twilight observing program. We estimate that the current twilight observing program on Keck conducts 18+-1 hours per year of science observations; a facilitized twilight observing program that is prioritized by the observatory could yield 151+-2 hours of science time per year. This work presents the scientific motivation and high-level feasibility of two primary SCALES twilight science cases, monitoring of Solar System objects and a high-contrast imaging search for exoplanets around bright nearby stars, taking lessons from the existing NIRC2 and OSIRIS Twilight Zone program and considering increases in program scope. We also consider technical and operational challenges to overcome before the SCALES instrument begins its twilight observing program.",

        "abstract": "Stellar rotation is a fundamental parameter governing a star's magnetic activity and evolution. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides high-precision photometric data ideal for measuring rotation periods via brightness modulations from starspots. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the star TIC 445493624 using 2-minute cadence data from TESS Sector 58. We process the light curve using a custom pipeline to perform outlier removal, binning, and Savitzky-Golay detrending to isolate the stellar variability. A Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the cleaned data reveals a single, dominant periodic signal at 3.638 days with a power of 0.43, corresponding to a negligible false-alarm probability. The phase-folded light curve at this period is highly coherent and exhibits a stable, non-sinusoidal morphology indicative of large-scale magnetic features or spot groups.",

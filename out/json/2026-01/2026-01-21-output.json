Recent high-resolution simulations have shown a variety of stellar-to-halo mass ratios for dwarf galaxies with a DM halo mass of $\\sim 10^9 M_{\\odot}$ at $z=0$. In this study, we performed cosmological $N$-body/smoothed-particle hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of dwarf galaxies with the highest gas and DM particle mass resolutions of 2.37 $M_{\\odot}$ and 12.8 $M_{\\odot}$, respectively. The stellar-to-DM halo mass ratio of one of our simulated dwarf galaxies was $\\sim 10^{-4}$, typical for satellites of the Milky Way. The stellar mass ($10^5 M_{\\odot}$) and half-mass radius (68 pc) were also similar to those of the satellites of the Milky Way. The power-law slope of the DM halo was $\\alpha = -1.1$. On the other hand, the other simulated galaxy exhibited a stellar-to-halo mass ratio of $\\sim 10^{-3}$ and a steeper power-law slope ($\\alpha=-1.9$) than the other; the presence of baryonic matter deepened the cusp. The mass of $>10^6 M_{\\odot}$ and a half-mass radius of $\\sim 36$ pc of this galaxy were similar to those of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies rather than the satellites of the Milky Way. This DM halo grew in mass earlier than the former one, and the central DM density was higher than that of the other even in the DM-only simulations.",

        "abstract": "Asteroseismology is widely used for precise determining of masses of solar-like oscillating stars by performing individual-frequency modeling or applying homological scaling relations. However, these methods lack dynamical validation on the main sequence due to the absence of eclipsing double-lined binary system (SB2) as benchmark objects. By providing the orbital inclination, astrometric binary systems from ESA Gaia DR3 offer an abundant alternative for eclipsing systems. We present KIC693187 as the first SB2, hosting a solar-like oscillating post-main-sequence star with dynamical masses. By combining Gaia astrometry with spectroscopic obtained with the Las Cumbres Observatory network (LCO), we find $M_1^\\mathrm{dyn}$=0.99$\\pm$0.05$M_\\odot$ and $M_2^\\mathrm{dyn}$=0.89$\\pm$0.04$M_\\odot$ for the primary and secondary, respectively. Asteroseismic parameters were extracted from photometry of the NASA \\Kepler satellite. The mass from individual frequency modeling is $M_1^\\mathrm{IF}$=0.92$\\pm$0.01$M_\\odot$. Taking into account the systematic uncertainty of 0.04$M_\\odot$ for best fit models from individual frequency fitting, we find an agreement within 1.2$\\sigma$. From scaling relations we obtain a mass range of 0.93 to 0.98$M_\\odot$ by using the observed large frequency separations (\\dnu) in the scaling relations for the primary. By using standard corrections for departures from the asymptotic regime of \\dnu, we obtained a mass range of 0.83 to 1.03$M_\\odot$. The upper ends of both ranges agree well with the dynamical mass of the primary. This approach provides the first empirical validation for main-sequence solar-like oscillators and opens a new window for validating asteroseismology. Through a dedicatded program targeting astrometric SB2 binary systems, ESA's PLATO space mission will provide will enlarge the benchmark sample substantially.",

Based on historical records, however, the last core-collapse galactic supernova observed by humans occurred almost 1,000 years ago. Luckily, we are well positioned to catch the next one with the advent of new neutrino detectors and astronomical observatories. Neutrino observatories can provide unprecedented triggers for a galactic supernova event as they are likely to see a supernova neutrino signal anywhere from minutes to days before the shock breakout causes the supernova to brighten in optical wavelengths. Given its large etendue, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is ideally positioned to rapidly localize the optical counterpart based on the neutrino trigger. In this paper we simulate events to study the efficiency with which supernovae are optimally localized by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We find that the observatory is ideal for initial localization of nearly all observable supernova triggers and has a 57-97% chance of catching any supernova based on theoretical stellar mass density predictions and observations. We provide an analysis of optimal filter selection and exposure times and discuss observational caveats.",

        "abstract": "Context. Understanding the survival and orbital evolution of brown dwarf (BD) companions during the post-main-sequence (MS) evolution of their host stars is increasingly important, especially with recent discoveries of many substellar companions around white dwarfs (WDs). Aims. We investigate the long-term evolution and final outcomes of BDs orbiting low-mass MS stars as these evolve into WDs. By comparing forward-modeling populations with observed WD-BD binaries, we test evolutionary models and predict the existence of yet-undetected systems. Methods. We employ the COMPAS binary population synthesis code to evolve observed MS-BD systems through the post-MS phases of their host stars into the WD stage, tracking orbital changes driven by mass loss, tides, and common-envelope (CE) evolution. Results. Our simulations reproduce a period gap in the distribution of detached WD-BD binaries, consistent with observations. We also identify a boundary separating detached and semi-detached systems on the period-mass diagram, located at orbital periods of $\\sim$1-2 hours depending on the BD mass. Conclusions. We predict that a subset of currently known MS-BD binaries will survive post-MS evolution and emerge as detached WD-BD systems, while others will undergo CE evolution and potentially form cataclysmic variables with BD donors. Our results reproduce the observed period gap in WD-BD binaries and provide quantitative predictions for the role of CE efficiency in shaping their distribution. This work predicts that many WD-BD systems remain undetected, motivating targeted searches with microlensing and high-contrast imaging techniques using next-generation large telescopes.",

By simulating and taking account of point-source emission from the active galactic nucleus (AGN), we detect iron-line emission $\\sim$ 20--60 pc away from the nucleus, particularly in the eastern and western regions. In the two regions, possible time variability in the line flux was also detected. Our spectral analysis then finds that the observed equivalent widths can reach $\\sim$ 2 keV and the slopes of underlying continua are rather inverted with $\\Gamma < 0$. These are consistent with a scenario in which the iron emission originates from clouds illuminated by AGN X-rays; our result could provide the first extragalactic example of AGN X-ray echoes. In this scenario, we estimated the physical sizes of the illuminated clouds based on the timescale of variability to be less than 6 pc. Furthermore, we compared the iron emission distribution with the cold molecular distribution inferred by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observation of CO($J$=3--2), revealing that in the region of bright iron-line emission, the molecular emission seems to be weak. This might suggest that the AGN X-ray emission affects the chemical composition in the form of AGN feedback.",

        "abstract": "Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes) are critical tracers of intermediate- and high-mass star formation, yet their census remains incomplete compared to low-mass young stellar objects like T-Tauri stars. To expand the known population, we systematically searched for HAeBes in LAMOST DR7 low-resolution spectra. Following Sun et al., we applied Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, identifying $\\sim$240,000 spectra with potential H$\\alpha$ emission. After removing contaminants (non-stellar objects, extragalactic sources, CVs, and Algol systems) and restricting to B/A-type stars, we obtained 1,835 candidates through 2MASS/WISE visual inspection. Spectral energy distribution analysis confirmed 143 sources with infrared excess ($J$-band or longer wavelengths), including 92 known HAeBes. From the remaining 51 candidates, we classified 26 with strong infrared excess as new HAeBes. Color-index analysis of confirmed HAeBes and classical Ae/Be stars (CAeBes) revealed that the $(K-W1)_0$ vs. $(W2-W3)_0$ diagram effectively separates these populations: CAeBes predominantly occupy $(K-W1)_0 \\leq 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 \\leq 1.1$, while other regions trace transition disks ($(K-W1)_0  1.1$), globally depleted disks ($(K-W1)_0 > 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0  0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 > 1.1$). More importantly, the HAeBes exhibit a clear evolutionary gradient on this diagram, with those in the Class III, Class II, Flat-SED, and Class I evolutionary stages being effectively distinguished by concentric ellipses that are roughly centered at (0,0) with semi-major axes of $a$=1.5, $a$=3.0, and $a$=4.0, and a semi-major to semi-minor axis ratio of 1.6:1.",

The coronal X-ray activity of HD 166620 has so far only been probed with a ROSAT/HRI observation in 1996, near the chromospheric activity maximum before the star entered its grand minimum around 2004. We conducted a deep {\\it XMM-Newton} observation of HD 166620 during its chromospheric Ca II H&K activity grand minimum to achieve a better understanding of its magnetic activity. We detected HD 166620 with an X-ray luminosity of ${{\\rm log}\\,L_{\\rm X}\\,\\rm{(erg\\,s^{-1})}=26.56^{+0.10}_{-0.12}}$, corresponding to ${{\\rm log}\\,(L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm bol}) = -6.58^{+0.10}_{-0.12}}$ and an X-ray surface flux of log Fx (erg/cm^2/s) = 3.97+0.10-0.12. With respect to the earlier ROSAT observation, the X-ray brightness of HD 166620 has decreased by a factor of 2.5 during its Maunder minimum-like state. To place its X-ray properties into context, we constructed an X-ray sample of late-type stars within 10 pc of the Sun. The activity of HD 166620 is below the levels of all other K dwarfs in the 10 pc sample. The corona of HD 166620 during its grand minimum emits at the level of the solar background corona, which implies that it has no large active magnetic structures. Along with long-term Ca II H&K monitoring of HD 166620, this result provides evidence that the solar activity during the Maunder minimum was not reduced significantly below the levels seen during its present-day cycle minima. The similar X-ray surface flux of HD 166620 and the modern quiet Sun, and also their Rossby number near the critical value of spin-down models, suggest a connection between the regime of weakened magnetic braking and the occurrence of Maunder minimum states.",

Atmospheric retrievals are uniquely suited to analyse these datasets and characterize the aerosols present in exoplanet atmospheres. However, including the optical properties of condensed particles within retrieval frameworks remains computationally expensive, limiting our ability to fully exploit JWST observations. In this work, we improve the computational efficiency and scaling behavior of aerosol models in atmospheric retrievals, enabling in-depth studies including multiple condensate species within practical time scales. Rather than computing the aerosol Mie coefficients for each sampled model, we pre-compute extinction efficiency (Qext), scattering efficiency (Qscat) and asymmetry parameter (g) grids for seven condensate species relevant in exoplanet atmospheres (Mg2SiO4 amorph sol - gel, MgSiO3 amorph glass, MgSiO3 amorph sol - gel, SiO2 alpha, SiO2 amorph, SiO and Titan tholins). The pre-computed Qext grids significantly reduce computation time between 1.4 and 17 times with negligible differences on the retrieved parameters. They also scale effortlessly with the number of aerosol species while maintaining the accuracy of cloud models. Thereby enabling more complex retrievals as well as broader population studies without increasing the overall error budget. The Qext, Qscat and g grids are freely available on Zenodo as well as a public TauREx plugin -TauREx-PCQ- that utilize them.",

This paper presents an overview of the R2Pub telescope system, including its design, instrumentation, and survey capabilities, and reports an initial evaluation of its system performance. R2Pub is a prime-focus binocular system, with each optical tube covering a field of view of approximately 18 square degrees. It is designed to detect a wide range of transient and variable sources in the local universe, such as variable stars, eclipsing binaries, supernovae, gamma-ray burst afterglows, tidal disruption events, active galactic nuclei, and other unknown transients. The observatory infrastructure, including the dome, equatorial mount, optical tubes, and associated subsystems, has been fully constructed and installed, and the system has entered the commissioning phase. Benefiting from the high-altitude location, good seeing conditions, and dark sky background at the Daocheng site, performance tests during commissioning show that the R2Pub system can reach a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of about 18.7 mag in the Pan-STARRS r' band with a 60 s exposure. Ongoing observations with R2Pub are expected to contribute to studies of variable and transient phenomena and to enhance public outreach in astronomy. The binocular design enables simultaneous dual-band observations, providing instantaneous color information for transient sources and improving the classification and physical characterization of their properties and evolution.",

        "title": "A multi-wavelength study of the 2025 low state of the intermediate polar BG CMi",
        "abstract": "We present multi-wavelength observations of the first recorded low state of the intermediate polar BG CMi. Optical monitoring of the source by members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers reveals a decrease of ~0.5 mag that lasted ~50 d in early 2025. During the low state the optical timing properties imply that BG CMi underwent a change in the accretion mode, as power at the spin frequency $\\omega$ dramatically dropped. An XMM-Newton observation revealed a substantial decrease in intrinsic absorption and a slight increase in intrinsic X-ray luminosity, compared to archival Suzaku data. Timing analysis of the X-ray light curves shows that power shifted from the orbital frequency $\\Omega$ (prominent in Suzaku data) to $2\\Omega$ in the low state XMM-Newton data, along with the strengthening of certain orbital sidebands. We suggest that BG CMi transitioned to disk-overflow accretion, where the white dwarf accreted matter via both a disk and a stream, the latter becoming more dominant during the low state due to a decrease in the mass and size of the disk.",

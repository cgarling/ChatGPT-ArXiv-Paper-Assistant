        "abstract": "Dark galaxies are small, DM-dominated halos whose gas remains in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium and has never formed stars. They are of particular interest because they represent a strong prediction of the LCDM model. As of today, only a handful of candidates have been observed, the most intriguing of which being Cloud-9. Using several state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations, we aim to predict the abundance of dark galaxies expected within our Local Group (LG), characterise their properties and provide guidance for their potential detection. We analyse LG simulations with constrained initial conditions, run with different codes, implementing different baryonic physics, feedback prescriptions, and employing two distinct values of SF density threshold, n_th=0.13 and 10 cm^-3, to select samples of dark and bright galaxies harboured in haloes of similar mass. We demonstrate that dark galaxies exist in such simulations, though their number is larger in simulations that use a higher, more realistic n_th. These galaxies, whose gas remains diffuse and never forms stars, predominantly inhabit less-concentrated, higher-spin DM halos than their luminous counterparts. Dark galaxies are typically found in low-density regions at the outskirts of the LG, and their evolution across z indicate that both the DM and gas densities in their surroundings were consistently lower than those found around bright galaxies, making them less susceptible to interactions, mergers, or gas inflows. We estimate that up to 8 dark galaxies should be detectable in HI emission within 2.5 Mpc of the LG, with the FAST telescope, accounting for its sky coverage and minimum M_HI and N_HI. Current hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies, combined with upcoming HI surveys, will offer a direct and powerful test of LCDM through their ability to predict and measure properties of dark galaxies within and beyond the LG.",

        "abstract": "The rotation curves of regularly rotating disc galaxies are a unique probe of the gravitational potential and dark matter distribution. Until recently, matter decomposition of rotation curves at $z>0.5$ was challenging, not only due to the lack of high resolution kinematic data but also of both suitable photometry to accurately trace the stellar surface density and spatially-resolved sub-mm observations to trace the cold gas distribution. In this paper, we analyse three galaxies from the Archival Large Program to Advance Kinematic Analysis (ALPAKA) sample, combining highly resolved cold gas observations from ALMA with rest-frame near-infrared imaging from JWST to investigate their dynamical properties and constrain their dark matter halos. The galaxies, initially classified as regularly rotating discs based on ALMA observations alone, appear in JWST as extended and symmetric stellar discs with spiral arms. Our dynamical models reproduce the rotation of the discs in the outer parts well, but they systematically underpredict the inner rotation velocities, revealing a deficit of central mass relative to the data. This discrepancy indicates either an underestimation of the bulge masses due to variations in the stellar mass-to-light ratio or dust attenuation or the presence of overmassive black holes. Alternatively, it may suggest departures from standard dark-matter halo profiles, including enhanced central concentrations.",

        "abstract": "We present the first comprehensive spectroscopic and deep photometric study of the globular cluster (GC) candidate Patchick~126. The spectroscopic analysis is based on high-resolution near-infrared data obtained with the IGRINS spectrograph, while the photometric analysis relies on HST observations from the Hubble Missing Globular Cluster Survey (MGCS). We derived abundances for $\\alpha$-(O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), light-(C, N), odd-Z (Na, Al), iron-peak (Fe, Co, Cr, Ni, Mn, V), and s-process elements (Ce) for four red giant stars observed in the H and K bands. Our results yield a mean metallicity of $\\langle\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\\rangle = -0.30\\pm0.03$, with no evidence of intrinsic variation, and an $\\alpha$-enhancement of $\\langle\\mathrm{[\\alpha/Fe]}\\rangle =+0.19\\pm0.02$, consistent with the trends of metal-rich Galactic GCs. We detect an intrinsic C-N anti-correlation, but no Na-O or Al-Mg anti-correlations, in agreement with expectations for low-mass, metal-rich clusters. From the HST photometry, we constructed deep CMDs extending $\\sim 2-3$ magnitudes below the MSTO. This depth allowed us to provide the first robust age estimate for the cluster. Applying the methods developed within the CARMA project, we derive an age of $11.9^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$~Gyr. We obtain a photometric metallicity of [Fe/H]$=-0.28$, in agreement with the spectroscopic results. The colour excess we derived, E(B-V) = 1.08, confirms that Patchick~126 is a heavily reddened cluster, located at a heliocentric distance of 7.8 kpc. From the orbital parameters, including energy, vertical angular momentum, circularity, and maximum vertical height, we find that Patchick~126 closely follows a disc-like orbit. Taken together, these results confirm that Patchick 126 is an in situ, low-mass globular cluster of the Milky Way, exhibiting properties that lie at the boundary between old-OCs and GCs.",

Approximately 1000 HII region complexes are detected in both galaxies and analyzed using their strong optical emission lines. Their properties were studied via BPT diagrams and their luminosity function. We conducted a detailed study of the distribution of oxygen abundance across the system using a series of strong-line O/H indicators and calibrations. Both galaxies exhibit negative galactocentric abundance gradients with a slope -0.015 dex kpc$^{-1}$. There are marginal signs of discontinuities in the O/H gradients with some indicators while no significant azimuthal variations are seen. A shallower slope in the HII region luminosity function between the arm and inter-arm regions in IC 2163 is observed, supporting previous conclusion that the star formation process in this galaxy eyelids has been altered during the interaction. The kinematics of the ionised gas reveal disturbed velocity fields, AGN-like features in the nucleus of NGC 2207, and elevated velocity dispersion in turbulent or feedback-driven regions. To interpret these findings, we modeled the collision using the numerical algorithm GCD+. The simulation reproduces key features of the system and demonstrates how close passages drive enhanced star formation and localized chemical enrichment. Finally, two dwarf galaxies in the field are found to have very similar systemic velocities as their larger counterparts, and could well play a minor role in the global interaction based on their morphology and position.",

To overcome the former, searches for gravitationally lensed sources allow for the discovery of magnified SNe that appear as multiple images - further providing the opportunity for efficient follow-up. Here we present the discovery of \"SN Eos\": a strongly lensed, multiply-imaged, SN II at a spectroscopic redshift of z = 5.133 +/- 0.001. SN Eos exploded in a Lyman-{\\alpha} emitting galaxy when the Universe was only ~1 billion years old, shortly after it reionized and became transparent to ultraviolet radiation. A year prior to our discovery in JWST data, archival HST imaging of SN Eos reveals rest-frame far ultraviolet (~1,300{\\AA}) emission, indicative of shock breakout or interaction with circumstellar material in the first few (rest-frame) days after explosion. The JWST spectroscopy of SN Eos, now the farthest spectroscopically confirmed SN ever discovered, shows that SN Eos's progenitor star likely formed in a metal-poor environment (<= 0.1 Z_{\\odot}), providing the first direct evidence of massive star formation in the metal-poor, early Universe. SN Eos would not have been detectable without the extreme lensing magnification of the system, highlighting the potential of such discoveries to eventually place constraints on the faint end of the cosmic star-formation rate density in the very early Universe.",

Nearby spirals, including the Milky Way, host thin and thick components that may arise either from an early turbulent phase or from the subsequent dynamical heating of an initially thin disc; measuring disc thickness across cosmic time therefore offers a direct test of these scenarios. We present a new methodology to measure the thickness of edge-on galaxies that explicitly accounts for small departures from perfectly edge-on orientations by fitting a full three-dimensional model with forward modelling. This improves on traditional approaches that assume an inclination of $90^\\circ$ and can bias thicknesses high. Applying the method to \\textit{JWST} imaging of galaxies at $1<3$ with stellar masses $\\gtrsim 10^9~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ from four major surveys, we measure a median scale height of $z_0 = 0.25\\pm0.14~\\mathrm{kpc}$ and a median ratio $h_r/z_0 = 8.4\\pm3.7$. These values are consistent with the Milky Way and local thin discs, but imply scale heights $\\sim 1.6$ times smaller than those inferred for local galaxies from single-disc fits. This result implies that thin discs are already present at $z\\sim3$. We further show that a thick disc contributing 10\\% of the thin-disc luminosity would be detectable in the data considered in this work, implying that any thick disc present must be fainter and favouring a scenario in which thick discs build up progressively through dynamical heating.",

        "abstract": "We consider the oxygen abundance distributions for a sample of massive spiral galaxies from the MaNGA survey in which the radial abundance gradient flattens to a constant value outside of the outer break radius, Rb,outer. The outer break radius can be considered as a dividing radius between the galaxy and the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The values of the Rb,outer range from 0.8R_{25} to 1.45R_{25}, where R_{25} is the optical radius of the galaxy. The oxygen abundances in the CGM range from 12+log(O/H) ~ 8.0 to ~ 8.5. The O/H distribution in each of our galaxies also shows the inner break in the radial abundance profile at the radius Rb,inner. The metallicity gradient in the outer part of the galaxy is steeper than in the inner part. The behaviour of the radial abundance distributions in these galaxies can be explained by assuming an interaction with (capture of the gas from) a small companion and adopting the model for the chemical evolution of galaxies with a radial gas flow. The interaction with a companion results in the mixing of gas and a flat metallicity gradient in the CGM. The capture of the gas from a companion increases the radial gas inflow rate and changes the slope of the radial abundance gradient in the outer part of the galaxy.",

        "abstract": "The possibility to constrain cosmological parameters from galaxy surveys using field-level machine learning methods that bypass traditional summary statistics analyses, depends crucially on our ability to generate simulated training sets. The latter need to be both realistic, as to reproduce the key features of the real data, and produced in large numbers, as to allow us to refine the precision of the training process. The analysis presented in this paper is an attempt to respond to these needs by (a) using clusters of galaxies as tracers of large-scale structure, together with (b) adopting a 3LPT code (Pinocchio) to generate a large training set of $32\\,768$ mock X-ray cluster catalogues. X-ray luminosities are stochastically assigned to dark matter haloes using an empirical $M-L_X$ scaling relation. Using this training set, we test the ability and performances of a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the cosmological parameters, based on an input overdensity field derived from the cluster distribution. We perform a comparison with a neural network trained on traditional summary statistics, that is, the abundance of clusters and their power spectrum. Our results show that the field-level analysis combined with the cluster abundance yields a mean absolute relative error on the predicted values of $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and $\\sigma_8$ that is a factor of $\\sim 10 \\%$ and $\\sim 20\\%$ better than that obtained from the summary statistics. Furthermore, when information about the individual luminosity of each cluster is passed to the CNN, the gain in precision exceeds $50\\%$.",

        "abstract": "The slitless spectroscopic method employed by missions such as Euclid and the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) faces a fundamental challenge: spectroscopic redshifts derived from their data are susceptible to emission line misidentification due to the limited spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. This effect systematically introduces interloper galaxies into the sample. Conventional strict selection not only struggles to secure high redshift purity but also drastically reduces completeness by discarding valuable data. To overcome this limitation, we develop an XGBoost classifier that leverages photometric properties and spectroscopic diagnostics to construct a high-purity redshift catalog while maximizing completeness. We validate this method on a simulated sample with spectra generated by the CSST emulator for slitless spectroscopy. Of the $\\sim$62 million galaxies that obtain valid redshifts (parent sample), approximately 43% achieve accurate measurements, defined as $|\\Delta z| \\leq 0.002(1+z)$. From this parent sample, the XGBoost classifier selects galaxies with a selection efficiency of 42.3% on the test set and 42.2% when deployed on the entire parent sample. Crucially, among the retained galaxies, 96.6% (parent sample: 96.5%) achieve accurate measurements, while the outlier fraction ($|\\Delta z|>0.01(1+z)$) is constrained to 0.13% (0.11%). We verified that simplified configurations which exclude either spectroscopic diagnostics (except the measured redshift) or photometric data yield significantly higher outlier fractions, increasing by factors of approximately 3.5 and 6.3 respectively, with the latter case also introducing notable catastrophic interloper contamination. This framework effectively resolves the purity-completeness trade-off, enabling robust large-scale cosmological studies with CSST and similar surveys.",

We study the [C II], CO(7-6), [C I](2-1), and, in SPT0418-47, $p$-H$_2$O emission, which along with the underlying continuum (rest-frame 160 $\\mu$m and 380 $\\mu$m) are routinely used as tracers of gas mass and/or star-formation rate (SFR). We perform a pixel-by-pixel analysis of both sources in the image plane to study the resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, finding generally good agreement between the slopes of the SFR versus gas mass surface density using the different tracers. Using lens modeling methods, we find that the dust emission is more compact than the line emission in both sources, with CO(7-6) and [C I](2-1) similar in extent and [C II] the most extended, reminiscent of recent findings of extended [C II] spatial distributions in galaxies at similar cosmic epochs. We develop the [C I](2-1) / CO(7-6) flux density ratio as an observable proxy for gas depletion timescale ($\\tau_{\\rm dep}$), which can be applied to large samples of DSFGs, in lieu of more detailed inferences of this timescale which require analysis of observations at multiple wavelengths. Furthermore, the extended [C II] emission in both sources, compared to the total continuum and line emission, suggests that [C II], used in recent years as a molecular gas mass and SFR tracer in high-$z$ galaxies, may not always be a suitable tracer of these physical quantities.",

In the classical astrophysical methodology, multi-band continuum data are required to derive the dust temperature. The present study aims to investigate the capability and limitations of machine learning techniques to derive dust temperatures in regions without multi-band dust continuum data. We investigated how the number of pixels used for training influences prediction accuracy, and how the dust temperatures sampled in the training area influence prediction accuracy. We found that $\\sim$5\\% of the total number of pixels in the observational region is sufficient for training to obtain accurate predictions. Furthermore, a dust temperature sample within the training area should cover the whole temperature range and have a similar sample distribution to that of the entire observing region for an accurate prediction. The $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO ratio is often found to be the most important feature in predicting the dust temperature. As the $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO ratio is a tracer of PDR, the machine learning technique could connect the dust temperatures to the PDRs. We also found that the condition of thermal gas-dust coupling is not required for accurate prediction of the dust temperature from the molecular line data, and that machine learning is capable of capturing information more than classical astrophysical concepts.",

Recent observations have identified nanojets as small-scale (length $\\lesssim 6.6$~Mm, width $\\lesssim 1$~Mm), fast ($\\sim$~few 100 km s$^{-1}$), and short-lived ($\\lesssim 30$~s) ejections associated with nanoflare-scale energies, providing evidence of magnetic reconnection at small spatial scales.

In this Letter, we present synthetic observations of the coalescence of two flux ropes, leading to nanojet-like signatures from a numerical model obtained with the \\texttt{MPI-AMRVAC} code. We report synthetic observables in Extreme-ultraviolet lines compatible with existing instruments such as SDO/AIA, and upcoming MUSE mission, and compare the synthetic observables with an existing observation of nanojets. The synthetic diagnostics of the emissivity maps, Doppler velocity, thermal, and non-thermal line broadening produce key observational properties, suggesting a plausible 3D scenario for nanojet generation where tiny flux ropes reconnect within loops. Our results provide predictions for the detectability of nanojets with current and future spectroscopic facilities, and establish a bridge between MHD modeling and observations.",

Current global three-dimensional simulations lack the resolution to capture the small-scale dynamics around the embedded companion, while local wind-tunnel simulations always approximate the companion's orbital motion as linear rather than as rotation around the center of mass. We investigate how rotation, accretion, and stratification influence small-scale gas dynamics, gravitational drag and lift forces, and the spin-up rate of the companion. We perform three-dimensional local hydrodynamic simulations of a $0.2\\, M_\\odot$ compact companion plunging into the envelope of a $2\\, M_\\odot$ red giant in a reference frame rotating at the companion's orbital angular velocity, using the Athena++ code. The presence of stratification generates an inward-directed force, partially opposed by a rotation-induced outward lift force. Both the resulting inward directed force and the drag force, strongly influenced by stratification, would affect the evolution of the binary separation. We propose revised semi-analytical prescriptions for both drag and lift forces. Without accretion and for sufficiently small gravitational softening radii, a quasi-hydrostatic bubble forms around the companion, while accretion prevents its formation and converts kinetic energy into heat that could contribute to the envelope ejection. Drag and lift forces are only marginally affected by accretion. The companion spin-up rate varies non-monotonically in time, first increasing and then decreasing as it plunges deeper into the envelope. These results motivate future magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate how accretion, rotation, and stratification affect magnetic amplification, and how magnetic fields, in turn, influence mass and angular momentum accretion rates, as well as the drag and lift force exerted on the companion.",

As a result, the majority of imaged galaxies will visually overlap, a phenomenon known as blending. Blending is expected to be a leading source of systematic error in astronomical measurements. To mitigate this systematic, we propose a new probabilistic method for detecting, deblending, and measuring the properties of galaxies, called the Bayesian Light Source Separator (BLISS). Given an astronomical survey image, BLISS uses convolutional neural networks to produce a probabilistic astronomical catalog by approximating the posterior distribution over the number of light sources, their centroids' locations, and their types (galaxy vs. star). BLISS additionally includes a denoising autoencoder to reconstruct unblended galaxy profiles. As a first step towards demonstrating the feasibility of BLISS for cosmological applications, we apply our method to simulated single-band images whose properties are representative of year-10 LSST coadds. First, we study each BLISS component independently and examine its probabilistic output as a function of SNR and degree of blending. Then, by propagating the probabilistic detections from BLISS to its deblender, we produce per-object flux posteriors. Using these posteriors yields a substantial improvement in aperture flux residuals relative to deterministic detections alone, particularly for highly blended and faint objects. These results highlight the potential of BLISS as a scalable, uncertainty-aware tool for mitigating blending-induced systematics in next-generation cosmological surveys.",

We conduct three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the converging flow of atomic gas, including a simple chemical network and tracer particles that move along the local velocity field.

The diffuse part of forming molecular clouds is CO-poor; i.e., H$_2$ and CO abundances do not correlate. In diffuse regions of $n_\\mathrm{H}\\lesssim 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, we find that the abundances of hydrocarbons and oxygen-bearing molecules are determined by steady-state chemistry reflecting the local H$_2$ abundance, which is determined by the gas density along the trajectory. In denser regions, the abundances are affected by water ice formation, which changes the elemental abundance of carbon and oxygen (i.e., C/O ratio) in the gas phase. Assuming quasi-steady-state chemistry given the abundances of major molecules (e.g., H$_2$) from the simple network, we derive analytic solutions for molecular abundances, which reproduce the calculation results. We also calculate the molecular column densities based on the spatial distribution of tracer particles and their molecular abundances, and compare them with observations of diffuse molecular clouds. We find that the column densities of CH, CCH, and OH are linearly correlated with those of H$_2$, which supports the empirical relation used in the observations. On the other hand, the column density of HCO$^+$ shows non-linear dependence on the H$_2$ column density, reflecting the difference in HCO$^+$ formation paths in CO-poor and CO-rich regions.",

Moreover, for photon energies above a few GeV and incidence angles up to several degrees, the pair-production cross-section exhibits a pronounced dependence on the angle between the crystal axis and the photon polarization vector. \\\\ In this work we show that these effects could be exploited to develop a novel class of light-weight pointing space-borne $\\gamma$-ray telescopes, capable of achieving an improved sensitivity and resolution, thanks to a better shower containment in a smaller volume with respect to non-oriented crystalline detectors. We also show that an oriented tracker-converter system could be used to measure the polarization of a $\\gamma$-ray source above few GeV, in a regime that remains unexplorable through any other detection technique. This novel detector concept could open new pathways in the study of the physics of extreme astrophysical environments and potentially improve the detector sensitivity for indirect Dark Matter searches in space.",

        "abstract": "Observations indicate that disc fragmentation due to Gravitational Instability (GI) is the likely origin of massive companions to stars, such as giant planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, Brown Dwarf (BD) companions to FGK stars, and binary stars with separations smaller than 100 au. Additionally, we have recently showed that disc fragmentation in young rapidly evolving binary systems ejects an abundant population of massive Jupiter-mass Free-Floating Planets (FFPs). In this model, a massive disc around an initially single protostar undergoes GI and hatches a number of fragments; the most massive oligarch grows by runaway accretion into the secondary star. As the system rearranges itself from a single to a binary star configuration, a dramatic \"pincer movement\" by the binary ejects planets through dynamical interactions with the stars. Here we propose that the same scenario applies to an even more abundant population of smaller FFPs discovered by the microlensing surveys. Although disc fragmentation is usually believed to form only massive objects, several pathways for forming small core-dominated planets at separations of tens of au exist. We present results from three complementary simulation approaches, all of which confirm planet ejection efficiency as high as 0.5 for secondaries more massive than $\\sim 10$\\% of the primary star mass. On the other hand, Jovian mass planets migrate through the region of tens of au too rapidly to eject planets from that region. We discuss implications of this scenario, concluding that microlensing FFPs may be the most convincing evidence yet that disc fragmentation forms planets much less massive than Jupiter.",

One of those is nitrous oxide (N2O), which was searched for but not found in solid form from as early as Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) mission was launched. The observational capabilities of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) present a possibility to identify solid interstellar N2O.   Aims. We aim to identify nitrous oxide in open JWST spectra of interstellar ices towards a sample of Class 0, 0/I and flat protostars using the relevant laboratory mixtures of N2O-bearing interstellar ice analogues.   Methods. A set of laboratory infrared transmission spectra was obtained for the following mixtures: N2O:CO2=1:20, N2O:CO=1:20, N2O:N2=1:20, N2O:CO2:CO=1:15:5, N2O:CO2:N2=1:15:13 at 10-23 K. A search for N2O in JWST NIRSpec spectra towards 50 protostars was performed by fitting the 4.44-4.47 um (2250-2235 cm-1) NN-stretch absorption band with new laboratory mixtures of N2O-bearing ices.   Results. We claim the first secure identification of N2O in 16 protostars. The fitting results show that N2O is formed predominantly within the apolar layer of the ice mantles, rich in CO, CO2 and N2. The abundance of solid N2O is estimated as 0.2-2.1% relative to solid CO. We present band strengths for N2O in the mixtures corresponding to the apolar layer. Also, an identification of the C-N stretch band at 4.42 um (2260 cm-1) is reported, which we tentatively assign to HNCO, the simplest C-N bond carrier.",

While the $\\Lambda$CDM model successfully describes a wide range of observations, the physical nature of dark energy is still unknown, motivating the study of alternative theories of gravity. Among these, $f(R)$ models provide a well-established extension of General Relativity, capable of reproducing a $\\Lambda$CDM-like background evolution without introducing an explicit dark energy component. However, they can induce deviations in the growth of cosmic structures, making them testable through observables sensitive to cosmological perturbations. In this work, we use weak gravitational lensing to constrain several viable $f(R)$ gravity models. We analyze their impact on the matter power spectrum, as well as on the convergence and cosmic shear power spectra. Our analysis is carried out within a Bayesian framework using the \\textit{Cobaya} code and its modified gravity extension, \\textit{MGCobaya}, which enables consistent theoretical predictions and their comparison with current weak lensing and CMB lensing data. We find that standard cosmological parameters remain consistent with the $\\Lambda$CDM scenario for all models considered, as expected from their background degeneracy.

        "abstract": "Context. Understanding the optical properties of astrophysical ices is crucial for modeling dust continuum emission and radiative transfer in cold, dense interstellar environments. Molecular nitrogen (N$_2$), a major nitrogen reservoir in protoplanetary disks, plays a key role in nitrogen chemistry, yet the lack of direct terahertz (THz)--infrared (IR) optical constants for N$_2$ ice introduces uncertainties in radiative transfer models, snowline locations, and disk mass estimates.   Aims. We present direct measurements of the optical properties of N$_2$ ice over a broad THz--IR spectral range using terahertz pulsed spectroscopy (TPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and comparison with literature data.   Methods. N$_2$ ice was grown at cryogenic temperatures by gas-phase deposition onto a cold silicon window. The THz complex refractive index was directly reconstructed from TPS data, while the IR response was derived from FTIR measurements using Kramers--Kronig relations. The optical response was parameterized with a Lorentz dielectric model and validated by DFT calculations.   Results. The complex refractive index of N$_2$ ice is quantified from $\\nu = 0.3$--$16$~THz ($\\lambda = 1$~mm--$18.75~\\mu$m). Resonant absorption peaks at $\\nu_\\mathrm{L} = 1.47$ and $2.13$~THz with damping constants $\\gamma_\\mathrm{L} = 0.03$ and $0.22$~THz are attributed to optically active phonons of the $\\alpha$-N$_2$ crystal.   Conclusions. We provide a complete set of the THz--IR optical constants for \\ce{N2} ice by combining TPS and FTIR spectroscopy.

        "abstract": "Elemental abundances, which are often depleted with respect to the solar values, are important input parameters for kinetic models of interstellar chemistry. In particular, the amount of carbon relative to oxygen is known to have a strong effect on modeled abundances of many species. While previous studies have focused on comparison of modeled and observed abundances to constrain the C/O ratio, the effects of this parameter on the underlying chemistry have not been well-studied. We investigated the role of the C/O ratio on dark cloud chemistry using the NAUTILUS code and machine learning techniques for molecular representation. We find that modeled abundances are quite sensitive to the C/O ratio, especially for carbon-rich species such as carbon chains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). CO and simple ice-phase species are found to be major carbon reservoirs under both oxygen-poor and oxygen-rich conditions. The appearance of C3H4 isomers as significant carbon reservoirs, even under oxygen-rich conditions, indicates the efficiency of gas-phase C3 formation followed by adsorption and grain-surface hydrogenation. Our model is not able to reproduce the observed, gas-phase C/H ratio of TMC-1 CP at the time of best fit with any C/O ratio between 0.1 and 3, suggesting that the modeled freeze-out of carbon-bearing molecules may be too rapid. Future investigations are needed to understand the reactivity of major carbon reservoirs and their conversion to complex organic molecules.",

Moreover, some of the most promising candidate progenitor systems leading to Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) involve sdO/Bs. LAMOST J065816.72+094343.1 has been identified as such a candidate. To explore the nature and evolutionary future of LAMOST J065816.72+094343.1, we complemented archival spectroscopic data with additional time series spectra and high-resolution spectroscopy of the object. After combining these with photometric data, we determined the orbital parameters of the system and the mass of the companion. We solved the orbit of the system by analyzing 68 low- and medium-resolution spectra using state-of-the-art mixed local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE model atmospheres. Additionally, we gathered nine high-resolution spectra to determine atmospheric parameters and the projected rotational velocity of the sdOB. The inclination angle of the system was constrained assuming tidal synchronization of the sdOB, which was verified via analysis of the ellipsoidal variations in the TESS light curve. We determine LAMOSTJ065816.72+094343.1 to be a binary consisting of a massive $0.82 \\pm 0.17 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ sdOB component with a $1.30^{+0.31}_{-0.26} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ unseen companion. Due to the companion's mass being very close to the Chandrasekhar mass limit and high for a white dwarf, it is unclear whether it is a white dwarf or a neutron star. We find the system to be in a close orbit, with a period of $P=0.31955193 \\mathrm{d}$ and an inclination angle of $i = 49.6^{+5.2}_{-4.2} \\mathrm{deg}$. While the exact nature of the companion remains unknown, we determine the system to either lead to a SN Ia or an intermediate mass binary pulsar, potentially after a phase as an intermediate-mass X-ray binary.",

At a redshift of z=0.0868, revealed by Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectroscopy of its faint and diffuse star-forming host, it is the fourth-nearest example of its class to date. Rapid identification of the source in the Zwicky Transient Facility data stream permitted ultraviolet-through-optical observations to be obtained prior to peak, allowing the first determination of the peak bolometric luminosity (2x10^45 erg/s), maximum photospheric radius (10^15 cm), and total radiated energy (10^51 erg) of an 18cow-like object. We present results from a comprehensive multiwavelength observing campaign, including a far-UV spectrum from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope and deep imaging extending >100 days post-explosion from the Very Large Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, Very Large Array, and Atacama Large Millimetre Array. We interpret the observations under a model in which a powerful rapidly-accreting central engine blows a fast (~0.15c) wind into the surrounding medium and irradiates it with X-rays. The high Doppler velocities and intense ionization within this wind prevent any identifiable features from appearing in the ejecta or in the surrounding circumstellar material, even in the far-ultraviolet. Weak H and He signatures do emerge in the spectra after 35 days in the form of double-peaked narrow lines. Each peak is individually narrow (full width ~3000 km/s) but the two components are separated by ~6600 km/s, indicating stable structures of denser material, possibly representing streams of tidal ejecta or an ablated companion star.",

They show fast rises and declines, high temperatures throughout their evolution, and non-thermal emission in radio and X-rays. Their power source is currently unknown, but proposed models include engine-driven supernovae, interaction-powered supernovae, shock cooling emission, intermediate mass black hole tidal disruption events (IMBH TDEs), and Wolf-Rayet/black hole mergers, among others. AT2024wpp is the most optically luminous LFBOT to date and has been observed extensively at multiple wavelengths, including radio, optical, UV, and X-rays. We take models from multiple scenarios and fit them to the AT2024wpp optical, radio, and X-ray light curves to determine if which of these scenarios can best describe all aspects of the data. We show that none of the multiwavelength light curve models can reasonably explain the data, although other physical arguments favour a stellar mass/IMBH TDE of a low mass star and a synchrotron blast wave. We discuss how this scenario can be tested with late-time observations, and what other scenarios could possibly explain the broadband data.",

We model these effects through a parameterized waveform framework that incorporates a set of parameters that quantify potential deviations from general relativity.

        "abstract": "It has long been thought that black hole accretion flows are driven by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, and there are now many general relativistic global simulations illustrating the dynamics of this process. However, many challenges must be overcome in order to predict observed spectra from luminous systems. Ensuring energy conservation, local thermal balance, and local ionization equilibrium, our post-processing method incorporates all the most relevant radiation mechanisms: relativistic Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung, and lines and edges for 30 elements and all their ions. Previous work with this method was restricted to black holes of $10 M_\\odot$; here, for the first time, we extend it to $10^8 M_\\odot$ and present results for two sub-Eddington accretion rates and black hole spin parameter 0.9. The spectral shape predicted for stellar-mass black holes matches the low-hard state for the lower accretion rate and the steep power law state for the higher accretion rate. For high black hole mass, both accretion rates yield power-law continua from $\\sim 0.5 - 50$~keV whose X-ray slopes agree well with observations. For intermediate mass black holes, we find a soft X-ray excess created by inverse Compton scattering of low-energy photons produced in the thermal part of the disk; this mechanism may be relevant to the soft X-ray excess commonly seen in massive black holes. Thus, our results show that standard radiation physics applied to GRMHD simulation data can yield spectra reproducing a number of the observed properties of accreting black holes across the mass spectrum.",

Consistent with astrophysical expectations for mergers of second generation BHs with first generation BHs, we find that this subpopulation has mass ratios below $0.59^{+0.18}_{-0.23}$. We also infer that $19$-$88\\%$ of the BBH population below this mass ratio is consistent with belonging to the hierarchically-merged population.

IMRPhenomXE extends the quasi-circular IMRPhenomXAS waveform model for the dominant $(\\ell, |m|) =$ (2,2) modes to eccentric binaries. For the inspiral part, orbit-averaged equations of motion within the quasi-Keplerian parametrization up to third post-Newtonian order, including spin effects, are evolved, and the waveform modes are computed using the stationary phase approximation on eccentricity expanded expressions up to $\\mathcal{O}(e^{12})$. The model assumes circularization at merger-ringdown, where it adopts the underlying quasicircular IMRPhenomXAS baseline. We show that IMRPhenomXE reduces to the accurate IMPhenomXAS model in the quasi-circular limit. Compared against 186 public numerical relativity waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog with initial eccentricities up to $~0.8$, IMRPhenomXE provides values of unfaithfulness below $3\\%$ for $72\\%$ of simulations with initial eccentricities below 0.4. For larger eccentricities, the unfaithfulness degrades up to $\\gtrsim 10\\%$ due to the underlying small eccentricity expansions and additional modelling approximations. In terms of speed, IMRPhenomXE outperforms any of the existing inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric waveform models. We demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and modularity of IMRPhenomXE through injections into zero noise and parameter-estimation analyses of gravitational-wave events, showing that IMRPhenomXE is a ready-to-use waveform model for gravitational-wave astronomy in the era of rapidly growing event catalogs.",

Another puzzling phenomenon is temperature inversion in the solar corona. These two issues are deeply connected. We develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) for electromagnetically driven kinetic plasmas, deriving a Fokker-Planck equation for the simultaneous relaxation of multiple species, with (i) a drive diffusion coefficient for the heating of dressed particles directly by the drive and indirectly by waves, and (ii) Balescu-Lenard diffusion and drag coefficients for internal turbulence and Coulomb collisions. Both electron and ion distributions relax towards a universal attractor with a $v^{-5}$ $(E^{-2})$ tail, akin to a $\\kappa = 1.5$ distribution, under a super-Debye (but sub-Larmor) drive with a steep power-spectrum. This is an outcome of Debye screening: large-scale fields accelerate the unscreened, fast particles but not the screened, slow ones. The universality may be broken by shallow power-spectra and incomplete relaxation. Collisions cannot decelerate suprathermal particles, rendering a high $v$ tail immune to Maxwellianization. Such a tail may be generated in the solar corona by chromospheric convection despite collisional losses. The suprathermal particles escape sun's gravity (velocity filtration), inverting the temperature profile and raising it to $10^6$ K. A proper analysis of velocity filtration with a $\\kappa \\approx 1.5-2$ distribution inspired by QLT provides a reasonable fit to the spectroscopic data of heavy ions and explains the abrupt temperature rise, a consequence of the divergence of pressure in the $\\kappa \\to 1.5$ limit.",

It is therefore theorised that brown dwarf companions are unlikely to form or remain in this period range. The Gaia space telescope is uniquely sensitive to companions in this period range, making it an ideal tool to conduct a survey of the brown dwarf desert. In this study, we use Bayesian inference to analyse data from nearby (<200pc) Sun-like stars in Gaia's DR3 catalogue, assuming single companions. From this, we identify 2673 systems (2.41% of the sample) with possible brown dwarf companions in this period range. Accounting for observational biases, we find that 10.4+0.8-0.6% of nearby Sun-like stars have astrometric errors consistent with a brown dwarf-mass companion with a period less than 5 years, significantly higher than previous studies which reported occurrence rates of 10MJ), high-mass brown dwarfs (>50MJ) in this period range are comparatively rare.

Passive radio sciences, including radio astronomy, Earth remote sensing, and meteorology, operate under fundamentally different constraints. They rely on exceptionally low interference spectrum and are highly vulnerable to even brief radio frequency interference. We examine whether DSS can benefit passive services or whether it introduces new failure modes and enforcement challenges. We propose just-in-time quiet zones (JITQZ) as a mechanism for protecting high value observations and assess hybrid frameworks that preserve static protection for core passive bands while allowing constrained dynamic access in adjacent frequencies. We analyze the roles of propagation uncertainty, electromagnetic compatibility constraints, and limited spectrum awareness. Using a game theoretic framework, we show why non-cooperative sharing fails, identify conditions for sustained cooperation, and examine incentive mechanisms including pseudonymetry-enabled attribution that promote compliance. We conclude that DSS can support passive radio sciences only as a high-reliability, safety-critical system. Static allocations remain essential, and dynamic access is viable only with conservative safeguards and enforceable accountability.",

Millimeter dust emission and its polarization provide key insights into the physical processes and material distribution at the envelope-disk interface. We present ALMA polarimetric observations at 1.4 mm and 3 mm of two young stellar objects in Taurus, IRAS 04166+2706 (K04166) and IRAS 04169+2702 (K04169), probing scales from 25 au to 3000 au. We model the Stokes I emission to separate disk and envelope contributions and analyze the polarization properties to identify the dominant polarization mechanisms.   K04166 shows extended Stokes I and polarized emission tracing a tentative hourglass magnetic field morphology in its envelope. In the inner envelope and disk (< 100 au), the properties of the polarized emission change, suggesting either a toroidal magnetic field or the presence of large grains. In contrast, K04169 exhibits compact Stokes I and polarized emission consistent with self-scattering from the disk. Both disks are extremely compact, but only K04166 retains a substantial envelope.   Our multiscale ALMA polarimetric observations reveal a transition from magnetically aligned grains in envelopes to self-scattering in disks within the transition region of 20-50 au. These results provide important clues on dust grain growth and magnetic field morphology at the disk-envelope scales. Despite being embedded in the same filament, the two sources display striking differences, indicating that K04166 is a young embedded object with a substantial envelope threaded by relatively organized magnetic fields. Meanwhile, K04169 is more evolved, likely to be a young T-Tauri star. However, in both disks, the presence of large grains already suggests a scenario of early dust evolution in disks of the Class 0 stage.",

        "abstract": "(Abridged) In the low-mass star formation process, theoretical models predict that material from the infalling envelope could be shocked as it encounters the outer regions of the disk. Nevertheless, only a few protostars show evidence of these shocks at the disk-envelope interface, and the main formation path of shocked-related species is still unclear. We present new ALMA observations of IRS 44, a Class I source that has previously been associated with accretion shocks, taken at high angular resolution (0.1\"). We target multiple molecular transitions of CO, H2CO, and simple sulfur-bearing species. In continuum emission, the binary nature of IRS 44 is observed for the first time at sub-millimeter wavelengths. Infalling signatures are seen for the CO line and the emission peaks at the edges of the continuum emission around IRS 44 B, the same region where bright SO and SO2 emission is seen. Weak CS and H2CO emission is observed, while OCS, H2S, and H2CS transitions are not detected. IRS 44 B seems to be more embedded than IRS 44 A, indicating a non-coeval formation scenario or the rejuvenation of source B due to late infall. CO emission is tracing the outflow component at large scales, infalling envelope material at intermediate scales, and two infalling streamer candidates are identified at disk scales. Infalling streamers might produce accretion shocks when they encounter the outer regions of the infalling-rotating envelope. These shocks heat the dust and release S-bearing species as well as promoting a lukewarm chemistry in the gas phase. With the majority of carbon locked in CO, there is little free C available to form CS and H2CS in the gas, leaving an oxygen-rich environment. The high column densities of SO and SO2 might be a consequence of two processes: direct thermal desorption from dust grains and gas-phase formation due to the availability of O and S.",

        "abstract": "A central magnetar engine is commonly invoked to explain energetic supernovae, which should have multiple signals in multiwavelength emission. Photoionization from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) can create distinct spectroscopic signals in the nebular phase. Recent models suggest infrared emission, particularly from Ne II, can be prominent at late times. This work examines the cooling power of optical and infrared transitions to determine which lines contribute strongly to cooling and on what timescale. The models show infrared cooling becomes strong at $\\sim$ 3 years post-explosion and dominates by 6 years, with [Ne II] 12.8$\\mu$m being the strongest coolant. The fraction of total cooling in the infrared increases sharply once the PWN luminosity decreases below 10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and this fraction also increases with increasing ejecta mass and decreasing average PWN photon energy. However, the emission from [Ne II] 12.8$\\mu$m increases with increasing PWN luminosity and increasing ejecta mass. Cooling at 1 year is dominated by optical O and S lines, with infrared Ar, Ni, and Ne lines becoming strong at 3 years. Optical cooling is almost negligible at 6 years, with the supernova cooling almost entirely through mid- and far-infrared transitions. JWST spectroscopy with MIRI should be able to detect these lines out to $z \\sim 0.1$. Supernovae with higher magnetic fields transition to infrared cooling on earlier timescales, while infrared-dominated supernovae should have strong emission from neutral atoms and emit strongly in radio at sub-decade timescales.",

Applying this method to a two-lens CMB telescope with non-ideal AR coating, we show that polarization-dependent transmission can produce a rotation of the far-field polarization angle that varies across the focal plane with a typical amplitude of 0.05-0.5 degrees.

We present a polarimetric study of the HH objects HH 80 and HH 81 from where non-thermal emission has been confirmed through spectral index measurements at low frequencies. We carried out observations of HH 80 and HH 81 with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in 4-6 GHz. Unlike the inner jet knots, no linear polarization is detected towards the knots HH 80 and HH 81. We place a $3\\sigma$ upper limit of $30~\\mu$Jy on the polarization intensity, corresponding to fractional polarization limits of $\\Pi_{\\max}\\approx0.02$ and $0.01$ for HH 80 and HH 81, respectively. To interpret this non-detection, we assess the conditions for synchrotron polarization and the impact of depolarization mechanisms. The shock cooling parameter $\\chi_\\mathrm{s}$ is lower in these outermost HH objects than in the inner knots, indicating that the reverse shocks in HH 80-81 are less efficient at accelerating relativistic electrons compared with the inner knots. Moreover, Faraday depolarization appears severe: the dispersion in the estimated rotation measure $\\sigma_{\\rm RM}\\sim400~\\mathrm{rad~m^{-2}}$ is comparable to or larger than observed RM values themselves. This is consistent with strong fluctuations and turbulence. Together with beam depolarization, these effects can suppress the observable fractional polarization flux densities below the detectable thresholds. We conclude that reduced acceleration efficiency (when compared to inner knots) and strong depolarization account for the absence of polarized emission towards HH 80 and HH 81.",

Leveraging the wide bandwidth covering a velocity range at 2300 km/s, we successfully detect broad (> 700 km/s) multi-component SO J_N = 3_3 - 2_2 absorption against the sub-parsec-scale continuum structure. The absorption profile consists of both redshifted and blueshifted components, including a newly identified blueshifted feature at -412 km/s relative to the systemic velocity. Significant SO absorption is confined to the central components, with no substantial detection toward the outer jet components. This constrains the location of SO gas to a compact region smaller than 0.45 pc in the sub-parsec vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). Our results support the scenario in which SO molecules are evaporated through shock heating caused by jet-torus interaction. The SO gas clumps are likely driven outward by the jet, with some returning toward the SMBH as inflowing material. Comparison with 321 GHz H2O masers reveals partial similarities in spatial distribution and radial velocity, suggesting that the jet-torus interaction may also trigger the excitation of H2O masers.",

These LGTs stand as bona-fide symmetries of cosmological perturbation theory with various applications, from consistency relations constraining cosmological correlators to non-linear conservation laws in the separate-universe approach. In this work, we revisit LGTs and derive two new results. First, we show that the global symmetries already identified in the literature can be extended to local infinite-dimensional symmetries. The associated generators depend on arbitrary functions of time, and generate low-multipole modes that modify the mean curvature energy and the angular momentum of the patch, demonstrating their physical nature. We propose to interpret these low-multipole soft modes as a new cosmological-frame ambiguity that needs to be fixed prior to evaluating cosmological observables. Second, we demonstrate that the adiabatic cosmological perturbations generated by LGTs deform but preserve all the explicit and hidden Killing symmetries of the background geometry. As such, long-wavelength modes stand as a concrete example of algebraically-special cosmological perturbations of Petrov-type O, and inherit the conformal group as isometries and a set of four deformed Killing-Yano tensors and their associated Killing tensors. This opens the possibility to study their effect on cosmological observables in a fully analytic manner.",

Our flexible models resolve three distinct peaks at $\\sim10$, $18$, and $33\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and are statistically preferred over standard parametric models, with Bayes factors up to 226. Because these features are correlated with $H_0$, the semiparametric model yields, under different prior assumptions, 12%-21% improvement in the precision of $H_0$ relative to parametric models, providing $H_0 = 57.8^{+21.9}_{-20.6}\\,\\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ in the best case.

We analyze the properties of GRB 180728A's prompt emission, afterglow, and associated supernova SN 2018fip, comparing them with other GRB-SN events. This study employs a dense photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of the afterglow and the SN up to 80 days after the burst, supported by image subtraction to remove the presence of a nearby bright star, and modelling of both the afterglow and the supernova. GRB 180728A lies on the $E_{p,i}-E_{\\gamma,iso}$ plane occupied by classical collapsar events, and the prompt emission is one of the most energetic at $z  20,000 km s^{-1}$), dominant early-on, and a more massive, low-velocity component, which dominates at much later epochs.

We examine whether stellar prominence ejection can plausibly account for the observed radio bursts that have been attributed to electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission. Our analysis shows that ejected prominences can produce the required energy range to drive the emission, and that modelled ECM visibility exhibits a rotational phase dependence consistent with the limited observational data (four observed bursts). The results support prominence ejection as a viable mechanism for ECM generation on V374 Peg and motivate further observational campaigns to constrain this process.",

        "abstract": "Full-disk observations from missions such as the SDO and SOHO have enabled comprehensive studies of solar oscillations and dynamics. Interpreting helioseismic and photospheric data is complicated by systematic center-to-limb variations. To explore the physical origin of these variations, we perform local 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations that include effects of solar rotation to generate 24-hour synthetic time series of continuum intensity and Doppler velocity for nine viewing angles spanning from -75 to 75 degrees. The simulations reveal a systematic decrease in oscillation power toward the limbs and a pronounced East-West asymmetry that increases with frequency, primarily due to rotation-induced flows. With increasing angular distance from the disk center, the amplitudes and widths of the surface gravity (f) and resonant pressure (p) modes decrease. In contrast, the amplitudes of the corresponding pseudo-modes with frequencies above the acoustic cut-off frequency increase in the intensity power spectra but are suppressed in the velocity spectra. The local helioseismology ring-diagram analysis of the simulation data further demonstrates anisotropic broadening of the modes and distinct differences in background noise and pseudo-mode structure between the intensity and velocity data. These results indicate that the center-to-limb effects arise from both geometric projection and physical factors such as line-formation height and potential effects of the radial differential rotation. The findings provide a framework for correcting helioseismic observations and demonstrate that realistic 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations are a powerful tool for disentangling geometric and physical biases in solar data.",

MARVEL combines a fast path for straightforward queries with a more deliberate DeepSearch mode that integrates retrieval-augmented generation and Monte Carlo Tree Search. It explores complementary subqueries, allocates more compute to promising branches, and maintains a global evidence ledger that preserves sources during drafting. We applied this framework in the context of gravitational-wave research related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Answers are grounded in a curated semantic index of research literature, doctoral theses, LIGO documents, and long-running detector electronic logbooks, with targeted web searches when appropriate. Because direct benchmarking against commercial LLMs cannot be performed on private data, we evaluated MARVEL on two publicly available surrogate datasets that capture comparable semantic and technical characteristics. On these benchmarks, MARVEL matches a GPT-4o mini baseline on literature-centric queries and substantially outperforms it on detector-operations content, where domain retrieval and guided reasoning are decisive. By making the complete framework and evaluation datasets openly available, we aim to provide a reproducible foundation for developing domain-specific scientific assistants.",

As a simple but representative setup, we consider conformal scalar, Weyl fermion, and Maxwell fields that provide the background radiation, and we ask whether the resulting damping and phase shift of gravitational waves retain any memory of their spins. We revisit this question in a real-time quantum-field-theoretic framework, where the stress tensor splits into a background part, a dynamical (history-dependent) response, and local contact terms, with an additional on-shell projection fixed by the Friedmann equation. We find that the dynamical spin-dependent response arises on a short time scale characterized by the radiation temperature, which is exactly canceled by the local responses. As a result, the remaining long-time response is universal and consistent with kinetic theory in the hard thermal limit. Although the underlying mechanism exhibits strong spin dependence, it leaves no observable imprint on the large-scale effective dynamics of gravitational waves in this setup.",

The archival photometric data includes images taken over 22 years and 3 months using different optical telescopes, providing an excellent time baseline to investigate light curves of variable stars. Using Lomb-Scargle periodogram, we derived accurate periods for 29 fundamental-mode (RRab) and 35 first-overtone (RRc) RRLs. Template-fitting to phase-folded light curves provided robust mean magnitudes and amplitudes. The refined periods confirm M53 as an Oosterhoff II cluster, with a mean period of 0.649 days for RRab and 0.346 days for RRc, and a high RRc fraction (54.7\\%). Most RRLs align with the horizontal branch in the color-magnitude diagram, while a few outliers result from blending effects. Period-amplitude diagrams show RRab stars following the Oosterhoff II locus. We derived I-band period-luminosity and multi-band period-Wesenheit relations, comparing them with theoretical predictions. A weighted mean distance modulus of 16.242 $\\pm$ 0.05 mag yields a cluster distance of 17.717 $\\pm$ 0.408 kpc, in agreement with recent estimates based on parallaxes from Gaia data.",

At radio frequencies, Sco X-1 is highly luminous and has been observed to have jet ejecta moving at mildly relativistic velocities away from a radio core, which corresponds to the binary position. In this Letter, we present new radio observations of Sco X-1 taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Using a fast imaging method, we find that the 10 and 15GHz data show a number of flares. We interpret these flares as the possible launching of fast jets ($\\beta\\Gamma$>2), previously observed in Sco X-1 and called ultra-relativistic flows, and their interaction with slower moving jet ejecta. Using the period between successive flares, we find that it is possible for the fast jets to remain undetected, as a result of the fast jet velocity being sufficiently high to cause the jet emission to be beamed in the direction of the motion and out of our line of sight. Our findings demonstrate that the ultra-relativistic flows could be explained by the presence of fast jets in the Sco X-1 system.",

In the context of general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) under a weak-field limit in Kerr spacetime, we present a set of preliminary results by numerically calculating the physical property of GRHD flows (e.g. kinematics and density distribution) in an effort to simulate redshifted absorption line spectra. Our model demonstrates that such GRHD accretion off the equatorial plane (i.e. $v \\gsim 0.1c$ where $c$ is the speed of light in the vicinity of AGN closer than $\\sim 100$ \\sw radii) can manifest itself as UFIs in the form of redshifted absorption signature assuming the observed characteristics such as column density of $N_H \\sim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and ionization parameter of $\\log (\\xi \\rm{[erg~cm~s^{-1}])} \\sim 3$ as also seen in recent multi-epoch {\\it NuSTAR} observations among other data.",

        "abstract": "Near the 10 solar radius perihelion of Parker Solar Probe orbit 24, a confined region containing an enhanced plasma density of 25,000 particles per cubic centimeter and broadband electrostatic waves was encountered. The solar wind velocity of 200 kilometers per second and ion temperature of 25 eV were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. These anomalous plasma conditions were observed on closed magnetic field lines, as determined from observations of the suprathermal electron strahl. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed through the base of a pseudo-streamer whose structure extended out to 10 solar radii. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. The current associated with this electric field was less than one milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. It also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations divided by density as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the generalized ohm's law was significant. Also, the density as a function of time had a non-zero slope when the electric field was non-zero, suggesting that the pressure gradient term also mattered. As compared to earlier remote sensing and theoretical results, it is surprising that the plasma in this pseudo-streamer had a remarkably low flow velocity and that the pseudo-streamer base extended out to 10 solar radii.",

The magnetic field and velocity fluctuations are extremely well correlated in a way corresponding to Alfv\\'enic fluctuations propagating away from the Sun. For a background field which is nearly radial this causes an outwardly propagating jet to form. Switchbacks and their characteristic velocity jets have recently been observed to be nearly ubiquitous by Parker Solar Probe with in situ measurements in the inner heliosphere within 0.3 AU. Their prevalence, substantial energy content, and potentially fundamental role in the dynamics of the outer corona and solar wind motivate the significant research efforts into their understanding. Here we review the in situ measurements of these structures (primarily by Parker Solar Probe). We discuss how they are identified and measured, and present an overview of the primary observational properties of these structures, both in terms of individual switchbacks and their collective arrangement into ``patches''. We identify both properties for which there is a strong consensus and those that have limited or qualified support and require further investigation.

        "abstract": "Pulsars are the most numerous class of Galactic gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Young pulsars occasionally experience sudden timing discontinuities called glitches, characterized by rapid changes in rotational parameters, usually followed by a return to regular rotation. PSR J2021+4026 is unique among Fermi-LAT pulsars, exhibiting quasiperiodic switches between two states with varying spin-down rates approximately every 3-4 years, correlated with sudden changes in gamma-ray emission features. This study searched for gamma-ray emission variability in pulsars correlated with glitch occurrence. We introduced a novel approach to analyzing LAT gamma-ray pulsars through systematic examination of variability associated with spin-down rate changes. We tracked rotation and gamma-ray emission changes for seven promising glitches selected based on observed spin-down rate variations. Using 14 years of Fermi-LAT data, we conducted binned likelihood spectral analysis of data windows around selected glitch epochs. We improved best-fit parameter precision by incorporating likelihood weights calculated from diffuse background models, accounting for systematic error contributions. The phase-averaged flux and spectral parameters of analyzed pulsars showed no significant variation across investigated glitches. The 95% upper limits on relative flux change indicate the Vela pulsar flux is unchanging, with a 0.5% upper limit on relative change, making it promising for further searches. The connection between glitch dynamics and gamma-ray emission remains unclear, and PSR J2021+4026 remains unique in its gamma-ray variability properties. We conclude that comprehensive investigation of glitches is warranted to further unravel their underlying mechanisms.",

Our analysis reveals that the characteristic frequencies of the humps increase with energy up to $\\sim30$ keV, followed by a plateau at higher energies. The fractional rms amplitudes of the humps increase with energy, reaching approximately 15\\% in the 50-100 keV band. The lag spectrum of the hump is characterized primarily by a soft lag that varies with energy. Our results suggest that the high-frequency humps originate from a corona close to the black hole.

        "title": "Stellar-mass black holes on the millimetre fundamental plane of black hole accretion",
        "abstract": "Recent work revealed the existence of a galaxy \"millimetre fundamental plane of black hole accretion\", a tight correlation between nuclear $1$mm luminosity, intrinsic $2$ - $10$keV X-ray luminosity and supermassive black hole mass, originally discovered for nearby low- and high-luminosity active galactic nuclei. Here we use mm and X-ray data of $5$ X-ray binaries (XRBs) to demonstrate that these stellar-mass black holes also lie on the mm fundamental plane, as they do at radio wavelengths. One source for which we have multi-epoch observations shows evidence of deviations from the plane after a state change, suggesting that the plane only applies to XRBs in the hard state, as is true again at radio wavelengths. We show that both advection-dominated accretion flows and compact jet models predict the existence of the plane across the entire range of black hole masses, although these models vary in their ability to accurately predict the XRB black hole masses.",

        "title": "Modelling spacecraft-emitted electrons measured by SWA-EAS experiment on board Solar Orbiter mission",
        "abstract": "Thermal electron measurements in space plasmas typically suffer at low energies from spacecraft emissions of photo- and secondary electrons and from charging of the spacecraft body. We examine these effects by use of numerical simulations in the context of electron measurements acquired by the Electron Analyser System (SWA-EAS) on board the Solar Orbiter mission. We employed the Spacecraft Plasma Interaction Software to model the interaction of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft with solar wind plasma and we implemented a virtual detector to simulate the measured electron energy spectra as observed in situ by the SWA-EAS experiment. Numerical simulations were set according to the measured plasma conditions at 0.3~AU. We derived the simulated electron energy spectra as detected by the virtual SWA-EAS experiment for different electron populations and compared these with both the initial plasma conditions and the corresponding real SWA-EAS data samples. We found qualitative agreement between the simulated and real data observed in situ by the SWA-EAS detector. Contrary to other space missions, the contamination by cold electrons emitted from the spacecraft is seen well above the spacecraft potential energy threshold. A detailed analysis of the simulated electron energy spectra demonstrates that contamination above the threshold is a result of cold electron fluxes emitted from distant spacecraft surfaces. The relative position of the break in the simulated spectrum with respect to the spacecraft potential slightly deviates from that in the real observations. This may indicate that the real potential of the SWA-EAS detector with respect to ambient plasma differs from the spacecraft potential value measured on board. The overall contamination is shown to be composed of emissions from a number of different sources and their relative contribution varies with the ambient plasma conditions.",

Using HST/COS spectroscopy of two AGN sightlines passing through the Sextans B CGM at small impact parameters of 4 kpc and 8 kpc (0.04 and 0.08 r_vir), we detect the CGM in Si II, Si III, Si IV, and C II absorption. All four ions show a column-density profile that declines with radius. The profiles fall below the average CGM profiles of other nearby dwarfs (by 0.3-0.6 dex, depending on ion), likely due to the low halo mass and low metallicity of Sextans B. Using Cloudy photoionization models and interferometric measurements of the H I column density, we find low gas-phase silicon and carbon abundances in the Sextans B CGM, [Si/H]=-1.7+/-0.2 and [C/H]=-2.1+/-0.2, among the lowest gas-phase abundances anywhere in the Local Group. We calculate a cool CGM gas mass within 8 kpc of $\\sim8\\times10^8 M_\\odot$, making the CGM the dominant baryon reservoir of the galaxy, ~20 times larger than both the H I mass and the stellar mass.",

If the white dwarf is rich enough in ${}^{22}\\mathrm{Ne}$, these crystallized solids are buoyant and rapidly rise, efficiently liberating potential energy which may halt the cooling of the white dwarf or power magnetic phenomena. Although this ${}^{22}\\mathrm{Ne}$ distillation process may explain the cooling anomaly in Q-branch white dwarfs and anomalous emission lines in DAHe white dwarfs, its operation demands unusually high ${}^{22}\\mathrm{Ne}$ abundances not generically predicted by isolated stellar evolution. We show that the engulfments of helium white dwarfs by both main-sequence and red giant stars can result in carbon--oxygen white dwarfs with ${}^{22}\\mathrm{Ne}$ abundances high enough to distill ${}^{22}\\mathrm{Ne}$. This enhancement occurs because carbon dredged up following an especially energetic and off-center helium flash can be processed into ${}^{22}\\mathrm{Ne}$ by subsequent hydrogen shell burning and helium shell burning. ${}^{22}\\mathrm{Ne}$-distilling white dwarfs from these merger channels are predicted to be somewhat more massive than typical white dwarfs (up to $\\simeq0.7M_\\odot$) and may have anomalous rotation rates, consistent with DAHe white dwarfs.

We propose a mechanism in which non-annihilating dark matter (DM) with non-gravitational interactions with the Standard Model (SM) particles accumulates inside Population III (Pop III) stars, inducing their premature collapse into BH seeds having the same mass as the parent star. Owing to their early formation, these seeds can accrete for longer periods and grow into the SMBHs observed at early cosmic times. Focusing on spin-dependent (SD) DM-proton interactions, we identify regions of parameter space that account for the observed high-redshift SMBH population, their mass function, and the SMBH-stellar mass relation. Portions of this parameter space are testable by forthcoming direct detection experiments. The scenario may lead to distinctive gravitational wave (GW) signatures from SMBH mergers, accessible to Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and pulsar timing array (PTA) observations.",

        "abstract": "JWST surveys have uncovered a population of compact, red sources (\"Little Red Dots,\" LRDs) at $z \\ge 5$ that exhibit broad Balmer emission yet remain X-ray faint, implying heavy obscuration with $N_H \\ge 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. We propose that LRDs may trace a short-lived, obscured phase associated with rapid baryonic inflow inside the deep solitonic cores of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos. Combining the soliton size scaling with (i) the observed compact radii ($r_e \\sim 30-100$ pc) and (ii) the requirement that Compton-thick columns be achievable within a region of order the core radius, we find that particle masses $m$ few $\\times 10^{-22}$ eV are plausible for soliton masses $M_s \\sim 10^8 - 10^9 M_\\odot$; we adopt $m_{22}=2$ as a fiducial choice. A conservative mass-budget estimate for the obscuring column, together with isothermal hydrostatic stratification, indicates that configurations reaching $N_H \\ge 10^{24} - 10^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$ require densities for which radiative losses (cooling and/or diffusion) occur faster than the dynamical time, suggesting that a long-lived static hot atmosphere is unlikely (an \"Opacity Crisis\") and that rapid inflow or radiation-pressure-driven evolution is favored. Using $512^3$ pseudo-spectral Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson simulations of idealized soliton mergers, we illustrate that compact, high-density soliton cores can form via violent relaxation under representative scalings. We discuss observational implications and tests, and outline the need for future radiation-hydrodynamic modeling to predict demographics and detailed spectra.",

We use HST F814W and JWST F200W photometry to select stars as RSGs based on predicted colors and magnitudes from PARSEC isochrones. The spatial distribution of our recovered RSGs follow the familiar pattern of mostly being concentrated in active star-forming regions such as spiral arms and central starburst rings. The RSG number density on kpc-scales is strongly correlated ($r_s$$\\sim$0.82) with local star-formation rate density ($\\Sigma_{SFR}$) traced by extinction-corrected far-ultraviolet (FUV) from GALEX+WISE, and weakly correlated ($r_s$$\\sim$0.57) with the total stellar mass density ($\\Sigma_*$), traced by near-infrared emission from WISE+Spitzer.

LoRA is an established technique for large language models that adds adapter networks to adjust model weights and biases to efficiently fine-tune large base models without retraining. We train a base model using a photometric redshift ground truth dataset, which contains broad galaxy types but is less accurate. We then fine-tune using LoRA on a spectroscopic redshift ground truth dataset. These redshifts are more accurate but limited to bright galaxies and take orders of magnitude more time to obtain, so are less available for large surveys. Ideally, the combination of the two datasets would yield more accurate models that generalize well. The LoRA model performs better than a traditional transfer learning method, with $\\sim2.5\\times$ less bias and $\\sim$2.2$\\times$ less scatter. Retraining the model on a combined dataset yields a model that generalizes better than LoRA but at a cost of greater computation time. Our work shows that LoRA is useful for fine-tuning regression models in astrophysics by providing a middle ground between full retraining and no retraining. LoRA shows potential in allowing us to leverage existing pretrained astrophysical models, especially for data sparse tasks.",

The oncoming era of large surveys and advances in computational modeling create the potential to reach breakthroughs in our understanding.

They therefore serve as excellent tracers for the local physical and chemical properties of these environments. Proper models that are capable of grasping the formation and destruction of COMs are crucial to understanding observations. However, given that distinct COMs may be detected from different locations and at varying times, we improve UCLCHEM - a gas-grain chemical code - to a one-dimensional, time-dependent model, tailored to protostars. In this update, we examine two stages of a protostar: the prestellar and heating stages, incorporating a simple radiative mechanism for both the internal and external radiation fields of the cloud. This approach relies on the key assumption that the dust and gas temperatures are completely coupled. Ultimately, we implement an updated version of our model to interpret observations obtained through both single-dish and interferometry under varying conditions, including a SgrB2(N1) hot core, massive Galactic clumps and a hot core in Orion. We show that our model could reproduce these observations well, highlighting that some COMs are positioned at a higher temperature in the envelope, whereas others are from the lower temperature, potentially leading to misinterpretation when using a single-point model. In a particular case of SgrB2(N1), the best model indicates that the cosmic-ray ionisation rate significantly exceeds the value typically used for the standard interstellar medium. Our model shows as an efficient computational tool particularly useful for better insights into observations of COMs.",

We study the velocity-dependent p-wave annihilation case, whose resulting energy injection can modify the thermal and ionization history of the Universe, leaving observable imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum and the global 21-cm signal. From the predicted energy injection into the plasma, we derive stringent upper limits on the fraction of dark matter in form of PBHs for p-wave annihilation models, based on the observational constraints of the CMB spectral distortions ($y$-type), and from the measurement of the 21-cm absorption signal at cosmic dawn.

Using SPARC data [1], we demonstrate that this model consistently achieves high fidelity fits, often outperforming MOND and CDM halo models in RMSE and R-squared metrics without parametric tuning. The method is reproducible, minimally dependent on mass modeling, and offers a streamlined alternative for characterizing galactic dynamics. While the velocity correction {\\omega} lacks a definitive physical interpretation, its empirical success invites further exploration. We position this model as a local kinematic tool rather than a cosmological framework, and we welcome dialogue on its implications for galactic structure and gravitational theory.

        "abstract": "The nature of dark energy (DE) remains elusive, even though it constitutes the dominant energy-density component of the Universe and drives the late-time acceleration of cosmic expansion. By combining measurements of the expansion history from baryon acoustic oscillations, supernova surveys, and cosmic microwave background data, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Collaboration has inferred that the DE equation of state may evolve over time. The profound implications of a time-variable, ``dynamical\" DE (DDE) that departs from a cosmological constant motivate the need for independent observational tests. In this work, we use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation to investigate how DDE affects the properties of the Lyman-Alpha ``forest'' of absorption features produced by neutral hydrogen in the cosmic web. We find that DDE models consistent with the DESI constraints induce a spectral tilt in the forest transmitted flux power spectrum, imprinting a scale- and redshift-dependent signature relative to standard Lambda-CDM cosmologies. These models also yield higher intergalactic medium temperatures and reduced Lyman-Alpha opacity compared to Lambda-CDM. We discuss the observational implications of these trends as potential avenues for independent confirmation of DDE.",

        "abstract": "We present a spectroscopic characterization of 580 K dwarfs within 33 pc, observed with the CHIRON echelle spectrograph (R=80,000) on the SMARTS 1.5m telescope. This volume-limited sample is part of the RKSTAR survey of $\\sim$4400 K dwarf primaries within 50 pc. Using Empirical SpecMatch and the diagnostic lines H-alpha (6562.8 Angstrom) and Li I (6707.8 Angstrom), we derive stellar properties, activity status, and age indicators calibrated against 35 benchmark K dwarfs with ages from 20 Myr to 5 Gyr. We find that 7.4% (43 stars) exhibit signatures of youth and/or chromospheric activity: 19 stars show lithium absorption indicating ages $<$1 Gyr, and 36 display H$\\alpha$ emission. Kinematic analysis using BANYAN $\\Sigma$ identifies 8 additional young stars through membership in the AB Doradus moving group and the Hyades cluster, bringing the total young/active population to 8.8% (51 stars). Stellar parameters span 3600--5500 K in \\teff, $-$0.60 to $+$0.55 dex in [Fe/H], and $$25 km s$^{-1}$ in $v\\sin i$. A metal-poor population ([Fe/H] $\\leq -$0.50 dex) comprises 4\\% of the sample. Galactic kinematics place 80% in the thin disk and 18.4% in the thick disk, with one halo member (HD 134439). Young and active stars are predominantly thin disk members, with two thick disk exceptions. Cross-matching with NASA's Exoplanet Archive reveals only 7.5% (44 stars) host confirmed planets as of July 2025. Our results identify 529 mature, inactive K dwarfs as prime targets for terrestrial planet searches, providing a crucial resource for exoplanet habitability studies in the solar neighborhood.",

        "abstract": "Common-envelope evolution (CEE) is among the most uncertain phases in binary evolution. To empirically constrain CEE, we construct a uniformly selected sample of eclipsing post--common-envelope binaries (PCEBs). Starting from an unresolved white dwarf-main-sequence (WDMS) candidate sample within 200 pc selected from the Gaia color-magnitude diagram, we identify 39 detached eclipsing WDMS binaries using ZTF light curves. The binaries contain cool M dwarfs orbiting warm white dwarfs with orbital periods ($P_{\\rm orb}$) of 0.1-2 d. The sample's simple selection function allows us to model observational incompleteness and infer intrinsic properties of the PCEB population. We find an orbital-period distribution consistent with being log-uniform over 0.1-2 d, contrary to recent reports of a bimodal distribution. The companion-mass distribution peaks around $0.25~{\\rm M_\\odot}$ and declines steeply toward larger masses. The estimated local space density is $7.2\\times10^{-5}~{\\rm pc^{-3}}$, corresponding to a Galaxy-wide birth rate of 0.01 per year. Combining our results with recent Gaia-based constraints on wider WDMS binaries, we construct an empirical period distribution of post-interaction WDMS binaries spanning 0.1-1000 d. The emerging period distribution is roughly log-flat (d$N/{\\rm d}\\log P_{\\rm orb}\\propto P_{\\rm orb}^0$) at $P_{\\rm orb} < 2$ d and log-increasing (d$N/{\\rm d}\\log P_{\\rm orb}\\propto P_{\\rm orb}^1$) at $P_{\\rm orb} = 100-1000$ d. The 10-100 d regime remains poorly constrained, but a few nearby systems suggest it is also well-populated. Short-period PCEBs ($P_{\\rm orb}<2$ d) with M dwarf companions are roughly 2-3 times more common than wide ($P_{\\rm orb} = 100-1000$ d) WDMS binaries with FGK companions, which likely formed through stable mass transfer. These results provide direct observational constraints on CEE and an empirical benchmark for binary-population models.",

        "abstract": "Since the launch of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in late 2021, our understanding of high-redshift objects has faced several upheavals. JWST has discovered much more massive galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBH) than cosmological models had expected. Furthermore, JWST observations have revealed an entirely novel population of high-redshift objects. Characterized by a dominant red rest-frame component and point-like morphology, these ``little red dots'' (LRD) have set off a flurry of observational and theoretical follow-up. The current identity of LRD is highly debated, yet falling into two main scenarios: active galactic nuclei (i.e., SMBH) or compact star-forming regions. If star-forming, LRD would represent the highest stellar densities ever observed. If SMBH, their high Eddington fractions, and already high masses, help elucidate the growth of the most massive SMBH found by JWST in the early Universe ($z \\gtrsim4)$. In this mini-review, we present the observational evidence accumulated to date, including sub-millimeter probes of LRD dust masses, constraints on radio and X-ray emission from stacking, and rest-frame ultraviolet \\& optical measurements provided by JWST. Furthermore, we highlight how identifying additional LRD that are truly primarily SMBH-driven may help to shed light on the formation of `overly massive' SMBH discovered by JWST within the first billion years since the Big Bang.",

        "abstract": "The High Latitude Imaging Survey (HLIS) of NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will provide powerful tests of cosmological models through sensitive measurements of cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL), and galaxy clustering. As part of the HLIS Project Infrastructure Team's Data Challenge 1 (DC1), we carry out Fisher forecasts of cosmological parameter constraints from combinations of these probes, focusing on inverse-variance figures of merit (FoMs) for the parameters $\\sigma_8$ and $\\Omega_{\\rm{m}}$, which scale the amplitude of weak lensing signals. We find good agreement between Fisher analysis and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis of the DC1 baseline data vector, and we exploit the flexibility of Fisher analysis to investigate varied priors on cosmological parameters and on nuisance parameters describing unknown biases in photometric redshifts or shear measurements. Given the benchmark DC1 priors, the forecast constraints from GGL+clustering are substantially stronger than those from cosmic shear, with the combination of all three probes (``$3\\!\\times\\!2$pt'') providing moderate further improvement. Adding tight external priors on the power spectrum shape parameters $n_{\\rm{s}}$, $\\Omega_{\\rm{b}}$, and $h_0$ can improve the $(\\sigma_8, \\Omega_{\\rm{m}})$ FoMs by factors of $1.2$--$3.5$. The smallest scale angular bins provide much more information than the largest scale bins, and the highest redshift tomographic bins provide more information than the lowest redshift bins. Factor-of-two changes in the priors on photo-$z$ and shear biases, relative to the benchmark values based on anticipated calibration accuracy, produce changes of $\\lesssim 20\\%$ in FoMs, implying robust cosmological performance if this demanding level of accuracy can be achieved.",

The event was caused by an object with 0.219^{+0.075}_{-0.046} Jupiter masses that is either gravitationally unbound or on a very wide orbit. Through comparison with the statistical properties of other observed microlensing events and predictions from simulations, we infer that this object likely formed in a protoplanetary disk (like a planet), not in isolation (like a brown dwarf), and dynamical processes then ejected it from its birth place, producing a free-floating object.",

        "abstract": "X-ray selected surveys of clusters of galaxies have been reported to contain more regular cool core clusters compared to samples selected using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. Morphology population studies on X-ray selected clusters will be biased without taking into account selection, as cool cores are more easily detected at low redshifts, but can be mistaken for point sources at high redshift. eROSITA, aboard SRG, found over 12000 optically-identified clusters in its first survey, eRASS1. Taking account of the selection function obtained from simulations, we obtain using a Bayesian framework the intrinsic distribution of morphological parameters, including the concentration, central density, cuspiness, ellipticity and slosh. We construct scaling relations for the parameters as a function of redshift (z) and luminosity (LX), and study their distribution within z or LX bins. We find that the concentration in a scaled aperture evolves positively with LX, similarly to the central scaled density, and negatively with z. When using a fixed aperture, its evolution with LX is lower, but also dependent on the choice of cluster centre. The mean ellipticity does not significantly evolve with z or LX. eRASS1 clusters show indications of higher concentrations compared to SZ-selected objects, even after taking account the selection; this suggests that if our X-ray selection model is correct SZ-selected clusters may also suffer from morphological selection effects. We compare different parameter distribution models in bins of z and LX. The distribution of concentration and ellipticity is generally consistent with a normal one, but other parameters such as the central density and cuspiness strongly favour more complex distributions. However, modelling of all clusters as a single population generally prefers non-normal distributions. [abridged]",

Simultaneous line profile modeling of [Ca II] and [O I] at nebular phases shows that an asymmetric core-collapse explosion of a low-mass ($\\lesssim$3.3 $M_{\\odot}$) He-core progenitor can explain the observed line profiles. Alternatively, lack of local star formation at the site of the SN explosion combined with a low ejecta mass is also consistent with a thermonuclear explosion due to a low-mass hybrid He-C/O white dwarf + C/O white dwarf merger.",

Further, we aim to establish to what extent the measured total unsigned magnetic field traces other activity indicators. We measured the total unsigned magnetic field on four young, stars using Zeeman splitting of magnetically sensitive spectral lines from high-resolution spectra obtained with the spectropolarimeters ESPaDOnS at CFHT and NARVAL at TBL. We then characterised the magnetic field variations using both sinusoidal variation and Lomb-Scargle periodograms. We evaluated how the rotational variation of the total unsigned magnetic field strength correlates with the activity indicators S-index, H$\\alpha$-index, Ca IRT-index, and the large-scale magnetic field obtained from ZDI maps obtained in earlier studies. We find clear signals of rotational modulation of the total magnetic field on HIP 76768 and tentative detection on Mel 25-5. This is supported both by the sinusoidal fitting and the periodogram. For the other stars, we find no modulation signals of the total magnetic field. We find positive correlations between the total magnetic field and activity indices on all four stars, indicating that indirect magnetic activity indicators trace the underlying magnetic field variability. However, comparing the activity-magnetic field relationship between the stars in our sample shows a significant deviation between activity level and measured magnetic field strength. Small-scale magnetic field variability can be traced using the Zeeman effect on magnetically sensitive lines, provided that the star is sufficiently active. It is also possible to self-consistently recover rotational periods from such measurements. The primary limit for the detection of magnetic field variations is the precision of Zeeman broadening and intensification measurements.",

        "abstract": "We present a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the Hubble constant within the framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), focusing on the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model and its dynamical dark energy extensions described by the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, both with and without massive neutrinos. By embedding the cosmological background equations directly into a Bayesian PINN architecture, we reconstruct the Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ in a data-driven yet physically consistent manner, while rigorously propagating epistemic uncertainties. Our analysis combines late-time observational probes, including Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO DESI DR2), and the Pantheon supernova sample, and quantifies the resulting tension in the inferred Hubble constant with respect to Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background constraints and the SH0ES (R22) local distance ladder measurement. Within $\\Lambda$CDM, we find that data combinations involving BAO tend to favor lower values of $H_0$, alleviating the tension with Planck at the expense of increased disagreement with SH0ES. Allowing for a time-evolving dark energy equation of state in the CPL framework systematically shifts the posterior of $H_0$ toward higher values, leading to a notable reduction of the SH0ES tension, particularly for combinations including supernova data. The most flexible scenario, CPL with a free total neutrino mass $\\Sigma m_\\nu$, yields a balanced reconciliation between early- and late-Universe determinations of $H_0$, with tension levels typically reduced to the $\\sim1$-$2\\sigma$ range relative to both Planck and SH0ES. Our results highlight the nontrivial interplay between dark energy dynamics and neutrino mass in addressing the Hubble tension and demonstrate the efficacy of Bayesian PINNs as a robust and versatile tool for precision cosmology beyond the standard paradigm.",

We show that a radiatively compact turbulent corona generates extended nonthermal ion distributions, while producing X-ray spectra consistent with observations. As an example, we demonstrate excellent agreement with observed X-ray spectra of NGC 4151. The predicted emission spectra feature an MeV tail, which can be studied with future MeV-band instruments. The MeV tail is shaped by nonthermal electrons accelerated at turbulent current sheets. We also find that the corona regulates itself into a two-temperature state, with ions much hotter than electrons. The ions carry away roughly 60% to 70% of the dissipated power, and their energization is driven by a combination of shocks and reconnecting current sheets, embedded into the turbulent flow.",

In contrast to standard leptogenesis via freeze-in, our mechanism works even in the presence of a single RHN around the GeV scale.

Here we explain this difference by identifying the physical mechanism that regulates flare temperatures on late M-dwarfs. The key factor is that in the cool, dense atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1, magnetic heating is strongly moderated by the dissociation of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) into atomic hydrogen. This \"H$_2$ dissociation thermostat\" acts as an efficient energy sink, preventing flare regions from heating above ${\\sim}4000$\\,K. Our chemical equilibrium and heat capacity calculations show that this effect depends sensitively on stellar atmospheric pressure and the local abundance of H$_2$. In hotter stars, from early M dwarfs to solar-type stars, the scarcity of molecular hydrogen renders this mechanism ineffective; instead, atomic hydrogen ionization limits flare temperatures near ${\\sim}$9000\\,K.",

We develop an analytic model of line emission, demonstrating that relativistic beaming results in a broadened, power-law spectral feature with photon index -1. We then perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations incorporating electron-positron pair production, annihilation, and Compton scattering. The dependence of the emergent spectrum on the baryon loading is also examined, showing that a baryon-poor fireball is more favorable for the detection of MeV gamma rays. We further assess the detectability of the line component. The simulation results indicate that a power-law MeV component from the initial spike of a Galactic MGFs could be observed with current instruments, such as Fermi/GBM, and will be well within the reach of upcoming MeV gamma-ray satellites, which are expected to detect O(100) photons from such events.",

We found that the AGN fraction decreases as a function of void-centric distance, with void galaxies displaying the highest AGN fraction (12\\%), and galaxies in denser environments, showing the lowest AGN fraction (6.7\\%), consistent with observations. The AGN fraction is particularly high in most massive void galaxies when controlling for stellar mass.   When comparing AGN host galaxies to inactive ones, we find that AGN galaxies tend to have slightly more massive SMBHs, higher specific star formation rates, and reside in higher-mass haloes at a given stellar mass than non-AGN galaxies. At $\\rm M_{*} > \\rm 10^{10.2} \\rm M_{\\odot}$, AGN hosts in voids tend to have slightly more massive SMBHs than those in denser environments. Otherwise, the AGN population does not show a clear trend in relation to the global environment. In contrast, non-AGN void galaxies host more massive SMBHs, slightly higher sSFRs, and are located in more massive haloes than those in denser environments. Analysing the recent merger histories of both AGN and non-AGN populations, we find that a larger fraction of massive AGN galaxies have undergone major mergers compared to non-AGN galaxies, regardless of environment. Notably, AGN galaxies in voids show a higher frequency of recent mergers, especially major mergers, than their counterparts in other environments, especially at high stellar mass.   Our results suggest that the evolution of SMBHs in voids is closely related to that of their host galaxies and their surrounding environment, while the most recent AGN activity is more strongly linked to recent interactions.",

In this study, we investigated the variability of the torus by analyzing temporal asymmetry in the mid-infrared (MIR) continuum. We compared ensemble structure functions between the brightening and dimming phases for AGNs at $0.15<0.4$, using monitoring data in the optical from the Zwicky Transient Facility and in the MIR from the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We found that AGNs with bluer optical-to-MIR colors exhibit positive temporal asymmetry in the MIR, indicating that their variability amplitude is larger when brightening. Conversely, those with redder colors show negative asymmetry, exhibiting larger variability amplitude when decaying. However, there is no significant temporal asymmetry in the $g$-band variability driven by the accretion disk, suggesting that the temporal asymmetry in the MIR continuum primarily originates from intrinsic processes in the torus instead of the reflection of the ultraviolet-optical variability from the accretion disk. Analysis of the composite light curves revealed that AGNs with bluer optical-to-MIR colors tend to brighten gradually in the MIR, leading to the observed temporal asymmetry. This finding suggests that hot-dust-rich AGNs evolve with a gradual decline in hot dust emission, while hot-dust-poor AGNs are associated with a steady increase.",

        "title": "Betelgeuse: Detection of the Expanding Wake of the Companion Star",
        "abstract": "Recent analyses conclude that Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star (HD 39801), likely has a companion object with a period of about 2000 days orbiting at only 2.3 stellar radii, deep in the chromosphere of the supergiant. A probable detection of such a companion, named Siwarha, has just occurred from speckle imaging. This study finds that Betelgeuse spectra in the optical region and ultraviolet exhibit signatures of variable circumstellar absorption and chromospheric outflows. These variations are consistent with the ~ 2000-day period of the companion object. Circumstellar absorption evident in optical Mn I lines, and mass outflow marked by ultraviolet Fe II, Si I, and Mg I lines increase after the transit of the companion across the disk of Betelgeuse. Following the eclipse of the companion, the absorption and outflow slowly decrease in advance of the next transit. The occurrence and variation of this plasma appear consistent with the presence of a trailing and expanding wake caused by a companion star orbiting within the atmosphere of Betelgeuse.",

        "abstract": "Higher-order perturbations during the ringdown phase are essential for testing gravitational theories. This requires a perturbation framework that extends beyond General Relativity, as well as an appropriate method for reconstructing the spacetime metric. In this work, we address these challenges within the context of general spherically symmetric spacetimes. We introduce a modified Teukolsky equation for perturbative calculations in asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric spacetimes. The metric reconstruction method, which does not rely on the Hertz potential, is extended to $tr$-symmetric spacetime, allowing for the calculation of metric components under specific gauge conditions. Additionally, we present a second-order perturbation theory applicable to generic spherically symmetric spacetimes.",

General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models of M87* and its accretion disk predict that the amplitude and location of the ring's peak brightness asymmetry should fluctuate due to turbulence in the source plasma. We compare the observed distribution of brightness asymmetry amplitudes to the simulated distribution in GRMHD models, across varying black hole spin $a_{*}$. We show that, for strongly magnetized (MAD) models, three epochs of EHT data marginally disfavor $|a_{*}| \\lesssim 0.2$. This is consistent with the Blandford-Znajek model for M87's jet, which predicts that M87* should have nonzero spin. We show quantitatively how future observations could improve spin constraints, and discuss how improved spin constraints could distinguish between differing jet-launching mechanisms and black hole growth scenarios.",

        "abstract": "The stochastic gravitational wave background is a broadband target from diverse astrophysical and cosmological sources. The background falls within the mHz frequency band could become a potential observable for future space-based interferometers. Taiji, a proposed space mission slated for launch in the 2030s, will enable the study of such a background. However, the unique characteristics of space missions pose distinctive challenges for separating the stochastic background from instrumental noise. To address the data analysis requirements, we develop a preliminary pipeline to search for the SGWB and evaluate its performance with Taiji simulation datasets. At present, we demonstrate that the algorithm can successfully recover the parameters of injected background with a known spectral density after setting aside the complication of galactic binaries foreground. Furthermore, by employing the trans-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we extend the analysis to reconstruct the background with unknown spectral morphology.",

        "abstract": "The Hubble tension is commonly framed as a discrepancy between local, late-time measurements favoring $H_0 \\approx 73$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and early-time, Sound-Horizon-based measurements favoring $H_0 \\approx 67$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We challenge this viewpoint by analyzing 83 Sound-Horizon-independent $H_0$ measurements, categorized into four classes: Distance Ladder measurements using local calibrators; Local One-Step $\\Lambda$CDM measurements assuming the standard expansion history; Pure Local One-Step measurements independent of $H(z)$ shape; and CMB Sound Horizon free measurements using CMB data without the Sound Horizon scale. We find that the 29 Distance Ladder measurements yield $H_0 = 72.74 \\pm 0.40$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\\chi^2_\\nu \\equiv \\chi^2/d.o.f= 0.74$), while the 54 One-Step measurements collectively yield $H_0 = 68.67 \\pm 0.46$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\\chi^2_\\nu = 0.85$), a $6.7\\sigma$ tension exceeding the Planck--SH0ES discrepancy. This tension remains significant at $4.5\\sigma$ after accounting for correlations. Among One-Step categories, Local One-Step $\\Lambda$CDM measurements favor the lowest value ($H_0 = 67.18 \\pm 0.90$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), Pure Local One-Step yield an intermediate value ($H_0 = 70.38 \\pm 1.00$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), and CMB Sound Horizon Free measurements give $H_0 = 68.71 \\pm 0.63$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Thus, that the Hubble tension is better characterized as a discrepancy between the Distance Ladder and all other methodologies, rather than an early-vs-late-time split. We also identify a $2.4\\sigma$ internal tension among One-Step measurements: analyses assuming $\\Lambda$CDM systematically recover lower $H_0$ values by about 3.2 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ compared to model-independent methods. This suggests either unrecognized systematics/physics in the Distance Ladder or deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM in the late-time Universe.",

In these models, the particles running in the loop are distinguished from the standard model due to an imposed $\\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry under which the loop particles are odd. Therefore, the lightest particle running in the loop can be a viable dark matter candidate. In this paper, we revisit the minimal scotogenic neutrino mass model and study the anatomy of right handed neutrino (RHN) DM relic, taking into account contributions from self-annihilation, co-annihilation, conversion-driven processes, as well as production via the freeze-in mechanism. We impose the constraints from direct detection and collider searches of DM including anomalous magnetic moment of muon, charged lepton flavor violation and low-energy neutrino oscillation data to show that the lightest RHN can be a viable DM in the mass range: $M_{h}/2\\lesssim M_{\\rm DM}\\lesssim2000 {\\rm GeV}$ (thermal DM) and $0.1 ~{\\rm GeV}\\lesssim M_{\\rm DM}\\lesssim 1000 {\\rm GeV}$ (non-thermal DM), where $M_h$ denotes the Standard Model Higgs mass and $M_{\\rm DM}$ is the RHN dark matter mass.

Such progenitor environments present complex physical conditions that are challenging to model by numerical simulations. The difficulty increases when solving the accretion process and propagation of the outflows, as it requires covering distances from the black hole horizon to beyond the progenitor star. General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations provide a convenient framework to study high-luminosity jets, where magnetic flux plays an important role in the process of jet launching from the central engine. To follow the propagation of the jet through and beyond its progenitor environment, we use multi-scale simulations (i.e., AMR-based). In this work, we report results of 2.5-dimensional GRMHD simulations of a lGRB progenitor.

NGC 1365 is known for rapid transitions between Compton-thick and Compton-thin states, along with strong absorption from a highly ionized wind. During our observations, the source is found in a persistent low-flux state, characterized by a decrease in hard-X-ray luminosity and significant line-of-sight obscuration. In this state, XRISM/Resolve reveals clear Fe\\,\\textsc{xxv} and Fe\\,\\textsc{xxvi} absorption lines together with, for the first time in this source, corresponding emission lines. These features may arise either from reemission from a photoionized wind (P Cygni profile) or from collisionally ionized gas associated with outflow-driven shocks in the interstellar medium. We estimate the wind launch radius to be approximately $10^{16}~\\mathrm{cm}$ ($\\sim 10^4 R_{\\mathrm{g}}$), consistent with the location of the X-ray broad-line region. We also resolve a broadened Fe K$\\alpha$ line by $\\sigma \\sim 1300$ km s$^{-1}$ placing it at similar scales to the wind, consistent with radii inferred from disk-broadening models and the variability of the Fe K$\\alpha$ broad line. The similarity of the Fe K$\\alpha$ profile to the H$\\beta$ wing and broad Pa$\\alpha$ width indicates that the X-ray-emitting region is likely cospatial with the optical/IR broad-line region and originates from the same gas.",

However, this does not fully explain the existence of low-mass CBs with   masses in the range of 1-1.5 solar masses. It is noted that there exists a   population of low-mass binaries, nearly filling their Roche lobes. Their   overall properties suggest that they could be progenitors of low-mass   CBs.",

The stability of such very low mass ratio systems is still debated. Based on our review of systems within the mass ratio cutoff range, we reanalyzed TYC 3801-1529-1 and found it to have the lowest known mass ratio, q=0.024_{-(1)}^{+(2)}, among analyzed contact binaries. The reanalysis of this target was carried out using the BSN application and the MCMC method. We then compared our light curve solution obtained from TESS observations with the results of a previous study. We studied the period variations of this system and identified a cyclic trend over the past six years. After the third-body contribution has been removed, the system's period variations can be described either by a linear trend with a negative slope or by a quadratic trend with a downward curvature. These results indicate that it is still not possible to definitively determine whether the orbital period is increasing or decreasing, underscoring the importance of future observations. By considering the challenges of detecting the faint secondary in extremely low mass ratio systems, we estimated the absolute parameters of the target. Based on our analysis, the secondary component of the binary is likely a brown dwarf, while the third body appears to be a low-mass M-type dwarf. According to our analysis, TYC 3801-1529-1 is dynamically unstable and thus represents a remarkable candidate for a binary merger.",

The static and evolving (based on the semi-analytical cosmological model of Gomez et al. (2010) and Hagi et al. (2015)) potentials of the Galaxy are considered both in the form of an axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric potential of the Galaxy with a rotating elongated bar with the following parameters at the present time: mass $10^{10} M_\\odot$, length of the major semi-axis 5 kpc, rotation angle of the bar axis 25$^o$, angular velocity of rotation 40 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ . To form the 6D-phase space required for integrating the orbits, the most accurate astrometric data to date from the Gaia satellite (Vasiliev \\& Baumgardt, 2021), as well as new refined average distances (Baumgardt \\& Vasiliev, 2021) were used. We used a frequency method for analysis of the chaotic/regular orbital motion of all 45 GCs. The results are summarized in the table, which provides an overview of each GC in our sample, the degree of chaotization in both the static and evolving potentials, and the influence of the central rotating bar on the degree of orbital chaotization in both cases. It is shown that the orbital dynamics have undergone minor changes during the transition from the static to the evolving potential. This confirms our previously obtained result that changes in the masses and sizes of the gravitational potential components act on orbital parameters in opposite ways, and at small galactocentric distances this influence is maximally compensated, while the orbits of distant objects and objects with large apocentric distances experience the greatest influence.",

Fast radio bursts are short and intense pulses of coherent radio emission. Their large dispersion measures support an extragalactic origin. While their exact origin still remains elusive, a substantial number of models associates them with strong magnetic field and high-energy relativistic plasma found in the vicinity of magnetars. There is growing evidence that some fast radio bursts are associated to flare-type events from magnetars. We aim to provide a set of configurations describing a relativistic, spherical, mass-loaded, magnetic explosion. We proceed by solving the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, for a system that expands while maintaining its internal equilibrium. We employ a semi-analytical approach for the solution of the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. We assume self-similarity in time and radius, axial symmetry, and separation of variables. There exists a dichotomy of solutions that correspond to higher and lower density and thermal pressure compared to the external one. The ratio of the poloidal to toroidal field and the inclusion of pressure and mass density affect the expansion velocity. The classes of these solutions can be applied to magnetar giant flares and fast radio bursts. The ones corresponding to overdensities and higher pressure can be associated to magnetar flares, whereas the ones corresponding to underdensities can be relevant to fast radio bursts corresponding to magnetically dominated events with low mass loading.",

We discuss the destructive excitation of QNMs and the stability of the ringdown near and at the EL. The transient linear growth of QNMs -- a characteristic excitation pattern near an EP or EL -- together with the conditions under which this linear growth dominates the early ringdown, is also studied analytically.

A representative sample of local and distant field galaxies was studied using bar detection techniques based on elliptical isophotes and Fourier decomposition. The analysis focuses on the dependence of bar formation on stellar mass, color index, and bulge-to-total ratio (B/T). In the local universe, the bar fraction increases with stellar mass and is higher in red, more evolved galaxies, suggesting that disk stability plays a fundamental role in bar formation. In contrast, distant galaxies exhibit a significantly lower bar fraction, indicating that dynamically unstable disks in earlier cosmic epochs limited both the formation and persistence of bars. Bars are more frequent in galaxies with disk-dominated structures (low B/T) at all redshifts; however, even these systems show a reduced bar fraction at higher redshift. Overall, the results highlight the importance of disk stabilization in driving the morphological evolution of galaxies across cosmic time.",

Their radiation hardness and capability to reconstruct energy deposits with unprecedented precision make them a promising technology for space-based X-ray astronomy. In this scenario, optical and near-infrared photons may saturate the sensor, distorting the reconstructed signal. We present a light-tight shield for skipper-CCDs to suppress optical backgrounds while preserving X-ray detection efficiency. We deposited thin aluminum layers on the CCD surface using an e-beam evaporator and evaluated their blinding performance across wavelengths from 650 to 1000 nm using a monochromator, as well as the X-ray transmission using an $^{55}$Fe source. We find that 50 and 100\\,nm layers provide >99.6\\% light suppression, with no efficiency loss for 5.9 and 6.4\\,keV X-rays. In addition, we used Geant4 simulations to extend these results to a broader energy range and quantify the efficiency loss for different aluminum thicknesses. Results show that thin aluminum coatings are an effective, low-cost solution for optical suppression in skipper-CCDs intended for X-ray detection and space instrumentation.",

In this paper, we propose ASCNet, an innovative model specifically designed for classifying nighttime ASC images collected at the Muztagh-ata site from 2022 March to 2024 June. ASCNet integrates ResNet34 with an ASCModule, which employs Depthwise Dilated Convolution and embeds lightweight Squeeze-and-Excitation attention within its branches to extract fine-grained texture information from the luminance channel. The data set is partitioned by category, with 70% of images assigned to the training set and 30% to the test set. The model's performance is assessed by comparing its predictions on the test set with manually annotated labels, yielding a consistency rate of 92.7%. All evaluation metrics of ASCNet are as follows: Accuracy 92.66%, Precision 83.26%, Recall 84.25%, and F1-Score 83.67%, and both ablation and comparative experiments demonstrate significant superiority over other models. A confusion matrix is utilized to analyze the differences between manual classification and model classification. The statistical results demonstrate the model's excellent classification performance and its robust generalization ability, illustrating that ASCNet has potential for application in future astronomical image classifications.",

We identified this comet to be the minor planet (139359) 2001 ME1 whose previously unnoticed dust activity near perihelion became optically amplified by efficient forward scattering of sunlight as the comet crossed between the Sun and SOHO/Earth at up to 175.6 deg phase angle. Simultaneous backscattering observations by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) precisely constrain the comet's ~7 mag forward scattering brightening, enabling a direct comparison with the ~3 mag brightening of the more active but optically dust-poor comet 2P/Encke seen by SOHO and STEREO under similar geometry in 2017. Earlier STEREO observations from 2014 additionally show the newly recognized activity to be recurrent -- consistent with a reanalysis of the comet's associated meteor activity -- and has likely only been previously overlooked due to the comet's faintness and proximity to the Sun while active. Orbital integrations show the comet has likely followed a near-Earth orbit for at least the past 10 kyr, suggesting that the weakness of its observed activity evolved through its continued depletion of accessible volatiles.",

        "abstract": "Our Sun is the closest X-ray astrophysical source to Earth. As such, it makes a formidable case study to better understand astrophysical processes. Solar flares are in particular very interesting as they are linked to coronal mass ejections as well as magnetic field reconnection sites in the solar atmosphere. Flares can therefore provide insightful information on the physical processes at play on their production sites, but also on the emission and acceleration of energetic charged particles towards our planet, making it a formidable forecasting tool for space weather. While solar flares are critical to understanding magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration, their hard X-ray polarization -- key to distinguishing between competing theoretical models -- remains poorly constrained by existing observations. To address this, we present the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP), a mission under development to perform solar flare polarimetry in the 25-100 keV energy range. CUSP consists of a 6U-XL platform hosting a dual-phase Compton polarimeter. The polarimeter is made of a central assembly of four 4x4 arrays of plastic scintillators, each coupled to multi-anode photomultiplier tubes, surrounded by four strips of eight elongated GAGG scintillator bars coupled to avalanche photodiodes. Both types of sensors from Hamamatsu are respectively read out by the MAROC-3A and SKIROC-2A ASICs from Weeroc. In this manuscript, we present the preliminary spectral performances of single plastic and GAGG channels measured in the laboratory using development boards of the ASICs foreseen for the flight model.",

        "abstract": "Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays are primarily estimated to arise from high-energy electromagnetic interactions in pulsars and their halo through electron inverse Compton (IC) scattering. Hadronic channels like neutral pion decay have also been proposed to produce TeV-PeV gamma rays from the Pulsar halo. The neutral pions are expected to be generated from cosmic ray (CR) protons interacting with the ambient/cloud. The recent observations of sub-PeV gamma rays from the halo of pulsar PSR J0622+3749 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory Kilometre-Square Array (LHAASO-KM2A) detector provide a platform to explore different channels of their production. Previous studies support consistency with the leptonic modeling of the halo, which attributes its origin to slow diffusion in the interstellar medium. In this work, we investigated the possibility of proton-proton channel as the origin of these photons. To explain the observed gamma rays with energy $\\sim 4$ TeV by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) telescope till 200 TeV by the LHAASO observatory, one requires the CR proton luminosity to be $\\eta_p\\sim 0.1$ of the pulsar PSR J0622+3749 spin-down luminosity. In this case, we have considered the protons propagating in a one-zone superdiffusion environment, specifically $\\alpha = 1$ in a cloud of gas density 1 per cm$^{3}$.",

        "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has introduced a new class of radio frequency interference (RFI) that poses a fundamental challenge to modern radio astronomy. In particular, unintended electromagnetic radiation emitted by satellite electronics exhibits strong temporal variability and weak spectral regularity, limiting the effectiveness of conventional mitigation techniques that rely on long term averaging or multi epoch observations. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits of low rank interference mitigation in the single epoch regime, where only a single time frequency snapshot is available. We formulate satellite induced interference as a structured but non stationary component superposed on astrophysical signals and thermal noise, and analyze the conditions under which low rank decomposition can successfully suppress interference while preserving underlying astronomical information. Through controlled simulations and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that aggressive rank truncation can lead to substantial signal distortion, particularly for diffuse or low signal to noise astrophysical features. We quantify this trade off using preservation and suppression metrics, and show that beyond a critical interference strength, low rank methods inevitably induce irreversible information loss. Our results clarify the operational boundaries of low rank approaches for next generation radio observations and highlight the need for interference aware, data driven mitigation strategies tailored to the single epoch regime.",

        "abstract": "We present the MEGATRON suite of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations following the formation of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the earliest cosmic epochs when Population III stars form to Cosmic Noon. The suite represents the first set of cosmological simulations that couples a vast non-equilibrium thermochemistry network of primordial species, metals, and molecules to multifrequency, on-the-fly radiation transport, allowing us to directly predict the spectral properties of early galaxies. By initializing the simulations at zero metallicity, resolving haloes well below the atomic cooling threshold, reaching parsec-scale resolution, and modeling a Milky Way-mass environment, we aim to address four key science themes: 1) Star formation at cosmic dawn, 2) Galaxy formation and the interstellar medium in the epoch of reionization, 3) The circumgalactic medium towards cosmic noon, and 4) Reionization in a local volume environment and near-field cosmology. In this introductory work, we present an overview of the physical characteristics of high-redshift MEGATRON galaxies and their environment at $z>8$. We present a library of $>175,000$ simulated galaxy spectra and demonstrate how the diversity of galaxy spectra seen by JWST is naturally reproduced in the context of a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This project represents a step towards making more direct comparisons between simulations and observations and will enable future work to both optimize methods for inferring galaxy properties from observations and to elucidate the physics that governs galaxy formation in the early Universe.",

These simulations model galaxy formation up to $z\\approx8$ in a region that will collapse into a Milky-Way-like galaxy at $z=0$, while self-consistently tracking Population III and II (Pop.~III, Pop.~II) star formation, feedback and chemical enrichment.

We analyze the correlation of star-formation rate vs. stellar mass (the star-forming main sequence, SFMS) for our sample and find no significant difference between the intrinsic scatter in the H$\\alpha$-based SFMS and the UV-continuum-based SFMS. However, the diagnostic power of the SFMS is limited at high redshift and low stellar mass due to observational biases that exclude faint, quenched galaxies. To more directly probe star-formation variability, we examine the dust-corrected H$\\alpha$-to-UV ratio, which is assumed to trace deviations a from constant SFH over the past $\\sim100$ Myr. In our sample, $73^{+4}_{-4}$% of galaxies exhibit H$\\alpha$-to-UV ratios inconsistent with a constant SFH. We do not observe any statistically significant evolution in the H$\\alpha$-to-UV ratio with redshift. Additionally, lower-mass galaxies ($7\\leq\\text{log}(M_*/M_{\\odot})<8.5$) are $30 \\pm 1$% more likely to lie above this equilibrium range -- indicative of a recent ($\\lesssim 100$ Myr) burst of star formation -- compared to higher-mass systems ($8.5\\leq\\text{log}(M_*/M_{\\odot})\\leq10.9$). These results suggest that bursty SFHs are more common in low-mass galaxies at $z\\sim 1$-$7$ and that this remains relatively stable across $\\sim0.8$-$6$ Gyr after the Big Bang.",

        "abstract": "We present three cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic zoom simulations of the progenitor of a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the MEGATRON suite. The simulations combine on-the-fly radiative transfer with a detailed non-equilibrium thermochemical network (81 ions and molecules), resolving the cold and warm gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) on spatial scales down to 20 pc and on average 200 pc at cosmic noon. Comparing our full non-equilibrium calculation with local radiation to traditional post-processed photoionization equilibrium (PIE) models assuming a uniform UV background (UVB), we find that non-equilibrium physics and local radiation fields fundamentally impact the thermochemistry of the CGM. Recombination lags and local radiation anisotropy shift ions away from their PIE+UVB values and modify covering fractions (for example, HI damped Ly$\\alpha$ absorbers differ by up to 40%). In addition, a resolution study with cooling-length refinement allows us to double the resolution in the cold and warm CGM gas, reaching 120 pc on average. When refining on cooling length, the mass of the lightest cold clumps decreases tenfold to $\\approx 10^4\\,M_\\odot$, their boundary layers develop sharper ion stratification, and the warm gas is better resolved, boosting the abundance of warm gas tracers such as CIV and OIII. Together, these results demonstrate that non-equilibrium thermochemistry coupled to radiative transfer, combined with physically motivated resolution criteria, is essential to predict circumgalactic absorption and emission signatures and to guide the design of targeted observations with existing and upcoming facilities.",

Both simulations are run with the high-resolution, hydrodynamical LYRA galaxy formation model, allowing us to explore the global and substructure properties of the dwarf in a consistent context. While the overall halo growth, final mass, and subhalo mass functions remain largely unchanged across models, SIDM produces a central dark matter core extending to $\\sim$1 kpc, which does not significantly vary with the inclusion of baryons. Baryonic properties, however, differ notably. The SIDM model leads to a 25% reduction in stellar mass and retains more gas within the stellar half-mass radius due to a prolonged quiescent phase in star formation. The stellar distribution is less centrally concentrated, and a population of in-situ star clusters form at late times. Substructure analysis reveals fewer luminous satellites and more stellar-only systems in SIDM, driven in part by tidal stripping that affects the dark matter more than the stars. A subset of satellites undergoes tidal-triggered core collapse after infall, enhancing the diversity of SIDM satellite rotation curves. These differences offer potential observational signatures of SIDM in low-mass galaxies.",

        "abstract": "It has been proposed that the stellar cores observed in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies reflect underlying dark matter (DM) cores that cannot be formed by stellar feedback acting on collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) halos. Assuming this claim is correct, we investigate the constraints that arise if such cores are produced by self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We derive the range of SIDM cross-sections (sigma/m) required to reproduce the observed core sizes. These can result from halos in either the core-formation phase (low sigma/m) or the core-collapse phase (high sigma/m), yielding a wide allowed range (sim 0.3 -- 200 cm2/g) consistent with values reported in the literature for more massive galaxies. We also construct a simple model relating stellar mass to core radius - two observables likely connected in SIDM. This model reproduces the stellar core sizes and masses in UFDs with sigma/m consistent with those derived above. It also predicts a trend of increasing core radius with stellar mass, in agreement with observations of more massive dwarf galaxies. The model central DM densities match observations when assuming the SIDM profile to originate from an initial CDM halo that follows the mass-concentration relation. Since stellar feedback is insufficient to form cores in these galaxies, UFDs unbiasedly anchor sigma/m at low velocities. If the core-collapse scenario holds (i.e., high sigma/m), UFD halos are thermalized on kpc scales, approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the stellar cores. These large thermalization scales could potentially influence substructure formation in more massive systems.",

        "abstract": "Star clusters host the massive stars responsible for feedback in star-forming galaxies. Stellar feedback shapes the interstellar medium (ISM), affecting the formation of future star clusters. To self-consistently capture the interplay between feedback and star formation, a model must resolve the parsec-scale star formation sites and the multiphase ISM. Additionally, the dynamical impact of cosmic rays (CRs) on star formation rates (SFRs) must also be considered. We present the first simulations of the formation of an ensemble of star clusters with dynamically-coupled CRs, near-individual star particles, and a feedback-regulated ISM. We analyze tallbox simulations performed using the CRISP model in the moving-mesh code AREPO. We apply varied implementations of CR transport under the theory of self-confinement. We find that CRs simultaneously reduce the SFR, the power law slope of the cluster mass function, and the cluster formation efficiency. Each simulation is compatible with observations, and CR feedback tends to move results along observed star cluster relations. We see only modest changes in cluster radius and velocity dispersions, but significant differences in the virial parameters. Ultimately, the primary impact of CRs is to reduce SFRs. Lower SFRs imply fewer supernovae, and consequently a lower turbulent energy budget for gas. Star clusters formed in a CR-regulated ISM have lower velocity dispersions, and are therefore more bound under self-gravity. The effective clustering of SNe is unchanged by CRs. Through this work, we demonstrate the predictive power of the CRISP feedback model, despite this idealized setup.",

In the first few Myr, mechanical feedback is dominated by collective effects of the massive stellar winds in the YMC. The mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities of these stars change by orders of magnitude over pre-SN timescales as the massive stars evolve, and mass-loss rates of Cool Supergiant (CSG) stars in particular are uncertain by a factor $\\sim~20$ or more. In this work we perform a first study of the time evolution of average cluster wind velocity $\\bar{V}_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ as a function of stellar metallicity $Z$, assuming single star evolution. We also check the validity of assuming Wolf-Rayet stars dominate the feedback effects of a YMC, as often done when interpreting X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray observations, and test how sensitive $\\bar{V}_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ is to current uncertainties in mass-loss rates.

        "abstract": "The mildly non-linear regime of cosmic structure formation holds much of the information that upcoming large-scale structure surveys aim to exploit, making fast and accurate predictions on these scales essential. We present the $N$-body module of DISCO-DJ (DIfferentiable Simulations for COsmology - Done with Jax), designed to deliver high-fidelity, GPU-accelerated, and differentiable particle-mesh simulations tailored for cosmological inference. Theory-informed time integrators such as the recently introduced BullFrog method allow for accurate predictions already with few time steps (e.g. $6$ steps for per-cent-level accuracy in terms of the present-day power spectrum at $k \\approx 0.2 \\, h / \\mathrm{Mpc}$ using $N = 512^3$ particles, which takes just a few seconds). To control discreteness effects and achieve high accuracy, the code incorporates a suite of advanced techniques, for example a custom non-uniform FFT implementation for force evaluation. Both forward- and reverse-mode differentiation are supported, with memory requirements independent of the number of time steps; in the reverse case, this is achieved through an adjoint formulation. We extensively study the effect of various numerical parameters on the accuracy. As an application of DISCO-DJ, we perform field-level inference by recovering $\\sigma_8$ and the initial conditions from a noisy Gadget matter density field. Coupled with our recently introduced Einstein--Boltzmann solver, the DISCO-DJ ecosystem provides a self-consistent, fully differentiable pipeline for modelling the large-scale structure of the universe.

        "abstract": "The black-hole occupation fraction ($f_\\mathrm{occ}$) defines the fraction of galaxies that harbor central massive black holes (MBHs), irrespective of their accretion activity level. While it is widely accepted that $f_\\mathrm{occ}$ is nearly 100% in local massive galaxies with stellar masses $M_\\star \\gtrsim 10^{10}~M_\\odot$, it is not yet clear whether MBHs are ubiquitous in less-massive galaxies. In this work, we present new constraints on $f_\\mathrm{occ}$ based on over 20 years of Chandra imaging data for 1606 galaxies within 50 Mpc. We employ a Bayesian model to simultaneously constrain $f_\\mathrm{occ}$ and the specific accretion-rate distribution function, $p(\\lambda)$, where the specific accretion rate is defined as $\\lambda=L_\\mathrm{X}/M_\\star$, and $L_\\mathrm{X}$ is the MBH accretion luminosity in the 2-10 keV range. Notably, we find that $p(\\lambda)$ peaks around $10^{28}~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}~M_\\odot^{-1}$; above this value, $p(\\lambda)$ decreases with increasing $\\lambda$, following a power-law that smoothly connects with the probability distribution of bona-fide active galactic nuclei. We also find that the occupation fraction decreases dramatically with decreasing $M_\\star$: in high mass galaxies ($M_\\star \\approx 10^{11-12}M_\\odot$), the occupation fraction is $>93\\%$ (a $2\\sigma$ lower limit), and then declines to $66_{-7}^{+8}\\%$ ($1\\sigma$ errors) between $M_\\star\\approx10^{9-10}M_\\odot$, and to $33_{-9}^{+13}\\%$ in the dwarf galaxy regime between $M_\\star\\approx10^{8-9}~M_\\odot$.

We apply NLTE corrections to enhance the reliability of abundance measurements, which significantly reduces the discrepancies in abundances between observations and theoretical yields for odd-Z elements, such as Na and Al. Our Bayesian framework also enables the incorporation of explodability and effectively mitigates biases introduced by varying resolutions across different supernova model grids. In addition to confirming a top-heavy ($\\alpha=0.54$) initial mass function for massive Pop III stars, we derive a robust mass--energy relation ($E\\propto M^2$) of the first supernovae.

Recent studies found that these modes could couple at the core-to-envelope interface with pure inertial modes in their sub-inertial regime, forming the so-called inertial dip in the period-spacing pattern of these stars. The inertial dip, as formed by core modes, stands out as a unique probe of core properties. We aim in this work to explore the effect of core magnetism on its structure, property of key relevance in modern stellar physics. We describe the outlines of our model and the geometry of the considered field. We give the coupling equation and the variation of the dip shape and location with increasing magnetic contrast between the core and the envelope. We compare our findings to the ones obtained in a hydrodynamical, differentially-rotating case. We show hints at potentially lifting the degeneracy between the signatures of core-to-envelope differential rotation and core magnetic fields. Together, these two cases can be considered as an exploration of different magnetic regimes potentially reached in the core of gamma Dor stars.",

Using direct-method oxygen abundances, we find a complex metallicity profile that generally declines with distance, decreasing by 0.37 dex from the galaxy center out to 2.4 kpc into the outflow. This implies a metal-loading factor roughly an order of magnitude lower than predictions based on the mass-metallicity relation for low-mass galaxies.

No H$\\beta$ emission is detected associated with the broad redshifted component, implying extremely high HeII/H$\\beta$ ratios (0.7--4.8).

A distinct transition from the photospheric to the radioactive tail phase in the $V$ band--as is common in hydrogen-rich Type II SNe--is not visible in SN 2021tsz, although a modest $\\sim$1 mag drop is apparent in the redder filters. Hydrodynamic modelling suggests the luminosity is powered by ejecta-circumstellar material (CSM) interaction during the early phases (<30 days). Interaction with 0.6 M$_\\odot$ of dense CSM extending to 3100 R$_\\odot$ reproduces the observed luminosity, with an explosion energy of 1.3$\\times$10$^{51}$ erg.

We identify 40 galaxies across six quasar fields, residing in 15 overdensities within 300 kpc of the background sightlines. Five OI absorption systems are associated with five of these overdensities, yielding a covering fraction of $0.27^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$ within 300 kpc. The absorption occurs beyond typical virial radii, indicating that the gas traces extended overdensity environments rather than individual galaxy halos, unlike the z~0 CGM which is largely bound to halos. These galaxy-associated absorbers account for $\\sim35\\%$ of all OI systems seen in blind quasar surveys, implying the remainder arise in lower-mass galaxies below our detection threshold or in dense neutral IGM pockets. The CGM around these galaxies contains $\\gtrsim 2\\times10^6~M_{\\odot}$ of oxygen, comparable to the ISM oxygen mass of the galaxies themselves, suggesting that the surrounding environment holds as much metal mass as the galaxies. All five galaxy-associated systems show significantly higher $\\log(N_{\\rm CII}/N_{\\rm OI})$ ratios than absorbers lacking galaxy associations. Furthermore, relative abundance ratios ([Si/O], [C/O]) reveal that four of the five exhibit enrichment patterns consistent with Population III nucleosynthesis.

Also, the existence of an unusual size--mass relation has been claimed. These observations are only partially reproduced by current models, and the physics responsible for the observed relations is still under debate. We expect to unveil the formation channels of the observed compact galaxies. We analyse 7605 snapshots for 169 galaxies of the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suite FirstLight.   We find that galaxies undergo an expansion--compaction--re-expansion process. This process operates in a specific mass range; compaction starts at $\\log (M^\\star_ {\\rm on} / {\\rm M}_\\odot) \\sim 8.5$ and ends at $\\log (M^\\star_{\\rm off} / \\mathrm{M}_\\odot) \\sim 9.5$. In between these masses, the size--mass relation becomes inverted, with a negative slope. The physical mechanism driving this process in our simulations involves a self-reinforced inflow of gas from the outer regions, that triggers a strong, localised starburst at the centre (within $1\\, {\\rm kpc}$). This contraction continues until conditions favour star formation in a broader area, and the normal inside-out growth pattern resumes. We present evidence for the existence of a universal wet compaction operating at Cosmic Dawn. This mechanism is driven by spherical accretion triggered by the change of the state of the central matter of galaxies, from dark matter- to baryon-dominated. We also propose an analytical expression for the infall process, suitable for use in semi-analytic models.

Due to their complexity and non-linear nature, it can be challenging to understand their decision-making process. While these models can effectively identify unusual spectra, interpreting the physical nature of the flagged outliers remains a major challenge. We aim to bridge the gap between anomaly detection and physical understanding by combining deep learning with interpretable ML (iML) techniques to identify and explain anomalous galaxy spectra from SDSS data. We present a flexible framework that uses a variational autoencoder to compute multiple anomaly scores, including physically-motivated variants of the mean squared error. We adapt the iML LIME algorithm to spectroscopic data, systematically explore segmentation and perturbation strategies, and compute explanation weights that identify the features most responsible for each detection. To uncover population-level trends, we normalize the LIME weights and apply clustering to the top 1\\% most anomalous spectra. Our approach successfully separates instrumental artifacts from physically meaningful outliers and groups anomalous spectra into astrophysically coherent categories. These include dusty, metal-rich starbursts; chemically-enriched H\\,II regions with moderate excitation; and extreme emission-line galaxies with low metallicity and hard ionizing spectra. The explanation weights align with established emission-line diagnostics, enabling a physically-grounded taxonomy of spectroscopic anomalies. Our work shows that interpretable anomaly detection provides a scalable, transparent, and physically meaningful approach to exploring large spectroscopic datasets.

We investigate compact and massive galaxies (CMGs) using the TNG50 cosmological simulation, applying uniform selection criteria matching observational surveys at $z=0$, $z=0.3$, and $z=0.7$, enabling direct comparisons with observed compact galaxies. CMGs are classified according to their stellar mass assembly histories to examine how compactness relates to dynamical properties and chemical enrichment across cosmic time. Our results show that simulated CMGs follow the observed mass-size relation, with the number of objects increasing at higher redshifts, in line with observational trends. Dynamically, while observations suggest relic galaxies are outliers in the stellar mass-velocity dispersion plane, simulated compacts show relatively uniform velocity dispersions across different accretion histories. Observed relics are more metal-rich than other compact galaxies with extended star formation, deviating from the local mass-metallicity relation. In contrast, simulated CMGs are overall more metal-rich than the quiescent population, regardless of accretion history. The deviation from the mass-metallicity relation decreases with redshift. These results suggest that the extreme characteristics of CMGs in TNG50, particularly in metallicity and dynamics, are less pronounced than in observed relics. Nonetheless, these results offer a theoretical framework to assess the properties of such extreme objects from different epochs, highlighting both alignment with and deviations between the models.",

        "abstract": "The era of real-time cosmology has begun. It is now possible to directly measure the apparent drift of high-redshift astronomical sources across the sky $\\textit{in real time}$. This so-called $\\textit{position drift}$ provides a valuable probe of the peculiar velocity field and cosmic structure formation by giving direct access to the transverse velocity that is otherwise currently not measurable and must be statistically reconstructed from the density field in a model-dependent way. To fully exploit this new window into the Universe, it is essential to understand how cosmological structures affect position drift measurements. Here we present the first position drift study based on the general relativistic N-body simulation code $\\texttt{gevolution}$. We calculate the position drift directly from the past light cone for ten different observers and compare the results to predictions from linear perturbation theory. At linear order, the position drift is directly proportional to the transverse velocity on the sky. This linear approximation reproduces our non-linear simulation results to within about 5%. We calculate power spectra for the position drift, splitting the signal into an E- and B-mode and compare the former to linear expectations, finding good agreement. The B-mode is suppressed on linear scales, but has similar amplitude as the E-mode on non-linear scales. We further demonstrate that light-cone inhomogeneities induce biases in the dipole of the drift, introducing redshift dependence of both the amplitude and direction. Although our analysis is not yet sufficient for a firm conclusion, our results suggest that these effects alone cannot explain the possible redshift-dependent dipole in Gaia DR3 data reported in the literature.",

Moreover, non-SF galaxies (composite, Seyfert, and LINER) displayed discrepancies among SFR tracers, particularly for LINER galaxies, with offsets below 0.86 dex and a scatter of 0.57 dex. Additionally, our findings revealed robust correlations between SFRs and specific SFRs (sSFRs) with Eddington ratios. Eddington ratio exhibited gradual transitions in the (s)SFRs-stellar mass diagrams. Galaxies with high Eddington ratios displayed high star formation activity, similar to blue SF galaxies. Furthermore, we observed decreasing sSFR trends from SF galaxies to composite, Seyfert, and LINER galaxies.

Examples of this source separation task include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source. Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution. The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors, evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as real-world galaxy observations.",

Our full numerical simulation follows the final 40 orbits of the inspiral and merger of the binary, following an initial phase of 165 orbits of CBD evolution toward equilibrium. We find that the jets, launched from the minidisks surrounding each black hole, are tilted toward the black hole spin direction close to the individual black holes, but align with the binary's total angular momentum at larger distances. Following the merger, the remnant black hole receives a recoil kick exceeding 1000 km/s. Remarkably, it retains its gravitationally bound CBD as if it were ejected from a galactic nucleus. Furthermore, the jet launched by the recoiling remnant black hole preserves the large-scale orientation established during the late inspiral. We demonstrate that the majority of the luminosity emerges from a region in close proximity to the black hole, suggesting that the accretion disk surrounding the recoiling remnant would remain the most luminous feature postmerger, persisting for long enough to be observable by modern telescopes (hours in the case of LISA sources). These findings introduce a direct, first-principles model for the recoil of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), offering a comprehensive theoretical basis to support and elucidate both ongoing and future observational efforts.",

        "abstract": "Complex energy transfer processes in the intracluster medium (ICM) can revive fossil (with spectral ages $\\gg100$ Myr) plasma initially generated by radio galaxies. This leads to the re-ignition of faint radio sources with irregular and filamentary morphologies, and ultra-steep ($\\alpha \\gtrsim 1.5$) synchrotron spectra, which can be more easily detected at low frequencies ($\\sim 100$ MHz). These sources offer the opportunity to investigate the microphysics of the ICM and its interplay with radio galaxies, the origin of seed relativistic electrons, the merging history of the host cluster, and the phenomenology of radio filaments. The study of revived sources has so far been hampered by the requirement of sensitive and high-resolution multi-frequency radio data at low frequencies to characterise their spatial properties and provide a proper classification. We aim to perform the analysis of a sample of candidate revived sources identified among nearby ($z\\leq0.35$) and low-mass ($M_{500}\\leq5\\times 10^{14} M_\\odot$) \\textit{Planck} clusters in the footprint of LoTSS-DR2. By inspecting LoTSS-DR2 images at 144 MHz, we identified 7 targets with patchy and filamentary morphologies, which have been followed-up with the uGMRT at 400 MHz. By combining LOFAR and uGMRT data, we obtained high-resolution images and spectral index maps, which we used to interpret the nature of the sources. All targets show regions with very steep spectra, confirming the effectiveness of our morphology-based selection in identifying fossil plasma. Based on their morphology, spectral properties, and optical associations, we investigated the origin of the targets. We found a variety of promising revived fossil sources, while also showing that apparently intricate structures can be easily misclassified in the absence of high-resolution and multi-band data.",

The traditional evaluation criterion $\\xi_{2.5}$ $=$ 0.45, primarily established using non-rotating progenitor models, suffers from significant inaccuracies when applied to rotating pre-supernova systems. The effects of metallicity and rotation on the explodability landscapes of massive stars lack robust quantification. We aim to investigate how rotation and metallicity influence the explodability of massive stars. We investigate how rotation and metallicity affect stellar explodability using MESA simulations with initial rotational velocities of $0$, $300$, and $600~\\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$ at three metallicities ($Z_{\\odot}$, $1/10,Z_{\\odot}$, $1/50,Z_{\\odot}$).

Chemically homogeneous evolution in rapidly rotating low-metallicity stars significantly raises the compactness limit for successful explosions and narrows the zero-age main sequence mass range for failed supernovae. Rotation substantially affects the explodability of low-metallicity massive stars, underscoring the importance of incorporating rotational effects in models of core-collapse supernova progenitors.",

Although their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data. Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce StarEmbed, the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves''). We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source detection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI, Chronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular, TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source detection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time series data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm shift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised pipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the analysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.",

        "abstract": "We present a rigorous identification of candidates for dormant black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) in binaries using summary statistics from Gaia DR3, rather than full orbital solutions. Although Gaia astrometric orbits have already revealed a small sample of compact object binaries, many systems remain undetected due to stringent quality cuts imposed on the published orbits. Using a forward-modelling framework that simulates Gaia observables, in particular the renormalised unit weight error (ruwe) and radial velocity (RV) scatter, we infer posterior distributions for companion mass and orbital period via MCMC sampling, marginalising over nuisance orbital parameters. We validate our approach by comparing the predicted masses and periods against full orbit solutions from DR3, and by successfully recovering known compact object binaries as promising candidates. The method is best suited for systems with red giant primaries, which have more reliable Gaia RV scatter and a light centroid more likely dominated by one component, compared to main-sequence stars. And they are less likely to be triples with short-period inner binaries, which produce confounding signatures. We apply the method to three million giants and identify 556 systems with best-fit companion masses $\\gtrsim 3\\,M_\\odot$. Recovery simulations suggest our selection method is substantially more sensitive than the DR3 non-single-star catalogue, particularly for binaries with periods below 1 year and above $\\sim 6$ years. These candidates represent promising targets for spectroscopic follow-up and Gaia DR4 analysis to confirm the presence of compact objects. Candidate main-sequence stars with massive companions face a larger set of confounding effects. Therefore, we present an analogous catalogue of 279 additional `main sequence' candidates only as an appendix.",

SNe Ia analyses typically fit to the functional form $D_{\\rm L}(z)$ derived theoretically from the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Yet, the metric in the epoch relevant to SNe Ia measurements deviates slightly from FLRW due to gravitational clumping of mass into large-scale structures like filaments and voids, whose sizes span many orders of magnitude. The small deviation is modeled typically by scalar perturbations to the FLRW metric. Each line of sight to a SNe Ia passes through a random sequence of structures, so $D_{\\rm L}$ differs stochastically from one line of sight to the next. Here, we calculate the $D_{\\rm L}$ dispersion in an exact Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi Swiss-cheese universe with a power-law hole size distribution, as a function of the lower cut-off $R_{\\rm min}$ and logarithmic slope $\\gamma$. We find that the standard deviation of $D_{\\rm L}$ scales as $\\sigma_{D_{\\rm L}} \\propto z^{2.25\\pm0.01} (R_{\\rm min}/24\\pm1\\,{\\rm Mpc})^{(0.157\\pm0.003)\\left[\\gamma - (1.16\\pm0.02)\\right]}$ for redshifts in the range $0.5 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 2.1$.

        "abstract": "From catalogs of gravitational-wave transients, the population-level properties of their sources and the formation channels of merging compact binaries can be constrained. However, astrophysical conclusions can be biased by misspecification or misestimation of the population likelihood. Despite detection thresholds on the false-alarm rate (FAR) or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the current catalog is likely contaminated by noise transients. Further, computing the population likelihood becomes less accurate as the catalog grows. Current methods to address these challenges often scale poorly with the number of events and potentially become infeasible for future catalogs. Here, we evaluate a simple remedy: increasing the significance threshold for including events in population analyses. To determine the efficacy of this approach, we analyze simulated catalogs of up to 1600 gravitational-wave signals from black-hole mergers using full Bayesian parameter estimation with current detector sensitivities. We show that the growth in statistical uncertainty about the black-hole population, as we analyze fewer events but with higher SNR, depends on the source parameters of interest. When the SNR threshold is raised from 11 to 15 -- reducing our catalog size by two--thirds -- we find that statistical uncertainties on the mass distribution only grow by a few 10% and constraints on the spin distribution are essentially unchanged; meanwhile, uncertainties on the high-redshift cosmic merger rate more than double. Simultaneously, numerical uncertainty in the estimate of the population likelihood more than halves, allowing us to ensure unbiased inference without additional computational expense. Our results demonstrate that focusing on higher-significance events is an effective way to facilitate robust astrophysical inference with growing gravitational-wave catalogs.",

        "abstract": "Context: Most active galactic nuclei (AGN) are believed to be surrounded by a dusty molecular torus on the parsec scale which is often embedded within a larger circumnuclear disk (CND). AGN are fuelled by the inward transport of material through these structures and can launch multi-phase outflows that influence the host galaxy through AGN feedback. Aims: We use the Circinus Galaxy as a nearby laboratory to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for feeding the torus and launching a multi-phase outflow in this Seyfert-type AGN, as these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: We analysed observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of the Circinus nucleus at angular resolutions down to 13 mas (0.25 pc). We traced dust and the ionised outflow using 86-665 GHz continuum emission, and studied the morphology and kinematics of the molecular gas. Results: We find that the Circinus CND hosts molecular and dusty spiral arms, two of which connect directly to the torus. We detect inward mass transport along these structures and argue that the non-axisymmetric potential generated by these arms is the mechanism responsible for fuelling the torus. We estimate a feeding rate of 0.3-7.5 M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, implying that over 88% of the inflowing material is expelled in a multi-phase outflow before reaching the accretion disk. The inferred torus feeding time scale (120 kyr - 2.7 Myr) suggests that variability in AGN activity may be driven by changes in torus feeding. On parsec scales, the ionised outflow is traced by optically thin free-free emission. The outflow is stratified, with a slightly wider opening angle in the molecular phase than in the dusty and ionised components. The ionised outflow is launched or collimated by a warped accretion disk at a radius of r ~ 0.16 pc, and its geometry requires an anisotropic launching mechanism.",

These are vast regions of the observable universe, typically spanning scales of several hundred Mpc, that move coherently with speeds of the order of several hundred km/sec. While there is a general consensus on the direction of these motions, discrepancies persist in their reported sizes and velocities, with some of them exceeding the predictions of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. The observed large-scale peculiar-velocity fields are believed to have originated as weak peculiar-velocity perturbations soon after equipartition, which have subsequently grown by structure formation and by the increasing inhomogeneity of the post-recombination universe. However, the evolution and the implications of these bulk velocity fields remain poorly understood and they are still a matter of debate. For instance, it remains a challenge for the theoreticians to explain the high velocities measured by several bulk-flow surveys, like those recently reported using the CosmicFlows-4 data. Such extensive and fast velocity fields could have played a non-negligible role during structure formation and they might have also ``contaminated'' our observations. After all, in the history of astronomy, there are examples where relative-motion effects have led us to a serious misinterpretation of reality (shortened abstract due to length limits).",

By propagating the modelling uncertainties associated with the non-linear matter power spectrum, non-linear galaxy bias and baryon feedback, we design scale cuts to ensure that measurements of the matter density and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum are biased by less than 30% of the statistical error. We also test the internal consistency of the data and weak lensing systematics by performing new measurements of the lensing shear ratio. We demonstrate that the DESI-DR1 shear ratios can be successfully fit by the same model used to describe cosmic shear correlations, and analyse the additional information that can be extracted about the source redshift distributions and intrinsic alignment parameters.

Each camera is equipped with an HAWAII-2RG detector covered by an assembly that combines two broadband filters and a linear-variable filter, which perform the intensity mapping and absolute photometric measurements, respectively.

        "abstract": "The mid-infrared (MIR) emitting regions of the individual protoplanetary disks in the binary system Z CMa are resolved by MATISSE/VLTI. The observations were obtained during a serendipitous large outburst of the HBe star that lasted more than 100 days, while the FUor companion is presumed to be in quiescence. The size of the MIR-emitting disk region of the more massive HBe star increases toward longer wavelengths from $<14$ mas at 3.5$\\mu m$ to $\\ll 50$ mas at 11.5$\\mu m$ . The lack of substructures in the HBe disk might suggest that it is a continuous disk; however, this could be due to observational constraints. We also note a radial variation of the silicate absorption feature over the disk, where the optical depth increases inwards of $<$40~au radii. This contradicts the scenario of a carved, dusty cocoon surrounding the HBe star. In the case of the less massive FUor companion, the MIR-emitting region is much smaller with an angular size $\\leq$15 mas (or else a physical radius $<9$ au) in all bands, suggesting a compact disk. Both disks are aligned within uncertainties, and their orientation agrees with that of the known jets. Furthermore, MATISSE data place the binary's separation at $117.88 \\pm 0.73$ mas and a position angle of $139.16^o\\,\\pm\\,0.29^o$ east of north. Our estimates for the orbital elements gave an eccentric orbit ($e\\sim0.17$) with a moderate inclination ($i\\sim 66$\\degr). The derived total mass is $M_{\\rm total} = 16.4^{+2.1}_{-2.3}$ M$_\\odot$, while the period is approximately 950 years. Our MATISSE imaging of the Herbig disk during outburst indicates a temperature gradient for the disk, while imaging of the FUor companion's disk corroborates previous studies showing that FUor disks are rather compact in the MIR. We cannot infer any misalignment between the MATISSE results and earlier ALMA/JVLA data, nor can we infer any influence from the alleged flyby event.",

        "abstract": "The dominant sources of photoionizing radiation in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) incident on the exterior of the local interstellar clouds include two nearby early B-type stars, $\\epsilon$ CMa ($124\\pm2$ pc) and $\\beta$ CMa ($151\\pm5$ pc), three hot dwarfs, and the local hot bubble (LHB). Line emission (170-912A) from highly ionized metals (Fe, Ne, Mg) in million-degree LHB plasma may be responsible for the elevated ionization fractions of helium ($n_{\\rm HeII}/n_{\\rm He} \\approx 0.4$) compared to hydrogen ($n_{\\rm HII} / n_{\\rm H} \\approx 0.2$) in the local clouds. We update the stellar parameters and ionizing flux for $\\beta$ CMa, after correcting the EUV spectra for intervening HI column density, $N_{\\rm HI} = 1.9\\pm0.1\\times10^{18}~{\\rm cm}^{-2}$, and its hotter effective temperature, $T_{\\rm eff} \\approx 25,000$K vs. 21,000K for $\\epsilon$ CMa. These two stars produce a combined H-ionizing photon flux $\\Phi_{\\rm H} \\approx 6800\\pm1400$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at the external surface of the local clouds. The hot bubble could produce comparable fluxes, $\\Phi_{\\rm H} =$ 2000-9000 cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, depending on the amount of metal depletion into dust grains that survive sputtering. The radial velocities and proper motions of $\\beta$ CMa and $\\epsilon$ CMa indicate that both stars passed within $10\\pm1$ pc of the Sun $4.4\\pm0.1$ Myr ago, with 100-200 times higher local ionizing fluxes. At that time, the local clouds were likely farther from the Sun, owing to their transverse motion. Over the last few Myr, EUV radiation from these two stars left a wake of highly ionized gas in a hot, low-density cavity produced by past supernova explosions in the Sco-Cen OB association and connected with the LHB.",

        "abstract": "The James Webb Space Telescope is orders of magnitude more sensitive than any other facility across the near to mid-infrared wavelengths. Many approved programs take advantage of its highly stable point spread function (PSF) to directly detect faint companions using diverse high-contrast imaging (HCI) techniques. However, periodic re-phasing of the Optical Telescope Element (OTE) is required due to slow thermal drifts distorting to the primary mirror backplane along with stochastic tilt events on individual mirror segments. Many programs utilize observations of a reference star to remove the stellar contribution within an image which can typically take half of the total allocated time. We present a high-contrast imaging technique for the NIRISS instrument that uses the measured wavefront error (WFE) from a phase calibration observation (performed roughly every 48 hours) as prior information in a Bayesian analysis with nested sampling. This technique estimates the WFE of a given observation and simultaneously searches for faint companions, without using a reference star. We estimate the wavefront error for both full aperture and aperture masking interferometry (AMI) imaging modes using three low order Zernike coefficients per mirror segment, using the Hexike basis, to generate synthetic PSFs and compare to simulations. We compare our technique to traditional interferometric analysis in realistic NIRISS F430M simulations both relative to the photon noise limit, and through recovering an injected companion with $\\Delta$F430M= 8 mag at 0.2''. With future testing, this technique may save significant amounts of observing time given the results of our current implementation on NIRISS simulations.",

We present the first $5\\times2$pt analysis of ACT DR6 lensing, DESI LS, and Planck ISW. Within $\\Lambda$CDM, this yields $S_8 = \\sigma_8(\\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.819 \\pm 0.016$, in good agreement with primary CMB inferences and provides a sound-horizon-free Hubble constant constraint of $H_0 = 70.0 \\pm 4.4$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Then, combining with CMB primary and BAO, we reconfirm a CMB-BAO discrepancy in the $\\Omega_m$-$\\frac{D_v}{r_d}$ plane, which is heightened when combining BAO with the $5\\times2$pt data vector. We explore two dark-energy extensions that may reconcile this: an early-time modification, early dark energy (EDE), and late-time dynamical dark energy (DDE) parameterized by $w_0w_a$. For CMB primary+BAO+$5\\times2$pt, we find a $3.3\\sigma$ preference for DDE over $\\Lambda$CDM, while EDE is modestly favoured at $2.3\\sigma$. The models address different shortcomings of $\\Lambda$CDM: DDE relaxes the neutrino mass bound ($M_\\nu<0.17$eV vs. $<0.050$eV under $\\Lambda$CDM), making it compatible with neutrino oscillation measurements, while EDE raises the Hubble constant to $H_0=70.5\\pm1.2\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$, easing the discrepancy with SH0ES. However, neither model resolves both issues simultaneously.

        "abstract": "Binary neutron star mergers are unique probes of matter at extreme density and standard candles of cosmic expansion. The only such event observed in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation, GW170817, revealed the origin of heavy elements, constrained the neutron star equation of state, and provided an independent measurement of the Hubble constant. Current detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA capture only the final minutes of inspiral, offering limited advance warning and coarse sky localization. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of binary neutron star signals for lunar-based gravitational-wave observatories (LILA, LGWA, GLOC) envisioned within NASA's Artemis and Commercial Lunar Payload Services programs, and compare their performance with current and next-generation Earth-based facilities. For GW170817-like sources, we find that lunar detectors can forecast mergers weeks to months in advance and localize them to areas as small as 0.01 deg$^{2}$, far beyond the reach of terrestrial detectors. We further show that lunar observatories would detect on the order of 100 well-localized mergers annually, enabling coordinated multi-messenger follow-up. When combined in a multi-band LIGO+Moon network, sky-localization areas shrink to just a few arcsec$^{2}$, comparable to the field of view of the James Webb Space Telescope at high zoom. Multi-band parameter estimation also delivers dramatic gains: neutron star mass-ratio uncertainties can be measured with $\\sim0.1\\%$ precision, spin constraints to 0.001$\\%$ with luminosity distance errors to 1$\\%$ level, enabling precision measurements of the equation of state and the cosmic expansion rate.

        "title": "Overlap-aware segmentation for topological reconstruction of obscured objects",
        "abstract": "The separation of overlapping objects presents a significant challenge in scientific imaging. While deep learning segmentation-regression algorithms can predict pixel-wise intensities, they typically treat all regions equally rather than prioritizing overlap regions where attribution is most ambiguous. Recent advances in instance segmentation show that weighting regions of pixel overlap in training can improve segmentation boundary predictions in regions of overlap, but this idea has not yet been extended to segmentation regression. We address this with Overlap-Aware Segmentation of ImageS (OASIS): a new segmentation-regression framework with a weighted loss function designed to prioritize regions of object-overlap during training, enabling extraction of pixel intensities and topological features from heavily obscured objects. We demonstrate OASIS in the context of the MIGDAL experiment, which aims to directly image the Migdal effect--a rare process where electron emission is induced by nuclear scattering--in a low-pressure optical time projection chamber. This setting poses an extreme test case, as the target for reconstruction is a faint electron recoil track which is often heavily-buried within the orders-of-magnitude brighter nuclear recoil track. Compared to unweighted training, OASIS improves median intensity reconstruction errors from -32% to -14% for low-energy electron tracks (4-5 keV) and improves topological intersection-over-union scores from 0.828 to 0.855. These performance gains demonstrate OASIS's ability to recover obscured signals in overlap-dominated regions. The framework provides a generalizable methodology for scientific imaging where pixels represent physical quantities and overlap obscures features of interest. All code is openly available to facilitate cross-domain adoption.",

We aim to investigate the distribution and sizes of charged PAHs across the key zones of the Orion Bar PDR. We employ JWST MIRI-MRS observations of the Orion Bar from the Early Release Science program ''PDRs4All'' and synthetic images in the JWST MIRI filters. We investigate the spatial morphology of the AIBs at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.0 $\\mu$m that commonly trace PAH cations, and the neutral PAH-tracing 11.2 $\\mu$m AIB, their (relative) correlations, and the relationship with existing empirical prescriptions for AIBs. The 6.2. 7.7, 8.6, 11.0, and 11.2 $\\mu$m AIBs are similar in spatial morphology, on larger scales. Analyzing three-feature intensity correlations, two distinct groups emerge: the 8.6 and 11.0 $\\mu$m vs. the 6.2 and 7.7 $\\mu$m AIBs. We attribute these correlations to PAH size. The 6.2 and 7.7 $\\mu$m AIBs trace cationic, medium-sized PAHs. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that the 8.6 $\\mu$m AIB is carried by large, compact, cationic PAHs, and the 11.0 $\\mu$m AIB's correlation to it implies, so is this band. The 6.2/8.6 and 7.7/8.6 PAH band ratios thus probe PAH size. We conclude that the 6.2/11.2 AIB ratio is the most reliable proxy for charged PAHs, within the cohort. We outline JWST MIRI imaging prescriptions that serve as effective tracers of the PAH ionization fraction as traced. This study showcases the efficacy of the 6-9 $\\mu$m AIBs to probe the charge state and size distribution of the emitting PAHs, offering insights into the physical conditions of their host environments.

We show that intrinsically quantum effects are washed out by mode averaging or small amounts of noise, and significantly suppressed by the weakness of the axion coupling.

We confirm that the local luminosity function is best explained by a double power law. The evolution of the luminosity function of FSRQs follows a luminosity-dependent density evolution. FSRQs experience positive evolution with their space density growing with increasing redshift up to a maximum redshift, after which the numbers decrease. This peak in redshift occurs at larger redshifts for higher luminosity sources and at lower redshifts for lower luminosity sources. We find an unexpected similarity between the luminosity function of FSRQs and that of BL Lacertae objects at intermediate luminosity. This could be a sign of a strong genetic link between the two blazar sub-classes or that BL Lac samples are contaminated by large amounts of FSRQs with their jets nearly perfectly aligned with our line of sight.",

        "abstract": "We present a comprehensive long-term multi-wavelength study of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) NGC 3822, based on 17 years (2008 to 2025) of X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), and optical observations.The dataset includes observations from Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, the Very Large Telescope, and the Himalayan Chandra Telescope. Our multiwavelength light curve analysis reveals flux variations across X-ray to optical/UV bands, with an increased variability amplitude at shorter wavelengths. X-ray spectral analysis indicates the presence of intrinsic absorption during the 2016 and 2022 observations; however, this absorption disappeared before and after these epochs. The presence and absence of the absorber are attributed to clouds moving in and out of the line of sight. During the long-term monitoring period, the bolometric luminosity of the source varies between ($1.32-17)\\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Optical spectroscopic monitoring reveals changing-look (CL) behaviour in NGC~3822, characterized by the appearance and disappearance of broad emission lines (BELs). These CL transitions are associated with changes in the Eddington ratio rather than changes in the obscuration. The BELs appear only when the Eddington ratio is relatively high ($\\sim 3.8\\times10^{-3}$) and disappear when it drops to a lower value ($\\sim 0.9\\times10^{-3}$).",

        "abstract": "Stars primarily form in galactic spiral arms within dense, filamentary molecular clouds. The largest and most elongated of these molecular clouds are referred to as ``bones,\" which are massive, velocity-coherent filaments (lengths ~20 to >100 pc, widths ~1-2 pc) that run approximately parallel and in close proximity to the Galactic plane. While these bones have been generally well characterized, the importance and structure of their magnetic fields (B-fields) remain largely unconstrained. Through the SOFIA Legacy program FIELDMAPS, we mapped the B-fields of 10 bones in the Milky Way. We found that their B-fields are varied, with no single preferred alignment along the entire spine of the bones. At higher column densities, the spines of the bones are more likely to align perpendicularly to the B-fields, although this is not ubiquitous, and the alignment shows no strong correlation with the locations of identified young stellar objects. We estimated the B-field strengths across the bones and found them to be ~30-150 $\\mu$G at pc scales. Despite the generally low virial parameters, the B-fields are strong compared to the local gravity, suggesting that B-fields play a significant role in resisting global collapse. Moreover, the B-fields may slow and guide gas flow during dissipation. Recent star formation within the bones may be due to high-density pockets at smaller scales, which could have formed before or simultaneously with the bones.",

The VLA radio polarization study shows a PD = 2.2 +/- 0.2 % with a Faraday-corrected intrinsic polarization angle of 1 +/- 5 degree, which is an indication of the jet axis.

        "abstract": "Nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\\mathrm{sym}}(\\rho)$ encoding the cost to make nuclear matter more neutron rich has been the most uncertain component of the EOS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter. It affects significantly the radii, tidal deformations, cooling rates and frequencies of various oscillation modes of isolated neutron stars as well as the strain amplitude and frequencies of gravitational waves from their mergers, besides its many effects on structures of nuclei as well as the dynamics and observables of their collisions. Siemens (1970s) observed that $E_{\\mathrm{sym}}(\\rho)$ scales as $(\\rho/\\rho_0)^{2/3}$ near the saturation density $\\rho_0$ of nuclear matter, since both the kinetic part and the potential contribution (quadratic in momentum) exhibit this dependence. The scaling holds if: (1) the nucleon isoscalar potential is quadratic in momentum, and (2) the isovector interaction is weakly density dependent. After examining many empirical evidences and understanding theoretical findings in the literature we conclude that: (1) Siemens' $\\rho^{2/3}$ scaling is robust and serves as a valuable benchmark for both nuclear theories and experiments up to $2\\rho_0$ but breaks down at higher densities, (2) Experimental and theoretical findings about $E_{\\mathrm{sym}}(\\rho)$ up to $2\\rho_0$ are broadly consistent, but uncertainties remain large for its curvature $K_{\\mathrm{sym}}$ and higher-order parameters, (3) Above $2\\rho_0$, uncertainties grow due to poorly constrained spin-isospin dependent tensor and three-body forces as well as the resulting nucleon short-range correlations. Looking forward, combining multimessengers from both observations of neutron stars and terrestrial heavy-ion reaction experiments is the most promising path to finally constraining precisely the high-density $E_{\\mathrm{sym}}(\\rho)$ and the EOS of supradense neutron-rich matter.",

        "abstract": "Accretion rates in radio galaxies are typically estimated from optical and total radio flux measurements, incorporating emission from the core, jets, and lobes. These estimates can be used to investigate the link between observed Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) emission properties and the underlying accretion physics of their Super-Massive Black Holes (SMBHs). However, while optical and core radio emission trace the ongoing accretion episode, extended jet and lobe structures may result from past AGN activity. Therefore, accretion rates inferred from spatially unresolved radio observations may be systematically overestimated, a bias whose prevalence and extent have yet to be thoroughly explored. In this study, using a sample of 121 local radio-loud galaxies with spatially resolved radio components, we assess this effect by estimating their \\textit{Eddington}-scaled accretion rates ($\\lambda$) using both the common methodology which considers total radio fluxes and a simple but novel approach that treats core and extended emission as signatures of distinct accretion phases. Our results show that the former method systematically overestimates the $\\lambda$ by a factor of $\\sim 3$, affecting the accretion mode classification in approximately $11\\%$ of sources. This discrepancy appears to correlate with radio size, with the most extended galaxies indicating a transition in accretion disk mode. Such a bias could affect AGN classification in unresolved high-redshift radio surveys. Our results motivate re-examining accretion rate calculations from AGN radio surveys and align with the AGN unification model for radio galaxies, revealing a clearer link between accretion disk physics and optical spectral properties.",

In the present study, we investigate the scalarization of neutron stars in different stages of the evolvement. For this aim, we apply the isentropic equations of state for the neutron star matter including nucleons, hyperons, and $\\Delta$- resonances in neutrino-trapped, neutrino diffusion, and neutrino-transparent stages as well as cold-catalyzed neutron star. Our equations of state are based on the relativistic model within the mean-field approximation.

Our calculations confirm that the neutron star scalarization is affected by the hyperons as well as the $\\Delta$-resonances.

These trends challenge simple single-zone synchrotron models and suggest a more intricate, turbulent jet structure with multiple emission zones. We develop a statistical framework to model the observed energy-dependent polarization patterns in blazars, focusing on the behavior captured by IXPE in the X-ray band and RoboPol in the optical. The goal is to statistically characterize multi-zone models in terms of the distributions of cell size and the physical parameters of the electron energy distribution (EED). A Monte Carlo approach, implemented with the JetSeT code, is used to generate synthetic multi-zone synchrotron emission from a spherical region filled with turbulent cells with randomly distributed physical properties. Simulations explore scenarios ranging from identical cells to power-law distributions of cell sizes and EED parameters with variable cutoff and low-energy slopes. The results show that a purely turbulent, multi-zone model can reproduce the observed energy-dependent polarization without requiring correlations between cell size and EED parameters. The polarization degree is primarily determined by the effective, flux-weighted, number of emitting cells, modulated by the dispersion in cell properties, particularly the EED cutoff energy at high frequencies and the low-energy spectral index at low frequencies. With a fractional dispersion in cutoff energy of about 90% and a low-energy spectral index dispersion of ~0.5-1.5, the model reproduces the chromatic mm-to-X-ray polarization trends seen by IXPE and the optical polarization limiting envelope observed in the RoboPol dataset.",

By analyzing the different terms in the perturbation series, we demonstrate the structure of infrared divergence cancellations, as required by the equivalence principle. We also derive the forms of the counterterms required to renormalize the ultraviolet divergences.

This energy-dependent behavior may reflect thermal instabilities, with the shorter correlation timescale in the disk compared to the corona. Alternatively, it may reflect variable Comptonizations of seed photons from different disk regions. Inner-disk photons are scattered by a small inner corona, producing soft X-rays. Outer-disk photons interact with an extended, jet-like corona, resulting in harder emission. The QPO is captured by an SHO component with a stable period of $\\sim 0.2$ s and a high quality factor of $\\sim 10$. The absence of significant evolution with energy or time of the SHO component suggests a connection between the accretion disk and the corona, which may be built by coherent oscillations of disk-corona driven by magnetorotational instability. The AWN components are present in all the three-band data and dominate over the DRW and SHO components. We interpret the AWN as another fast DRW with its $\\tau_{\\rm DRW} < 0.01$ s. It may trace high-frequency fluctuations that occur in both the inner region of the accretion disk and the corona. Overall, our work reveals a timescale hierarchy in the coupled disk-corona scenario: fast DRW < SHO < disk DRW < corona DRW.",

        "abstract": "Gamma-ray bursts are flashes of high-energy radiation lasting from a fraction of a second to several hours. Military satellites made the first detections of GRBs in the late 1960s. The $\\gamma$-ray emission forms from shocks in a relativistic jet launched from a compact central engine. In addition to the emission of $\\gamma$-rays, the interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium yields afterglow emission that can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum. Redshift measurements from these afterglows place GRBs from the local to the distant Universe. The central engines of GRBs are thought to be either a hyperaccreting black hole or a highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar). There is now strong observational evidence that this central engine is created either in the core collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star or via the merger of two compact objects (neutron stars or a neutron star with a black hole). The combination of stellar scale events with extreme energies and luminosities makes GRBs powerful probes of the extreme physics involved in their production and of other areas of astrophysics and cosmology. These include as the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources, the production and acceleration of relativistic jets, the synthesis of heavy elements, the study of the interstellar and intergalactic medium, and the identification of the collapse of early generations of stars.",

        "abstract": "We present the results of multi-frequency monitoring of the radio quasar 3C 286, conducted using three instruments: ALMA at 91.5, 103.5, 233.0, and 343.4 GHz, the IRAM 30-m Telescope at 86 and 229 GHz, and SMA at 225 GHz. The IRAM measurements from 2006 to 2024 show that the total flux of 3C 286 is stable within measurement uncertainties, indicating long-term stability up to 229 GHz, when applying a fixed Kelvin-to-Jansky conversion factor throughout its dataset. ALMA data from 2018 to 2024 exhibit a decrease in flux, which up to 4% could be attributed to an apparent increase in the absolute brightness of Uranus, the primary flux calibrator for ALMA with the ESA4 model. Taken together, these results suggest that the intrinsic total flux of 3C 286 has remained stable up to 229 GHz over the monitoring period. The polarization properties of 3C 286 are stable across all observing frequencies. The electric vector position angle (EVPA) gradually rotates as a function of wavelength squared, which is well described by a single power-law over the full frequency range. We therefore propose using the theoretical EVPA values from this model curve for absolute EVPA calibration between 5 and 343.4 GHz. The Faraday rotation measure increases as a function of frequency up to (3.2+/-1.5)x10^4 rad m^-2, following RM proportional to nu^alpha with alpha = 2.05+/-0.06. This trend is consistent with the core-shift effect expected in a conical jet.",

        "abstract": "Disk galaxies like the Milky Way are expected to experience gas flows carrying matter toward their centers. This paper investigates the role of these radial gas flows in models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We follow five different parameterizations of the Galactocentric radial velocity, $v_{r,g}$, of the interstellar medium (ISM). Relative to the $v_{r,g}=0$ limit, all models predict stellar metallicity to decline less significantly with age in the outer disk and more significantly in the inner disk. This outcome arises because radial flows cannot remove gas from one region of the Galaxy without placing it elsewhere, leading to opposing effects on enrichment timescales between the inner and outer Galaxy. This prediction is at odds with recent observational constraints, which indicate remarkably minimal decline in metallicity ($\\lesssim$$0.1$ dex) between young ($\\sim$$0-2$ Gyr) and old populations ($\\sim$$8-10$ Gyr) across the \\textit{entire} Galactic disk. Radial gas flows cannot be the sole explanation of this result at all Galactocentric radii. Our models reproduce this result at $R\\gtrsim6$ kpc if the flow velocity is relatively constant in both radius and time near $v_{r,g}\\approx-1$ km/s. In agreement with previous GCE models, all of our flow prescriptions lead to lower metallicities and steeper radial gradients relative to static models. Exploiting this universal outcome, we identify mixing effects and the relative rates of star formation and metal-poor accretion as the processes that establish the ISM metallicity at low redshift. We provide a suite of analytic formulae describing radial metallicity gradient evolution based on this connection.",

        "abstract": "Supernova remnants (SNRs) are the aftermath of massive stellar explosions or of a white dwarf in a binary system, representing critical phases in the life cycle of stars and playing an important role in galactic evolution. Physical properties of SNRs such as their shock velocity, density and age are important elements for constraining models for their evolution and understanding the physical processes responsible for their morphological appearance and emission processes. Our study provides, for the first time, a comprehensive statistical analysis of the physical parameters in 64 Galactic SNRs both as a population as well as regions within individual objects. These 64 objects represent the subset of the 310 known Galactic SNRs for which there are published optical data, from which we compiled their physical parameters through an exhaustive literature survey. Through a systematic statistical analysis accounting for uncertainties and/or upper and lower limits in these parameters we obtain distributions of the electron density and shock velocity in the studied SNRs and regions within them. This information is combined with constraints on their age and type. Analysis of electron density and shock velocity distributions for the entire sample of SNRs shows that they are consistent with a log-normal distribution and a skewed log-normal distribution, respectively. Within individual remnants, our study reveals that electron density and shock velocity show larger scatter in younger objects, reflecting the varying conditions of the ambient medium immediately surrounding the explosion epicenter and their impact on SNR evolution. Comparison of the dependence of the shock velocity and density on the supernova age with expectations from theoretical models shows good agreement.",

The infall produces observable wiggles in the channel maps, analogous to those produce by the gravitational instability (GI), along with large-scale arcs and filaments. GI induced spiral arms produce radial velocity perturbations that point towards the center of the spiral arm owing to their higher self-gravity. We found a similar signature from infall-induced spiral arms, despite not including self-gravity in our simulation. Our study suggests that recent evidence of GI in the kinematics of the disk around AB Aur may instead be due to the observed infall, without the need for invoking GI.",

However, several challenges involving the robustness and applicability of such models remain. Designing model architectures with inductive biases relevant for the task can help mitigate the problem. Three such deep learning-based models are proposed, trained, and evaluated on simulated data: (1) a hybrid convolutional and graph neural network model (CNN-GNN) using both image and graph data; (2) an enhanced CNN-GNN variant that incorporates additional reconstructed information within the graph construction; and (3) a graph neural network (GNN) model using image moments serving as a baseline.

In these blazars, synchrotron emission peaking above keV energies is reprocessed to very-high-energy (VHE, energies > 100 GeV) gamma rays, often resulting in very hard TeV spectra. Over the past two decades, they have attracted a growing interest from the scientific community, both experimentally and theoretically, as crucial targets for understanding the diversity within the blazar class. On the experimental side, new sources have been detected and characterized, populating the extreme blazars class. Notably, VHE campaigns have revealed evidence of emerging spectral differences in this energy band, suggesting inhomogeneity within this class of sources. Recent studies have also unveiled intriguing differences in the temporal evolution of their spectral emission. On the theoretical side, these spectral differences are challenging the current standard emission and acceleration models for blazars, suggesting the need for more complex theoretical frameworks. In this contribution, we present the latest results from recent MAGIC Collaboration observing campaigns aimed to enlarge the extreme blazars population at VHE and understand the origin of their extreme properties. Furthermore, we will present the results of the most recent observations, discussing analogies and differences with well-known sources such as the archetypal 1ES 0229+200, as well as interpretations of their non-conventional spectral emission.",

Since only a small number of RGs are detected in gamma rays compared to the largest known radio population, the correlation between radio and gamma-ray emission serves as a crucial tool to characterize the gamma-ray properties of these sources. We analyse the population of RGs using two samples. The first sample contains 26 sources individually detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at gamma rays. The second sample contains 210 RGs for which the gamma-ray emission is not significantly detected by the LAT. We use a stacking analysis to characterize the average properties of the gamma-ray emission of the two samples, separately at first and then combined. We then evaluate the correlation between their gamma-ray emission and the emission from their radio core at 5 GHz, and we use it to determine their contribution to the IGRB. Due to the limited number of RGs detected at the gamma-rays, information on the gamma-ray luminosity function is limited. The correlation between the gamma-ray emission and the emission of the radio core allows us to characterize it starting from the luminosity function of the radio cores, which is modeled with greater accuracy due to the larger number of sources detected at these frequencies. We find that the diffuse emission as extrapolated from the properties of the subthreshold RGs is lower than the one inferred from detected RGs, showing that the contribution of the population of RGs to the IGRB is lower than the previous estimates and it is around the 30% level of the IGRB intensity.",

The images are first processed in order to remove most of the background or foreground coronal structures (essentially streamers) which are superimposed on the CME. The analysis is based on forward modeling of an asymmetric structure where the plasma is homogeneously distributed in a thin shell and synthetic images are calculated from Thomson scattering by the electrons. They are best fitted to the images to determine the exact shape of the flux rope, and to track its evolution characterized by a radial propagation in self-similar expansion. The analysis supports the forward propagation (over the backward one) characterized by constant accelerations of 76 and 46 m/sec^2 for the front and rear parts of the CME, respectively. The respective velocities at 20 Rsun reach 2000 and 1100 km/s, and its mass unbiased by projection effects is estimated at 1.7x10^16 g. Altogether, these are quite exceptionally large values among CMEs and imply a very energetic event. No erupting event could be identified at or near the calculated initial location of the CME. It lies 25{\\deg} west of the active region NOAA 10484, the site of contemporary, violent, and recurrent solar eruptions (the ``Halloween event'') and a putative connection would require a strong deflection over a very short path. Therefore, the origin of this CME remains unclear.",

        "abstract": "Small scale extreme ultraviolet (EUV) transient brightenings are observationally abundant and critically important to investigate. Determining whether they share the same physical mechanisms as larger scale flares would have significant implications for the coronal heating problem. A recent study has revealed that quasi periodic pulsations (QPPs), a common feature in both solar and stellar flares, may also be present in EUV brightenings in the quiet Sun (QS). We aim to characterise the properties of EUV brightenings and their associated QPPs in both QS and active regions (ARs) using unprecedented 1 s cadence observations from Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). We applied an automated detection algorithm to analyse statistical properties of EUV brightenings. QPPs were identified using complementary techniques optimised for both stationary and non stationary signals, including a Fourier based method, ensemble empirical mode decomposition, and wavelet analysis. Over 500000 and 300000 brightenings were detected in ARs and QS regions, respectively. Brightenings with lifetimes shorter than 3 s were detected, demonstrating the importance of high temporal resolution. QPP periods span from 5 to over 500 s and show similar distributions between AR and QS. We found a consistent power law scaling, with a weak correlation and a large spread, between QPP period and lifetime in EUV brightenings, solar, and stellar flares. The results support the interpretation that EUV brightenings may represent a small scale manifestation of the same physical mechanisms driving larger solar and stellar flares. Furthermore, the similarity in the statistical properties of EUV brightenings and their associated QPPs between AR and QS regions suggests that the underlying generation mechanisms may not strongly depend on the large scale magnetic environment.",

Heating occurs intermittently at discrete locations on the chromospheric surface, modeled through a surface coarse-graining procedure that produces non-thermal boundary conditions for the Vlasov equation. The resulting stationary distribution functions generate suprathermal particle populations and naturally lead to a temperature inversion via gravitational filtering, without any local coronal heating. The model reproduces realistic temperature and density profiles with a thin transition region and a hot corona, consistent with solar observations.

In this work, we revisit the quantum-corrected Higgs inflation scenario within the framework of a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory. Starting from the one-loop effective action, we incorporate radiative corrections through the anomalous scaling parameter ${\\bf A_I}$ and derive analytic expressions for the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$ in the Einstein frame. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum corrections naturally shift $n_s$ toward higher values while keeping the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ suppressed. For ${\\cal N} = 60$, the model predicts $n_s \\simeq 0.9743$ and $r \\simeq 5.4\\times10^{-3}$, in excellent agreement with the latest ACT+DESI (P-ACT-LB) data and fully consistent with the \\textit{Planck}~2018 limit $r < 0.036$. The derived constraint $4.36\\times10^{-10} < \\lambda/\\xi^{2} < 10.77\\times10^{-10}$ confirms the robustness of the quantum-corrected Higgs framework and indicates that near-future CMB polarization experiments such as CORE, AliCPT, LiteBIRD, and CMB-S4 will be able to probe the predicted parameter space with high precision.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic flux emergence and decay in the Sun span from days to months. However, their tracking is typically limited to about half a solar rotation when relying on single-vantage-point observations. Combining observations from both the Earth-facing and far side of the Sun, we monitored the magnetic and coronal evolution and characterised the non-potentiality of one of the most complex and eruptive regions of the past two decades, over more than three full solar rotations. We used photospheric magnetograms and EUV filtergrams from the Solar Orbiter and the Solar Dynamics Observatory along with flare detections from the GOES and the STIX instrument on board the Solar Orbiter. All images were deprojected into a common coordinate system and merged into a unified dataset. We tracked the evolution of magnetic flux and EUV emission and computed magnetic field parameters from the line-of-sight magnetograms to quantify the region's non-potentiality. We identified the region's initial emergence and followed its evolution through to its decay. The region developed through successive flux emergence episodes over a period of 20 days, reached its peak complexity one month after the first emergence, and gradually decayed over the subsequent two months. Unlike many complex regions, it consistently maintained high levels of non-potentiality for most of its lifetime, sustaining equally strong flaring activity. The derived time series of non-potentiality parameters, the first of their kind, far exceeded the typical 14-day window imposed by solar rotation and were remarkably consistent, exhibiting strong correlation with the flaring activity of the region. Multi-vantage-point observations can significantly improve our understanding of how magnetic flux emerges, evolves, and drives solar activity, beyond the two-week limit imposed by solar rotation on observations along the Sun-Earth line.",

        "abstract": "We present detailed analysis of an active region coronal jet accompanying a minifilament eruption that is fully captured and well-resolved in high spatial resolution 174A coronal images from Solar Orbiters Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). The active region jet is simultaneously observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). An erupting minifilament is rooted at the edge of an active region where mixed-polarity magnetic flux is present. Minority-polarity positive flux merges and cancels with the active regions dominant negative flux at an average rate of 1019 Mx/hr, building a minifilament-holding flux rope and triggering its eruption. The eruption shows a slow rise followed by a fast rise, akin to large-scale filament eruptions. EUI images and Mg II k spectra, displaying simultaneously blueshifts and redshifts at the opposite edges of the spire, indicate counterclockwise untwisting of the jet spire. This jet is the clearest, most comprehensively observed active-region jet with this instrument set, displaying striking similarities with quiet Sun and coronal hole jets. Its magnetic, thermal, and kinetic   energies suggest a significant contribution to local coronal heating. We conclude that magnetic flux cancelation builds a minifilament-carrying twisted flux rope and also eventually triggers the flux ropes eruption that makes the coronal jet, in line with our recent results on the buildup and explosion of solar coronal jets in quiet Sun and coronal holes. That is, this active region jet clearly works the same way as the vast majority of quiet Sun and coronal hole jets.",

        "abstract": "The intrinsic width and scattering distributions of fast radio bursts (FRBs) inform on their emission mechanism and local environment, and act as a source of detection bias and, hence, an obfuscating factor when performing FRB population and cosmological studies. Here, we utilise a sample of 29 FRBs with measured high-time-resolution properties and known redshift, which were detected using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients Survey (CRAFT), to model these distributions. Using this sample, we estimate the completeness bias of intrinsic width and scattering measurements, and fit the underlying, de-biased distributions in the host rest-frame. We find no evidence for a down-turn towards high values of the intrinsic distributions of either parameter in the 0.01-40 ms range probed by the data. Rather, the intrinsic scattering distribution at 1 GHz is consistent with a log-uniform distribution above 0.04 ms, while the intrinsic width distribution rises as a Gaussian in log-space in the 0.03-0.3 ms range, and is then log-uniform above that. This is inconsistent with previous works, which assumed that these parameters have lognormal distributions. This confirms that FRB observations are currently strongly width- and scattering-limited, and we encourage FRB searches to be extended to higher values of time-width. It also implies a bias in FRB host galaxy studies, although the form of that bias is uncertain. Finally, we find that our updated width and scattering model - when implemented in the zDM code - produces 10% more FRBs at redshift $z=1$ than at $z=0$ when compared to alternative width/scattering models, highlighting that these factors are important to understand when performing FRB population modelling.",

        "abstract": "A striking aspect of the radio profiles of many millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is that they consist of components separated from each other by regions lacking in emission. We devise a technique for determining \"disjoint\" from \"contiguous\" components and show that 35% of MSPs have disjoint components as opposed to only 3% of the slow pulsar population. We surmise that the pulsars with these disjoint components show evidence for both emission above the polar cap and from the current sheet beyond the light cylinder, co-located with gamma-ray emission. For a sub-class of radio MSPs only the light cylinder emission is being observed. It is our contention that almost all of the current population of gamma-ray MSPs show evidence for co-located radio emission. A simple geometric explanation allows the presence (or not) of light cylinder emission and the relationship (or not) between the gamma-ray and radio profiles to be determined. The light-cylinder components have frequently very high polarization and typically flat position-angle traverses thus helping to explain the difficulties in determining the geometry of MSPs. In cases where the geometry can be determined the values broadly align with expectations. If our picture is correct, the beaming fraction of radio MSPs is higher than previously thought and a mechanism is required to produce coherent radio emission far from the stellar surface. This has implications for our understanding of the populations of radio-loud and radio-quiet rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, and could relate to the timing stability of some of these sources.",

From our, magnetic models we found that the nearby coronal hole reduced the stability threshold of the flux ropes, with axial flux values approximately three times lower than in comparable cases without coronal holes. A derivative analysis applied to STEREO coronagraph and OMNI database in situ data revealed no evidence of CME-CME interaction during the early stages of their evolution and identified distinct signatures of two CMEs, along with the interacting flow associated with the nearby coronal hole at 1 au. Moreover, we used hydrodynamic simulations constrained by remote sensing and in situ data to track the different structures in the solar wind. We found a good agreement between data and the models.

The GRB afterglow radiation provides a powerful means to investigate the microphysics of relativistic shocks and to probe the medium surrounding the progenitor of the burst. In this study, we present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of 31 GRBs observed between 2008 and 2024 from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (X-ray Telescope and Burst Alert Telescope) and the Fermi Large Area Telescope, covering photon energies from 0.3 keV to 300 GeV. Our goal is to characterize the broadband spectral properties of GRB afterglows in soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and high-energy gamma rays. We investigate correlations between spectral shape and energy output across different parts of the spectrum. The observed emission is modeled using a forward shock scenario that includes both synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation losses. The results favor an SSC-dominated radiation model in a wind-like medium, consistent with expectations for long-duration GRBs. Crucially, this work provides new benchmarks for the microphysical parameters governing the emission, particularly indicating a notably low magnetic energy fraction, which refines previous estimates. By modeling broadband data, this study offers one of the most detailed SSC analyses in a wind-like environment to date. Notably, our results naturally account for the comparable energy output observed in both the soft X-ray and TeV bands, consistent with the previously detected TeV-GRBs.",

We explore this using entropy-complexity and information planes, where the measure for entropy is formed using either permutation entropy or the degree distribution of a horizontal visibility graph (HVG). The entropy is then compared to the Jensen complexity (Jensen-Shannon complexity plane) and Fisher information measure (Fisher-Shannon information plane), formed both from permutations and the HVG approach. Additionally we characterise the solar wind time series by studying the properties of the HVG degree distribution. Four types of solar wind intervals have been analysed, namely fast streams, slow streams, magnetic clouds and sheath regions, all of which have distinct origins and interplanetary characteristics. Our results show that, overall, different metrics give similar results but Fisher-Shannon, which gives a more local measure of complexity, leads to a larger spread of values in the entropy-complexity plane. Magnetic cloud intervals stood out in all approaches, in particular when analysing the magnetic field magnitude. Differences between solar wind types (except for magnetic clouds) were typically more distinct for larger time lags, suggesting universality in fluctuations for small scales. The fluctuations within the solar wind time series were generally found to be stochastic, in agreement with previous studies. The use of information theory tools in the analysis of solar wind time series can help to identify structures and provide insight into their origin and formation.",

        "title": "Comparing LSTM-Based Sequence-to-Sequence Forecasting Strategies for 24-Hour Solar Proton Flux Profiles Using GOES Data",
        "abstract": "Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites, astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by NOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs. combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data, and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data preprocessing.",

        "title": "Land use and anisotropy of artificial light observed by night time satellite",
        "abstract": "Upward emission of artificial light has been investigated by researchers since the commissioning of the Visible/Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) in 2011, with applications ranging from night time light mapping to quantifying socio-economical development. The wide swath of the VIIRS-DNB sensor enables detection of artificial light at multiple angles and was utilized to study emission of artificial light from cities at different angles as well as atmospheric properties. Existing studies of the relationship between the directionality and land surface features are not available for most of the Earth's surface due to the use of space-borne LiDAR as a source of proxy. To solve this problem, we compared the land use data published under the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) against the fit parameters of radiance of upward artificial light. In general, the quadratic term of the fit, which quantifies how the brightness changes when viewing closer from the horizon at a point on the Earth, is negative when the area is \"Continuous urban fabric\" or \"Sparsely vegetated areas\", and vice versa for all other investigated land use classes. However the quadratic term shifts towards negative values for brighter areas. These results indicate that while densely built areas emit more light towards the zenith than sideways, the VIIRS-DNB is unable to distinguish small densely built areas scattered around larger unbuilt areas. Therefore, sensors with higher spatial resolution will be required to resolve the light emission patterns of areas with complicated combinations of land uses.",

        "title": "Empirical Optimization of the Source-Surface Height in the PFSS extrapolation",
        "abstract": "The potential field source surface (PFSS) method is a widely used magnetic field extrapolation technique in the space weather community. The only free parameter in the PFSS method is the source-surface height ($R_{\\rm SS}$), beyond which all field lines are open. Although $R_{\\rm SS}$ is known to vary with solar activity, there is no consensus on how to determine it for a given surface magnetic field distribution. In this study, we investigate the nature of $R_{\\rm SS}$ using a long-period (2006-2023) data, covering two solar minima and one maximum. We adopt ADAPT-GONG magnetograms and determine $R_{\\rm SS}$ by matching the open flux estimated from observations at 1 au with that calculated using the PFSS method. Our analysis reveals that $R_{\\rm SS}$ increases slightly after the solar minima and around the solar maximum, and that it can be characterized by both the mean unsigned photospheric magnetic field strength and the dipolarity parameter $f_{\\rm dip}$, defined as $f_{\\rm dip} = B_{\\rm dip}^2/(B_{\\rm dip}^2 + B_{\\rm quad}^2 + B_{\\rm oct}^2)$, with $B_{\\rm dip}$, $B_{\\rm quad}$, and $B_{\\rm oct}$ denoting the magnitudes of dipolar, quadrupolar, and octupolar components of photospheric radial magnetic field, respectively. Our results suggest that $R_{\\rm SS}$ does not exhibit a simple monotonic dependence on the solar activity and must be determined by properly considering both surface magnetic field strength and global field structure.",

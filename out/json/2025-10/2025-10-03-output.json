In this work, we connect the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the GD-1 stream to the number density and internal structure of dark matter subhalos in the mass range $10^5$-$10^9\\ M_\\odot$. We measure the radial velocity dispersion of GD-1 based on 160 identified member stars across four different spectroscopic catalogs. We use repeat observations of the same stars to constrain binarity. We find that the stream's intrinsic radial velocity dispersion ranges from approximately 2-5 km/s across its length. The region of GD-1 with the highest velocity dispersion represents a $4\\sigma$ deviation from unperturbed stream models formed in a smooth Milky Way potential, which are substantially colder. We use perturbation theory to model the stream's velocity dispersion as a function of dark matter subhalo population parameters, including the number of low-mass subhalos in the Milky Way, the dark matter half-mode mass, and the mass-concentration relation of subhalos. We find that the observed velocity dispersion can be explained by numerous impacts with low-mass dark matter subhalos, or by a single impact with a very compact subhalo with $M \\gtrsim 10^8\\ M_\\odot$. Our constraint on the fraction of mass in subhalos is $f_{\\mathrm{sub}} = 0.05^{+0.08}_{-0.03}$ (68\\% confidence). In both scenarios, our model prefers subhalos that are more compact compared to CDM mass-size expectations. These results suggest a possible deviation from CDM at low subhalo masses, which may be accounted for by dark matter self-interactions that predict higher concentrations in lower-mass subhalos.",

Here we analyse Milky Way analogue systems in the cosmological simulation TNG-50 to resolve this apparent contradiction. We show that, as the satellite populations of individual hosts rapidly change, the observed anisotropies of their satellite systems are invariably short-lived, with lifetimes of no more than a few hundred million years. However, when the progenitors of the same satellites are traced backwards, we find examples where those identified to form a plane at the present day have retained spatial coherence over several Gyr.

        "abstract": "Stellar feedback drives multiphase gas outflows from starburst galaxies, but the interpretation of dust emission in these winds remains uncertain. To investigate this, we analyze new JWST mid-infrared images tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 7.7 and 11.3~$\\mu$m from the outflow of the prototypical starburst M82 out to $3.2$ kpc. We find that PAH emission shows significant correlations with CO, H$\\alpha$, and X-ray emission within the outflow, though the strengths and behaviors of these correlations vary with gas phase and distance from the starburst. PAH emission correlates strongly with cold molecular gas, with PAH--CO scaling relations in the wind nearly identical to those in galaxy disks despite the very different conditions. The H$\\alpha$--PAH correlation indicates that H$\\alpha$ traces the surfaces of PAH-bearing clouds, consistent with arising from ionized layers produced by shocks. Meanwhile the PAH--X-ray correlation disappears once distance effects are controlled for past 2~kpc, suggesting that PAHs are decoupled from the hot gas and the global correlation merely reflects the large-scale structure of the outflow. The PAH-to-neutral gas ratio remains nearly flat to 2~kpc, with variations following changes in the radiation field. This implies that the product of PAH abundance and dust-to-gas ratio does not change significantly over the inner portion of the outflow. Together, these results demonstrate that PAHs robustly trace the cold phase of M82's wind, surviving well beyond the starburst and providing a powerful, high-resolution proxy for mapping the life cycle of entrained cold material in galactic outflows.",

GC populations are initialized with identical distributions in normalized $E$-$L_{z}$ in matched CDM and FDM halos. In a universe dominated by FDM, we identify three distinct regimes for the in-situ GC population depending on the particle mass $m_{22} \\equiv m_{\\chi}/ 10^{-22}~\\mathrm{eV}$. For $m_{22}  7$, the dark matter becomes both compact and globally dominant, generating a deeper and more extended gravitational potential that supports a wider range of stable GC orbits, resulting in more massive and spatially extended GC systems. Finally, we extend our framework to make predictions for GC populations in alternative DM models, including warm dark matter and self-interacting dark matter, in both MW-like and dwarf galaxies. Our findings demonstrate that in-situ GC systems offer a sensitive and independent probe of the underlying DM physics, opening new avenues for observational constraints with upcoming Euclid.",

We use the BRAHMA simulations with constrained initial conditions to investigate BH assembly in extreme overdense regions. The simulations implement heavy seeds ($\\sim 10^4-10^5 M_{\\odot})$ forming in dense, metal-poor gas exposed to sufficient Lyman-Werner flux. With gas accretion modeled via Bondi-Hoyle formalism and BH dynamics and mergers using a subgrid dynamical friction scheme, we isolate the impact of seeding, dynamics, accretion, and feedback on early BH growth. With fiducial stellar and AGN feedback inherited from IllustrisTNG, accretion is strongly suppressed at $z \\gtrsim 9$, leaving mergers as the dominant growth channel. Gas accretion dominates at $z \\lesssim 9$, where permissive models (super-Eddington or low radiative efficiency) build $\\sim 10^9\\ M_{\\odot}$ BHs powering quasars by $z \\sim 6$, while stricter IllustrisTNG-based prescriptions yield much lower BH masses ($\\sim 10^6-10^8\\ M_{\\odot}$). Our seed models strongly affect merger-driven growth at $z \\gtrsim 9$: only the most lenient models (with $\\sim 10^5\\ M_{\\odot}$ seeds) produce enough BH mergers to reach $\\gtrsim 10^6\\ M_{\\odot}$ by $z \\sim 10$, consistent with current estimates for GN-z11.

If the BH-to-stellar mass ratios of these sources are indeed as extreme as currently inferred, they would require either very short BH merger timescales or reduced AGN thermal feedback. Weaker stellar feedback boosts both star formation and BH accretion and cannot raise these ratios.",

Most previous studies have relied on heuristic theories, or numerical simulations that may be hard to extrapolate to stellar parameters. In this work, we present the first rigorous asymptotic calculation of (passive) chemical transport by IGWs, in the limit of small wave amplitude. We find that the net transport by a coherent packet of waves scales like wave amplitude to the fourth power, and verify these analytic calculations with numerical simulations. Because the transport is equally likely to be positive as negative, the transport by a random superposition of waves is expected to scale as wave amplitude to the eighth power. These results show that closer comparisons between theoretical arguments and numerical calculations are essential for interpreting numerical simulations of chemical transport by IGWs, and making accurate predictions of this process for stellar evolution modeling.",

In SIDM, these quantities evolve continuously through gravothermal processes, spanning core-expansion and core-collapse phases, in sharp contrast to cold dark matter, where they remain nearly static after halo formation. This SIDM evolution further depends on tidal environment and merger history, which can be probed through strong lensing. We also identify simulated SIDM halos whose properties are consistent with the properties of low-mass perturbers inferred from recent observations, and we demonstrate that the core-collapse mechanism offers a compelling explanation for their observed high densities.

The model reveals substantial deviations in the emissivities of the lambda3889 and lambda7065 lines in the case of a non-zero optical depth, with previous models systematically underestimating and overestimating them by 5 to 20 percent, respectively. In the optically thin case, however, our results show good agreement with previous studies.

In addition, we present new fitting formulae for radiative transfer corrections for several He I lines relevant to optical and near-infrared observations, covering 0 <= tau_3889 <= 10 within the same density and temperature ranges. The accuracy of the obtained approximations is <= 0.1 percent within the specified parameter range.

        "abstract": "Galaxies with a disk morphology have been established at $z > 9$ with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). However, confirming their disky nature requires studying their gas kinematics, which can be challenging when relying solely on the warm gas observed by JWST. Unlike the cold gas traced by the Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array (ALMA), warm gas is sensitive to outflows, complicating the interpretation of the disk dynamics. This elicits the question of how to compare information obtained from varied tracers, as well as how to physically interpret the low angular and spectral resolution observations generally available at high redshift. We address these challenges through comparative kinematic analysis of idealised and realistic NIRSpec/IFU mock observations derived from two galaxies in the SERRA suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations. With these synthetic data, we determine the robustness of dynamical information recovered from typical IFU observations, and test widely-used criteria for identifying disks and gaseous outflows at high redshift. We find that at the typical NIRSpec/IFU spectral and angular resolution ($\\sim$ 0.05\"/pixel), non-circular motions due to inflows or outflows can mimic the smooth velocity gradient indicative of a disk, and bias measured velocity dispersion upwards by a factor of $2-3\\times$. As a result, the level of rotational support may be underestimated in the NIRSpec/IFU observations. However, the recovered dynamical mass appears to be relatively robust despite biases in $v_\\text{rot}$ and $\\sigma$.",

        "abstract": "We present the discovery and characterisation of two Ly$\\alpha$ nebulae (LANs), RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat, as satellite structures of two giant LANs at $z=2.920$ and 3.092. They are found neighbouring two out of four known giant LANs at $z\\sim3$ in our MUSE follow-up observations, reinforcing the idea that Ly$\\alpha$ emission can be used to trace massive dark matter halos at high-$z$. This high occurrence of massive satellite halos agrees with simulations. With sizes of $\\simeq80\\times160$ and $80\\times100~\\mathrm{pkpc}^2$, the two nebulae are both $\\sim$300pkpc from the main LANs. The Ly$\\alpha$ emission is only shifted by $\\simeq100-300$ km s$^{-1}$ between each of the two pairs, suggesting connections via large-scale structure. RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat are estimated to have log$(M_\\mathrm{h}/M_\\odot)\\simeq13.2\\pm0.3$ and $12.8\\pm0.3$, putting them potentially close to the regime of cold-mode accretion. The central brightest galaxies in the two halos are morphologically distinct despite having similar stellar mass $\\sim10^{11}M_\\odot$, one being an elliptical quiescent galaxy in RO-1001-Sat and the other being a dusty star-forming spiral in RO-0959-Sat. Intriguingly, the quiescent galaxy aligns well with the peak of the LAN as well as the potential well of the host halo, making it the first clear-cut case where the cold gas ought to be accreting onto the galaxy but with no observable star formation, either due to morphological quenching or, more likely, radio-mode feedback from an active galactic nucleus. Finally, we show a tentative detection of a Ly$\\alpha$ filament connecting RO-1001 and RO-1001-Sat. This work shows how panoramic MUSE (and in the future, BlueMUSE) observations of massive halo seeds can be used to efficiently search for additional halos, unveiling their large-scale structure and enabling the study of Ly$\\alpha$-selected galaxy groups.",

        "abstract": "High resolution, ultraviolet imaging is often unavailable across the sky, even in heavily studied fields such as the Chandra Deep Field - South. The Habitable Worlds Observatory is one of two upcoming missions with the possibility of significant UV capabilities, and the only one early enough in development to consider suggestions to its design. In this paper, we conduct an initial study of how current common UV filter sets affect the results of spectral energy distribution fitting for the estimation of galaxy parameter. This initial look is intended to motivate the need for future, more robust, SED fitting of mock galaxies. We compare the broad near UV and far UV filters used by the GALEX mission to the three more narrow Swift UVOT filters. We find that the GALEX filters result in larger errors when calculating the UV beta parameter compared to UVOT, and provide little constraint on the star formation age of a galaxy. We further note the ability of the UVOT filters to investigate the 2175\\r{A} attenuation bump; GALEX has a reduced capacity to trace this same feature. Ultimately, we recommend that in order to optimize the effectiveness of HWO's ultraviolet capacity for transformative astrophysics, a minimum of a FUV filter with three medium band NUV filters should be adopted. This will combine the power of GALEX's wavelength range with the finer sampling of UVOT around an important dust feature.",

In this work, we aim to find a simple and effective formula to estimate the stellar mass from the images of galaxies delivered by the currently popular DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. This survey provides an unsurpassed combination of a deep imaging with an extensive sky coverage in up to four photometric bands. We calibrated the sought formula against a sample of local galaxies observed by the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G) that was directly dedicated to measure the stellar masses. For the absolute magnitudes $M_g$ and $M_r$ of a galaxy in the Legacy Surveys $g$ and $r$ bands, we find that the stellar masses can be estimated as $0.673M_g - 1.108M_r + 0.996$ with the scatter of 25\\%. Employing more complex functions does not improve the estimate appreciably, even after including the galaxy ellipticity, S\\'ersic index, or the magnitudes in different Legacy Surveys bands. Generally, measurements in $r$ band were the most helpful ones, while adding $z$-band measurements did not improve the mass estimate much. We provide a Python-based script \\texttt{photomass\\_ls.py} to automatically download images of any galaxy from the Legacy Surveys database, create image masks, generate GALFIT input files with well-assessed initial values, perform the GALFIT photometry, and calculate the stellar mass estimate. Additionally, we tuned another version of the formula to the magnitudes provided by the Siena Galaxy Atlas 2020 (SGA-2020) with a scatter of 29\\%. For both\\,--\\,our default and SGA-2020 formula, we offer two alternatives derived from different calibrations of S$^4$G masses that were based on different methods and assumptions.",

Our analysis uses Gaussian Process modeling to extract robust rotation signals from image subtraction light curves, allowing us unprecedented data access and measurement precision in the crowded cluster field. After applying stringent quality and contamination cuts, we identify 271 reliable rotation periods, representing by far the largest sample of rotators measured in a single intermediate-age cluster. Compared to previous work, which relied on only ~30 stars, our catalog extends the gyrochronological sequence of NGC 6819 with an order of magnitude more measurements and improved precision. The expanded dataset reveals both the expected temperature-dependent spin-down trend and substantial scatter at fixed effective temperature, including a bimodal distribution of fast and slow rotators. We also identify a distinct ``pile-up'' sequence consistent with predictions of weakened magnetic braking at critical Rossby numbers. These results strengthen this cluster's role as a benchmark for stellar spin evolution, while also highlighting the limitations of traditional gyrochronology at older ages.

We aim to investigate how jet magnetization and other physical parameters influence the development of instabilities beyond the first recollimation shock. In particular, we focus on identifying the conditions under which the centrifugal instability (CFI) is effective. We perform high-resolution 2D and 3D simulations using the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code PLUTO. The jets are initialized with a conical geometry and propagate into an ambient medium, and we follow by axisymmetric simulations how they evolve towards a steady-state. In 2D we explore a range of magnetizations (from 0 to 1), pressure contrasts, and inertia ratios to characterize the formation and evolution of recollimation shocks. The results are further evaluated using linear stability analysis to assess the growth and suppression of CFI. Finally, we perform 3D simulations of unstable and stable jets. We discuss how the different parameters of the axisymmetric steady solutions influence the location and strength of recollimation. We find that, even in moderately magnetized jets, $\\sigma$=0.1, the CFI can still develop under suitable local conditions and disrupt the jet structure. This instability is governed by the jet radius, curvature, Lorentz factor, and magnetization, and is not always predictable from injection conditions. While magnetization can delay or locally suppress instability growth, it does not guarantee long-term jet stability. Our 3D results highlight the limitations of 2D models in capturing non-axisymmetric and nonlinear effects, and underline the complex interplay between magnetic confinement and destabilizing mechanisms. These findings have implications for interpreting variability, and polarization structure in AGN jets.",

We investigate the detectability of far-infrared emitters in ALMA deep fields using mock observations by injecting artificial line-emitting sources into the visibility planes. We also discuss our investigation, conducted together with the ALMA operations team, of a possible technical problem in the original observations. Finally, we devise a method to estimate the [CII] luminosity function (LF) at $z \\sim 6$, including a full analysis of signal contamination and sample completeness.   The comparison of pixel distributions between the real and mock datacubes does not show significant differences, confirming that the effect of non-Gaussian noise is negligible for the ADF22 datacube. Using 100 blank mock-mosaic datasets, we show 0.43 $\\pm$ 0.67 false detections per datacube with the previous source-finding method. We argue that the underestimation of the contamination rate in the previous work is caused by the smaller number of datacubes, using only 4 real ADF22 datacubes. We compare the results of clump-finding between the time division mode and frequency division mode correlator datacubes and confirm that the velocity widths of the clumps in the TDM case are up to 3 times wider than in the FDM case.

This paper explores whether or not the local, on scales of $\\approx$1\\,Mpc, galaxy density plays a role in triggering AGN when controlling for stellar mass. We consider this question as a function of redshift and AGN selection in the X-ray vs. in the IR. We use available density maps within the 4.8\\,sq.deg. XMM-LSS field in the redshift range $0.1 < z  1.2$ the incidence of AGN increases in higher density environments, controlling for stellar mass. However, this dependence reverses at $z < 1.2$ where the incidence of IR AGN is higher in lower density environments. By contrast, among X-ray selected AGN there is no significant local density dependence. Bootstraping analysis confirms these conclusions. While these results agree with previous work on both obscured and unobscured AGN this is the first study to use a consistent methodology across IR and X-ray samples, as well as study IR dependence in this full redshift range. Upcoming large spectroscopic surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) galaxy evolution survey will be critical in further elucidating how the environment affects AGN triggering across different cosmic epochs.",

NGC 1266 hosts one such LLAGN, embedded in a massive molecular gas reservoir that is not forming stars, likely due to AGN feedback. We analyze deep archival \\textit{Chandra} data to constrain the properties of its hot gas and compare them to other wind systems. We find temperatures of $0.24$--$1.85$ keV and notably high electron densities of $0.33$--$4.2$ cm$^{-3}$, suggesting significant mass loading, further supported by charge exchange emission in the southern lobe, one of the few AGN systems where it has been detected. We measure pressures and thermal energies of $10^6$--$10^8$~K cm$^{-3}$ and $10^{54}$--$10^{56}$ erg, exceeding the minimum energy needed for the radio jet to power the outflow and implying the hot phase comprises a large fraction of the energy budget. Archival MUSE data reveal a cavity-like feature in the southern outflow, potentially associated with the far side of the outflow cone. At the maximum outflow extent, the warm and hot phases appear to be in pressure equilibrium. Coupled with short cooling timescales of $\\sim$1 Myr, comparable to the advection time, this suggests the outflow is undergoing radiative cooling and may have stalled. Finally, we compare NGC 1266 to other local AGN and starburst galaxies, finding NGC 1266 to be the densest wind in the sample.",

        "abstract": "Using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code MESA, we find that all our models in the initial mass range of 12-40 Mo, regardless of whether they have hydrogen-rich, hydrogen-stripped, or helium+hydrogen-stripped envelopes, have at least one significant strong convective zone in the inner core, which can facilitate the jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We focus on stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors that earlier studies of the JJEM did not study, and examine the angular momentum parameter j=rVconv, where r is the radius of the layer and Vconv is the convective velocity according to the mixing length theory. In all models, there is at least one prominent convective zone with j>2e15 cm^2/s inside the mass coordinate that is the maximum baryonic mass of a neutron star (NS), m=2.65 Mo. According to the JJEM, convection in these zones seeds instabilities above the newly born NS, leading to the formation of intermittent accretion disks that launch pairs of jittering jets, which in turn explode the star. Our finding is encouraging for the JJEM, although it does not show that the intermittent accretion disks indeed form. We strengthen the claim that, according to the JJEM, there are no failed CCSNe and that all massive stars explode. In demonstrating the robust convection in the inner core of stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors, we add to the establishment of the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.",

Using 16-yr Pass 8 data from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we found the GeV emission can be described by two extended sources with different photon spectra. Among them, the much more extended $\\gamma$-ray source SrcA with a Power-law spectrum is spatially coincident with a giant neutral Hydrogen shell structure and several OB stars inside a huge H$_{\\rm{II}}$ region. The softer Log-Parabola spectra $\\gamma$-ray source SrcB is spatially coincident with a star-forming region with several OB stars, maser sources and IR sources. Gas observation results display a dense molecular cloud surrounding SrcB in the velocity range of [-25,-5] km s$^{-1}$. The possible origins of $\\gamma$-ray emission are discussed, including CRs escaped from SNR shock surface and illuminated nearby MC, the young massive star clusters associated with the star-forming region and a pulsar halo generated by an invisible energetic pulsar inside the SNR. Furthermore, under the hadronic scenario, the measured diffusion coefficient in the compact SrcB region is significantly lower than that of the more extended SrcA. This suppression is likely attributed to cosmic-ray-driven instabilities, which reduce the diffusion efficiency in the vicinity of the source relative to the standard conditions in the interstellar medium (ISM). Future advanced analysis from LHAASO observation results would help distinguish the origins of $\\gamma$-ray emission in this region and clarify the nature of this source.",

We identify spatial offsets between the X-ray peak of the hot gas and the SMBH in 80% of the systems, with an average displacement of $\\langle\\Delta^{\\text{SMBH}}_{\\text{X-ray}}\\rangle = 4.8$ kpc (dispersion of $3.8$ kpc).

Our findings suggest that hot gas sloshing primarily drives the observed spatial offsets, with AGN-driven uplift contributing in some systems.Importantly, systems with H$\\alpha$ - SMBH offsets of $\\geq$1 kpc uniformly lack detectable radio cores on VLBA scales, with upper limits on the 5~GHz power of $P_{5\\,\\text{GHz}} \\leq 10^{21-22}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, while those without such offsets exhibit radio powerful AGN with pc-scale radio emission up to $P_{5\\,\\text{GHz}} \\sim 10^{24-25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. This correlation indicates that centrally concentrated warm gas is critical for sustaining radio-loud SMBH activity, possibly supporting scenarios of cold-mode accretion.

The second object, RAD J122622.6+640622, is a ~865 kpc giant radio galaxy whose southern jet is abruptly deflected, inflating a ~100 kpc limb-brightened ring, while the northern jet terminates in a compact hotspot-like feature.

        "abstract": "Gravitational-wave (GW) emissions from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) provide insights into the internal processes leading up to their explosions. Theory predicts that CCSN explosions are driven by hydrodynamical instabilities like the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or neutrino-driven convection, and simulations show that these mechanisms emit GWs at low frequencies ($\\lesssim 0.25 \\,{\\rm kHz}$). Thus the detection of low-frequency GWs, or lack thereof, is useful for constraining explosion mechanisms in CCSNe. This paper introduces the dedicated-frequency framework, which is designed to follow-up GW burst detections using bandpass analyses. The primary aim is to study whether low-frequency (LF) follow-up analyses, limited to $\\leq 256 \\,{\\rm Hz}$, constrain CCSN explosion models in practical observing scenarios. The analysis dataset comprises waveforms from five CCSN models with different strengths of low-frequency GW emissions induced by SASI and/or neutrino-driven convection, injected into the Advanced LIGO data from the Third Observing Run (O3). Eligible candidates for the LF follow-up must satisfy a benchmark detection significance and are identified using the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) algorithm. The LF follow-up analyses are performed using the BayesWave algorithm. Both cWB and BayesWave make minimal assumptions about the signal's morphology. The results suggest that the successful detection of a CCSN in the LF follow-up analysis constrains its explosion mechanism. The dedicated-frequency framework also has other applications. As a demonstration, the loudest trigger from the SN 2019fcn supernova search is followed-up using a high-frequency (HF) analysis, limited to $\\geq 256 \\,{\\rm Hz}$. The trigger has negligible power below $256 \\, {\\rm Hz}$, and the HF analysis successfully enhances its detection significance.",

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its unprecedented near-infrared sensitivity, enables the discovery and characterization of distant substellar objects, including those in the Milky Way's thick disk and halo. We conducted a systematic search using over 40,000 publicly available JWST/NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR spectra and identified 68 brown dwarfs through spectral template matching and visual inspection. Among them, 12 are newly identified candidates, including 8 T dwarfs and 4 M/L dwarfs, most at distances exceeding 1 kpc. Remarkably, two sources -- JWST J001418.22-302223.2 and JWST J033240.07-274907.8 -- are found at distances greater than 5 kpc, making them the most distant brown dwarfs within the Milky Way. Spectral fits were performed using a nested sampling Monte Carlo algorithm with three model grids: Sonora Elf Owl, LOWZ, and SAND. The analysis reveals that cloud-free models are unable to reproduce L/T transition spectra, whereas the SAND model provides a more accurate representation of cloud effects in metal-poor environments. With the newly identified distant brown dwarfs, we also investigated the vertical metallicity gradient of brown dwarfs. Overall, the metallicities do not show an evident trend with Galactic height $|Z|$, due to the limited sample size and the uncertainties in metallicity measurements.",

Whilst the narrative of our home as a 'humdrum' system has become ingrained in the public psyche via Sagan, there are at least two striking facts about our existence which we know are certainly unusual. First, the stelliferous period spans ~10Tyr - yet here we are living in the first 0.1% of that volume. Second, over three-quarters of all stars are low-mass M-dwarfs, stars with no shortage of rocky habitable-zone planets - and yet, again, our existence defies this trend, previously dubbed the Red Sky Paradox. Two plausible resolutions are that a) stars below a certain mass, $M_{crit}$, do not produce observers, and, b) planets have a truncated temporal window for observers, $T_{win}$, negating the longevity advantage of M-dwarfs. We develop a Bayesian model that encompasses both datums and jointly explores the two resolutions covariantly. Our analysis reveals that 1) the hypothesis that these observations are mere luck is disfavored with an overwhelming Bayes factor of ~1600; 2) some truncation of low-mass stars is indispensable, lowering $T_{win}$ alone cannot well-explain the observations; and, 3) the most conservative limit on $M_{crit}$ occurs when fixing $T_{win}=10$Gyr, yielding $M_{crit}>0.34 M_{\\odot}$ [$0.74 M_{\\odot}$] to 2$\\sigma$ [1$\\sigma$].

        "abstract": "The Milky Way's inner region is dominated by a stellar bar and a boxy-peanut shaped bulge. However, which stellar populations inhabit the inner Galaxy or how star formation proceeded there is still unknown. The difficulty in studying these stars stems from their location in dense regions that are strongly impacted by extinction and crowding effects. In this work, we use star formation histories computed in the solar neighbourhood using Gaia Colour-Magnitude Diagram fitting to shed light onto the evolution of the central regions of our Galaxy. For that, we have obtained precise age distributions for the non-negligible amount of super metal-rich stars ([M/H] $\\sim$ 0.5) in the solar neighbourhood (more than 5$\\%$ of the total stars within 400 pc of the plane). Assuming that these stars were born in the inner Galaxy and migrated outwards, those distributions should be indicative of the true stellar age distribution in the inner Galaxy. Surprisingly, we find that these age distributions are not continuous but show clear signs of episodic star formation ($\\sim$~13.5, 10.0, 7.0, 4.0, 2.0 and less than 1~Gyr ago). Interestingly, with the exception of the 4~Gyr event, the timings of the detected events coincide with the formation of the primitive Milky Way and with known merging events or satellite encounters (Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage, Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and the Magellanic Clouds), suggesting that these could have induced enhanced and global star-forming episodes. These results are compatible with a scenario in which Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage is responsible for the formation of the bar 10 Gyr ago. However, we cannot associate any accretion counterpart with the 4-Gyr-ago event, leaving room for a late formation of the bar, as previously proposed.

We perform fits to both primordial element abundances as well as CMB data and determine that up to a decade of late axion domination is allowed by these probes of the early universe. We establish the implications of late axion domination for the matter power spectrum on the scales $1/\\mathrm{Mpc}\\lesssim k \\lesssim 10^3/$Mpc. Our 'log' model predicts a relatively modest bump-like feature together with a small suppression relative to the standard $\\Lambda$CDM predictions on either side of the enhancement. Our 'two-field' model predicts a larger, plateau-like feature that realizes enhancements to the matter power spectrum of up to two orders of magnitude.

However, several key parameters influencing the EOS, such as the maximum mass of neutron stars, spin-down rates, and the potential role of exotic matter in their cores, remain subject of ongoing debate. Here we present a new approach to constraining the EOS by analyzing the X-ray afterglows of some short gamma-ray bursts, focusing on \"the internal plateau\" phase and its abrupt decay, which reflect the spin-down and possible collapse of a supra-massive neutron star into a black hole. By linking critical neutron star masses with black hole formation criteria and the observational data from Swift's BAT and XRT instruments with compact object models, we explore three representative EOSs that range from \"soft\" to \"stiff\". Our result supports a maximum mass for neutron stars of approximately 2.39 solar masses at the threshold of black hole formation. This conclusion holds under assumptions of magnetar-powered X-ray plateaus, constant radiative efficiency, isotropic emission, and full Kerr black hole energy extraction; deviations could influence the inferred results. Our results demonstrate the critical role of neutron star/black hole physics in probing dense nuclear matter and provide a novel framework for exploring extreme astrophysical environments.",

We find three classes of initial conditions characterized by an open (O), closed (C), or flat (F) FRW core surrounded by a shell with higher three-dimensional curvature. In the C case, the core helps the collapse so that the black hole formation threshold is there the lowest among all cases. Type-II black holes might only be generated by Type-O or F (each of those with different thresholds, with O being the highest) or by a Type-C with an effective F core. Finally, we argue that an F core is typically more probable for a sharp power spectrum, however, it is also more likely related to non-spherical initial conditions. On the other hand, a very broad power spectrum, which might be related to the observed NanoGrav signal, would favor the formation of Type-I black holes with a mass spectrum peaked at the Infra-Red scale.",

        "abstract": "One of the most promising targets for Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) is identifying an individual supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) out of the population of binaries theorized to produce a gravitational wave background (GWB). In this work, we emulate an evolving PTA dataset, complete with an increasing number of pulsars and timing baseline, into which we inject a single binary on top of a Gaussian GWB signal. We vary the binary's source parameters, including sky position and frequency, and create an ensemble of simulated datasets with which we assess current Bayesian binary search techniques. We apply two waveform-based template models and a frequency-resolved anisotropy search to these simulations to understand how they compare in their detection and characterization abilities. We find that a template-based search including the full gravitational-wave signal structure (i.e., both Earth and pulsar effects of an incident GW) returns the highest Bayes Factors (BF), exceeding our estimator's capabilities by (S/N)~9-19, and has the most robust parameter estimation. Our anisotropy model attains a realization-median BF>10 at 7<(S/N)<15. Interestingly, despite being a deterministic model, the Earth-term template struggles to detect and characterize low-frequency binaries (5 nHz). These binaries require higher (S/N)~16-19 to reach the same BF threshold. This is likely due to neglected confusion effects between the pulsar and Earth terms. By contrast, the frequency-resolved anisotropy model shows promise for parameter estimation despite treating a binary's GW signal as excess directional GW power without phase modeling. Sky location and frequency parameter constraints returned by the anisotropy model are only surpassed by the Earth term template model at (S/N)~12-13. Milestones for a first detection using the full-signal GW model are included in a companion paper (Petrov et al. 2025).",

        "abstract": "Following the recent evidence for a gravitational wave (GW) background found by pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments, the next major science milestone is resolving individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The detection of these systems could arise via searches using a power-based GW anisotropy model or a deterministic template model. In Schult et al. 2025, we compared the efficacy of these models in constraining the GW signal from a single SMBHB using realistic, near-future PTA datasets, and found that the full-signal deterministic continuous wave (CW) search may achieve detection and characterization first. Here, we continue our analyses using only the CW model given its better performance, focusing now on characterization milestones. We examine the order in which CW parameters are constrained as PTA data are accumulated and the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) grows. We also study how these parameter constraints vary across sources of different sky locations and GW frequencies. We find that the GW frequency and strain are generally constrained at the same time (or S/N), closely followed by the sky location, and later the chirp mass (if the source is highly evolving) and inclination angle. At fixed S/N, sources at higher frequencies generally achieve better precision on the GW frequency, chirp mass, and sky location. The time (and S/N) at which the signal becomes constrained is dependent on the sky location and frequency of the source, with the effects of pulsar terms and PTA geometry playing crucial roles in source detection and localization.",

The recent detections of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at these energies offer an incredible opportunity to investigate the origins of such transient events in an unprecedented way. In this presentation, we analyze the afterglows of these GRBs by modeling their synchrotron and inverse Compton emission within an optimized relativistic fireball framework. By comparing observational data with theoretical predictions, we constrain key model parameters and track their temporal evolution. The comparison of different TeV-detected GRBs reveals an intriguing variety among them, potentially reflecting differences in the particle acceleration processes that have to be very fast and able to accelerate to large energies. We discuss how late-time afterglow observations of X-ray and GeV-TeV emissions are crucial for providing diagnostics into the physics of GRBs. At this scope, we also present the most updated results of the AGILE telescope, which support our interpretation.

Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J0136, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k=3) at pressure levels (> 1 bar) corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation suggest North/South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. These vertical maps demonstrate robust interaction between deep convective weather layers and the overlying stratified and radiative atmosphere. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (< 100 mbar), we find that the mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.",

In spectra taken with XSHOOTER at ESO's Very Large Telescope as well as NIRSPEC and MIRI on the James Webb Space Telescope, the object transitions from quiescence in April-May 2025 to a strongly enhanced accretion phase in June-August 2025. The line flux changes correspond to a 6-8-fold increase in the mass accretion rate, reaching $10^{-7}$ M$_{\\mathrm{Jupiter}}$yr$^{-1}$, the highest measured in a planetary-mass object. During the burst, the H$\\alpha$ line develops a double-peaked profile with red-shifted absorption, as observed in stars and brown dwarfs undergoing magnetospheric accretion. The optical continuum increases by a factor of 3-6; the object is $\\sim$1.5-2 mag brighter in the R-band during the burst. Mid-infrared continuum fluxes rise by 10-20%, with clear changes in the hydrocarbon emission lines from the disk. We detect water vapour emission at 6.5-7 $\\mu m$, which were absent in quiescence. By the end of our observing campaign, the burst was still ongoing, implying a duration of at least two months. A 2016 spectrum also shows high accretion levels, suggesting that this object may undergo recurring bursts. The observed event is inconsistent with typical variability in accreting young stars and instead matches the duration, amplitude and line spectrum of an EXor-type burst, making Cha1107-7626 the first substellar object with evidence of a potentially recurring EXor burst.",

Beyond delivering substantial performance improvements, cuHPX ensures high numerical accuracy, analytic gradients for integration with deep learning frameworks, out-of-core memory-efficient optimization, and flexible regridding between HEALPix, equiangular, and other common spherical grid formats. Through evaluation, we show that cuHPX achieves rapid spectral convergence and delivers over 20 times speedup compared to existing libraries, while maintaining numerical consistency.

This suppression leaves such structures elongated and confined to scales comparable to the Larmor radius of the particles. The presence of a magnetic guide field of sufficient strength, or a greater scale separation between the initial size of the magnetic structures and the Larmor radius, restores the system's ability to inverse transfer magnetic energy. These results reveal that inverse energy transfer in collisionless plasmas is not guaranteed, but instead sensitively depends on magnetization. In the astrophysical context, this identifies a kinetic mechanism by which Weibel-generated seed fields may fail to merge consistently, potentially limiting their role in cosmic magnetogenesis.",

Among all the scenarios explored, the expected number of strong lensed events detected in a 4-year observation time in LISA ranges between 0.13-231 with most of them having two (one) images detectable in the heavy (light) seed scenarios. The event numbers obtained correspond to 0.2%-0.9% of all detected unlensed events.

However, even in scenarios where DR is 'secluded', i.e., only gravitationally interacting with SM and DM, it can leave discernible signatures. We present a comprehensive study of four different types of DR: free-streaming, self-interacting (coupled), decoupling, and recoupling DR, and vary initial conditions to include both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations. In addition to these properties, we also vary neutrino energy density, DR energy density, and the SM neutrino masses to perform a general analysis and study degeneracies among neutrino and DR properties. We derive constraints using the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, and supernova datasets. We find no significant preference for physics beyond the $\\Lambda$CDM model, but data exhibit interesting interplays between different physical quantities. When the neutrino energy density is allowed to vary, we find that the cosmological dataset prefers massless free-streaming DR over massive neutrinos, leading to a significant relaxation of the neutrino mass bound. Although we do not find any evidence of DR isocurvature, the data show support for a strong blue tilt of the isocurvature power spectrum. Our analysis also highlights the degeneracy of various DR parameters with the Hubble constant $H_0$ resulting in a mild relaxation of the $H_0$ tension.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we introduce a novel generative denoising diffusion model for synthesizing the Sun's three-dimensional coronal magnetic field, a complex and dynamic region characterized by evolving magnetic structures. Despite daily variability, these structures exhibit recurring patterns and long-term cyclic trends, presenting unique modeling challenges and opportunities at the intersection of physics and machine learning. Our generative approach employs an innovative architecture influenced by Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO), operating within the spherical harmonic domain, where the scalar field corresponds directly to the magnetic potential under physical constraints. We trained this model using an extensive dataset comprising 11.7 years of daily coupled simulations from the Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport-Wang Sheeley Arge (ADAPT-WSA) model, further enhanced by data augmentation. Initial results demonstrate the model's capability to conditionally generate physically realistic magnetic fields reflective of distinct phases within the 11-year solar cycle: from solar minimum ($S = 0$) to solar maximum ($S = 1$). This approach represents a significant step toward advanced generative three-dimensional modeling in Heliophysics, with potential applications in solar forecasting, data assimilation, inverse problem-solving, and broader impacts in areas such as procedural generation of physically-informed graphical assets.",

However, the accuracy of these simulations and the discrepancies between simulated and real data remain significant concerns, particularly for large-scale neutrino telescopes that operate in complex natural media. In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for reducing dependence on labeled datasets. Here, we present the first self-supervised training pipeline for neutrino telescopes, leveraging point cloud transformers and masked autoencoders. By shifting the majority of training to real data, this approach minimizes reliance on simulations, thereby mitigating associated systematic uncertainties.

The spin period (P) of this neutron star decreased from its discovered value of 46.6 s to a value of 45.984(1) s, indicating a spin-up at the rate of \\dot{P} = -1.13 x 10^{-9} s s^{-1}. This spin-up rate is used to calculate a high pulsar magnetic field value of 2.25 x 10^{13} G. This process also gives a low magnetic field value, which we rule out here by constraining the inner accretion disk radius to be less than the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit. The pulse profile, analyzed in soft, hard, and broad X-ray bands, shows a double-peaked structure, consistent with pencil beam emission from two antipodal hot spots on the neutron star surface. We also perform spin phase-resolved spectroscopy for the first time, revealing spectral variations across different phases of the pulsar's rotation. These results offer new insights into the long-term spin evolution and emission properties of SXP 46.6.",

We aim to pinpoint the location of the $\\gamma$-ray emitting region within its jet in order to derive strong constraints on $\\gamma$-ray emission models for blazar jets. We use radio and $\\gamma$-ray data obtained with ALMA, OVRO, SMA and Fermi/LAT to study the cross-correlation between $\\gamma$-ray and multi-frequency radio light curves. Moreover, we employ VLBA observations at 43 GHz over a period of around nine years to study the parsec-scale jet kinematics. To pinpoint the location of the $\\gamma$-ray emitting region, we use a model in which outbursts shown in the $\\gamma$-ray and radio light curves are produced when moving jet components pass through the $\\gamma$-ray emitting and the radio core regions. We find two bright and compact newly ejected jet components that are likely associated with a high activity period visible in the $\\gamma$-ray and radio light curves. The kinematic analysis of the VLBA observations leads to a maximum apparent jet speed of $\\beta_{app}=19\\pm10$ and an upper limit on the viewing angle of $\\phi$ < 4 deg. We determine the power law indices that are characterizing the jet geometry, brightness temperature distribution, and core shift to be $l=0.974\\pm0.098$, $s=-3.31\\pm0.31$, and $k_r=1.09\\pm0.17$, which are in agreement with a conical jet in equipartition.

The important implications of this Boltzmann suppression have been explored for dark matter freeze-in via renormalizable operators. Here we extend these considerations to the case of ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in for which freeze-in proceeds via non-renormalizable operators. The UV freeze-in variant has a number of appealing features, not least that a given effective field theory can describe a multitude of UV completions, and thus such analyses are model agnostic for a given high dimension freeze-in operator. We undertake model independent analyses of UV freeze-in for portal operators of general mass dimensions. Subsequently, we explore a number of specific examples, namely, Higgs portals, bino dark matter, and gravitino dark matter. Finally, we discuss how significant differences arise if one departs from the standard assumptions regarding inflationary reheating (i.e. transitions from an early matter dominated era to radiation domination). As a motivated example we examine the implications of early kination domination. Boltzmann suppressed UV freeze-in is well motivated and permits a number of compelling scenarios. In particular, we highlight that for $T_{\\rm max} \\sim$ 1 TeV it is feasible that the freeze-in mechanism is entirely realized within a couple of orders of magnitude of the TeV scale, making it experimentally accessible in contrast to traditional freeze-in scenarios.",

Relative to canonical young pulsars, CCOs are spinning down at a very slow rate $|\\dot f| <10^{-15}$ s$^{-2}$, implying a surface dipole magnetic field strength $B_s < 10^{11}$ G that is too weak to account for their X-ray emitting hot spots. Two CCO pulsars with sufficiently long monitoring, 1E 1207.4$-$5209 and PSR J0821$-$4300, are seen to deviate from steady spin-down; their timing residuals can be modeled by one or more glitches in $f$ and $\\dot f$, or alternatively by extreme timing noise. For the third CCO pulsar, PSR J1852+0400, the sparse temporal coverage was insufficient to detect such effects. Glitch activity and timing noise in large samples of rotation-powered pulsars correlate best with $\\dot f$, while the timing irregularities of the first two CCOs are extreme compared to pulsars of the same $\\dot f$. Nevertheless, timing activity in CCOs may arise from properties that they share with other young but more energetic pulsars: high internal temperature, strong buried magnetic field and superfluid behavior. Alternatively, continuing low-level accretion of supernova debris is not ruled out as a source of timing noise in CCOs.",

Although the class is rather unified from an optical perspective, their radio characteristics are diverse. One of the biggest curiosities found in these sources is their ability to form and maintain powerful relativistic jets. We studied the radio properties of a sample of 3998 NLS1 galaxies which is the largest clean sample available, thus allowing us to study the population-wide characteristics. We used both historical and ongoing surveys: the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS; 144~MHz), the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST; 1.4~GHz), the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS; 1.4~GHz), and the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS; 3~GHz). We were able to obtain a radio detection for $\\sim40\\%$ of our sources, with the most detections by LoTSS. The majority of the detected NLS1 galaxies are faint ($\\sim1-2$ mJy) and non-variable, suggesting considerable contributions from star formation activities, especially at 144~MHz. However, we identified samples of extreme sources, for example, in fractional variability and radio luminosity, indicating significant AGN activity.

Interestingly, four WFs (IRAS 15445$-$5449, IRAS 18019$-$2216, IRAS 18443$-$0231, and IRAS 18464$-$0140) and one WF candidate (IRAS 18480+0008) are potential planetary nebulae (PNe) because they exhibit radio continuum emission, suggesting the presence of a photoionized region characteristic of PNe. To classify these objects, we obtained K-band (2.0-2.3 $\\mu$m) spectra of these WFs, including the only WF PN known (IRAS 15103$-$5754) for comparison. Our spectra reveal two group of sources: (i) `low-velocity' WFs with H$_2$O maser velocity spread of $\\lesssim$50 km s$^{-1}$ (IRAS 18019$-$2216, IRAS 18464$-$0140, and IRAS 18480+0008) showing the CO band at 2.29 $\\mu$m in absorption, typical of cool giant stars, and no emission lines; and (ii) `high-velocity' WFs, velocity spread of $\\gtrsim$50 km s$^{-1}$ (IRAS 15103$-$5754, IRAS 15445$-$5449, and IRAS 18443$-$0231), exhibiting emission lines of Br$\\gamma$, He I, and H$_2$, consistent with hotter central stars and/or shock-excited emission. The emission line ratios of these lines in IRAS 18443$-$0231 indicates that it may be a nascent PN. The spectrum of IRAS 15445$-$5449 also shows a CO band and Na I doublet in emission, suggesting the presence of a compact circumstellar disk and/or active mass loss. These results favor the previously suggested notion that the difference between low- and high-velocity WFs is not simply a projection effect but reflects intrinsically different evolutionary stages. Moreover, the results are also consistent with the idea of an increase in the jet ejection velocity as the post-AGB evolution proceeds.",

However the primary long range forces between oscillons are gravitational and thus slow-acting relative to the intrinsic timescales of the oscillons themselves. Given that simulations with local gravity are computationally expensive we explore these effects by extracting individual specimens from simulations and then engineering interactions. We find that oscillons experience friction when moving in an inhomogeneous background and, because oscillons in non-relativistic collisions bounce or merge as a function of their relative phases, the outcomes of interactions between ``wild'' oscillons depend on their specific trajectories.",

        "abstract": "Progress in understanding the growth of accreting black holes remains hampered by a lack of sensitive coordinated multiwavelength observations. In particular, the mid-infrared (MIR) regime remains ill-explored except for jet-dominant states. Here, we present comprehensive follow-up of the black hole X-ray binary GX 339-4 during a disc-dominated state in its 2023/24 outburst as part of a multi-wavelength campaign coordinated around JWST/MIRI. The X-ray properties are fairly typical of soft accretion states, with a high-energy Comptonised tail. The source is significantly detected between 5-10$\\mu$m, albeit at a faint flux level requiring MIR compact jet emission to be quenched by a factor of $\\sim$300 or more relative to previous hard-state detections. The MIRI spectrum can be described as a simple power-law with slope $\\alpha$ = +0.39$\\pm$0.07 ($F_\\nu$ $\\propto$ $\\nu^\\alpha$), but surprisingly matches neither the radio/sub-mm nor the optical broadband slopes. Significant MIR stochastic variability is detected. Synchrotron radiation from the same medium responsible for high-energy Comptonisation can self-consistently account for the observed MIRI spectral-timing behaviour, offering new constraints on the physical conditions in the soft-state accretion disc atmosphere/corona. Alternative explanations, including a circumbinary disc or emission from a warm wind, fail to cleanly explain either the spectral properties or the variability. Multiwavelength timing cross-correlations show a puzzlingly long MIR lag relative to the optical, though at limited significance. We compile archival MIR and X-ray luminosities of transient black hole systems, including previously unreported detections of GX 339-4. These trace the evolution of the MIR-to-X-ray flux ratio with accretion state, and also reveal high MIR luminosities for GX 339-4 across all states. (abridged)",

        "abstract": "Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) open a unique window into early-universe physics. While their generation from adiabatic perturbations has been extensively studied, the contribution from isocurvature perturbations remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a lattice simulation framework to compute the stochastic gravitational wave background from both pure isocurvature and mixed initial conditions. Our numerical results show excellent agreement with semi-analytical predictions in the pure isocurvature case. We further analyze multi-peak structures under general initial conditions and find that they closely match those produced in purely adiabatic scenarios. Additionally, we examine SIGWs in early matter-dominated eras, revealing that the peak amplitude and spectral slope are sensitive to the microphysical properties of the dominant field, such as the primordial black hole mass, abundance, or soliton decay rate. This study establishes lattice simulations as a robust tool for predicting SIGW spectra from complex primordial perturbations, with important implications for interpreting current and future gravitational wave observations.",

On 22nd February 2024, during its daily Galactic center monitoring, Swift-XRT detected a VFXT, 7 arcmin from Sgr A* dubbing it Swift J174610--290018. We aim to characterize the outburst that occurred in 2024, and a second, distinct outburst in 2025, to understand the nature and accretion flow properties of this new VFXT. Swift-XRT light curves are used to constrain the duration of the two events. We carried out X-ray spectral analysis exploiting XMM and NuSTAR data. We used Chandra and XMM observations of the last 25 years to constrain the quiescent luminosity of the source. During the 2024 outburst, which lasted about 50 days, the source reached a luminosity in the 2-10 keV band of L_X = 1.2e35 erg s^-1 (assuming it is located at the Galactic center). The 2025 outburst is shorter (about 5 days), and reached L_X = 9e34 erg s^-1. The spectral features of the source include an excess at 6.5-7 keV, which can be associated either with a single reflection line or with the ionized Fe XXV and XXVI lines. The same source was identified in both the XMM and Chandra catalogs of point sources (known as 4XMM J174610.7--290020). During previous detections, the source displayed luminosity levels ranging from L_X= 2e32 to L_X = 3e34 erg s^-1 between 2000 and 2010. Moreover, it exhibited a potential type I X-ray burst in 2004. The analysis of the outbursts and the potential type I burst strongly suggests the neutron star low mass X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) nature of the VFXT. The source can be described by an accretion disk corona (as has been recently proposed by the XRISM/Xtend analysis). This scenario explains the overall low luminosity of this transient and the peculiar iron lines in the spectrum.",

To achieve this, POLAR-2 relies on polarisation measurements and, for the first time will provide these using 2 separate polarimeter detectors. The first of these is a payload optimised to perform Compton polarimetry measurements in the 40-1000 keV energy range using a combination of plastic scintillators and SiPMs. The development of this payload, the design of which is based on lessons learned from the POLAR mission, included optimization of plastic scintillator design. In addition, its development included detailed characterization, space qualification and radiation damage and mitigation strategies for the large number of silicon photo-multipliers included in the design. We will present these along with an overview of the readout electronics. These electronics were developed with flexibility in mind, as well as low cost and low power consumption. As such, its design is of interest beyond this polarimeter and is also used on the spectrometer instrument of POLAR-2 where it is used to read out an array of GAGG:Ce scintillators. This readout, in combination with a coded mask, allows this secondary instrument to provide detailed spectral and localization measurements. The final instrument used in the mission aims to use gas-based detectors to perform polarization measurements in the keV energy region. The novelty of this design is that it will be optimized to use these for wide field of view observations. The combination of the three instruments will allow to perform detailed spectral, localization and polarization measurements of these transient phenomena together for the first time. Here we provide an overview of the technologies employed in the mission along with detailed predictions on its capabilities after its launch currently foreseen in 2027.",

Long-term radio-monitoring at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory has revealed two potential SMBHB candidates: blazars PKS 2131-021 and PKS J0805-0111. These sources show periodic flux density variations across the electromagnetic spectrum, signaling the presence of a good clock. To explain the emission, we propose a generalizable jet model, where a mildly relativistic wind creates an outward-moving helical channel, along which the ultra-relativistic jet propagates. The observed flux variation from the jet is mostly due to aberration. The emission at lower frequency arises at larger radius and its variation is consequently delayed, as observed. Our model reproduces the main observable features of both sources and can be applied to other sources as they are discovered. We make predictions for radio polarization, direct imaging, and emission line variation, which can be tested with forthcoming observations. Our results motivate future numerical simulations of jetted SMBHB systems and have implications for the fueling, structure, and evolution of blazar jets.",

        "abstract": "[Abridged] Optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disks around supermassive black holes are thought to contribute to broad-line emission in type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, observed emission line profiles most often deviate from those expected from a rotating disk. This report examines the role of accretion disks in broad-line emission of Population B AGN characterized by relatively low accretion rates in which broad lines show large redward asymmetry both in H$\\beta$ and Mg II$\\lambda$ 2800. An unbiased comparison matching black hole mass and Eddington ratio suggests that the most powerful radio-loud quasars show the highest red-ward asymmetries in H$\\beta$. These shifts can be accounted for by gravitational and transverse redshift effects, especially for black hole masses larger than $\\approx$10$^{8.7}$ M$_\\odot$. The analysis of the extremely jetted quasar 3C 47 adds another piece to the puzzle: not only are the low ionization profiles of 3C 47 well-described by a relativistic Keplerian accretion disk model, with line emission in the range 100 - 1,000 gravitational radii, but also the high-ionization line profiles can be understood as a combination of disk plus a failed wind contribution that is in turn hiding the disk emission. Constraints on radio properties and line profile variability suggest that 3C 47 might involve the presence of a second black hole with secondary-to-primary mass ratio $\\sim$ 0.5. We conjecture that the double peakers - type-1 AGN with Balmer line profiles consistent with accretion disk emission - might have their emission truncated by the sweeping effect of a second black hole. In non-starving systems, the disk signal is plausibly masked by additional line emission, rendering the disk contribution harder to detect.",

        "abstract": "Recurrent nova U Scorpii (U Sco) is one of the prototypes for a Type Ia supernova progenitor. The logic is that the white dwarf is near the Chandrasekhar mass and gas is accumulating onto its surface at a near-maximal accretion rate, so it will soon increase its mass to the supernova trigger. But the white dwarf loses mass every nova eruption, so the issue is balancing the mass ejected ($M_{\\rm ejecta}$) against the mass accreted between eruptions ($M_{\\rm accreted}$). Measuring $M_{\\rm accreted}$ can be done in several ways to useable accuracy. But the old methods for measuring $M_{\\rm ejecta}$ (involving the flux in hydrogen emission lines) are all with real error bars of 2--3 orders of magnitude. The only solution is to measure the change of the orbital period across the nova eruption ($\\Delta P$). But this solution requires a vast photometric program of eclipse timings stretching decades. For U Sco, a program started in 1989, now reaches its culmination with measures of $\\Delta P$ for the eruptions of 1999, 2010, 2016, and 2022. This paper reports on 52 new eclipse times (for a total of 218 eclipses 1945--2025), plus a new theory result allowing for the confident calculation of $M_{\\rm ejecta}$ from $\\Delta P$. The four eruptions ejected a total of (103$\\pm$14)$\\times$$10^{-6}$ $M_{\\odot}$, while the white dwarf accreted 4$\\times$$10^{-6}$ $M_{\\odot}$ over the four previous eruption cycles. With M$_{\\rm ejecta}$=26$\\times$M$_{\\rm accreted}$, the U Sco white dwarf is losing large masses each eruption cycle, so U Sco can never produce a Type Ia supernova.",

We find that emissions from a softer accretion disk and a harder, centrally located, compact, partially covering, Comptonizing corona explains the continuum spectra from the source throughout the outburst. The disk inner edge temperature, the coronal electron temperature and photon index are found to be around ~ 0.5-0.9 keV, a few keV and ~ 1.1-1.8, respectively, during the entire outburst. We also find an intrinsic atomic hydrogen medium in the system, which substantially and systematically evolved throughout the outburst. We detect two broadband aperiodic features (~ 0.004-2 Hz; ~ 10-100 Hz), with the former having a significant hard lag of ~ 11 ms between 1.5-10.0 keV and 0.5-1.5 keV photons.

Especially below 100 MHz, phase unwrapping difficulties and higher-order dispersion effects can complicate the separation of ionospheric and clock delays. Aims: We address this challenge by introducing a method for reliably separating clock delays from ionospheric effects, even under mediocre to poor ionospheric conditions encountered near solar maximum. Methods: The approach employs a key technique: we modelled our likelihood space using the circular Gaussian distribution (von Mises random variable) rather than non-circular distributions that suffer from $2\\pi$ phase ambiguities. This ensures that noisier data are weighted less heavily than cleaner data during the fitting process. Results: The method reliably separates clock delays and ionospheric terms that vary smoothly in time whilst providing a good fit to the data. A comparison with the clock-ionosphere separation approach used in standard LOFAR data processing shows that our technique achieves significant improvements. In contrast to the old algorithm, which often fails to return reliable results below 100 MHz even under good ionospheric conditions, the new algorithm consistently provides reliable solutions across a wider range of conditions. Conclusions: This new algorithm represents a significant advance for large-scale surveys, offering a more dependable way to study ionospheric effects and furthering research in ionospheric science and low-frequency radio astronomy.",

        "abstract": "Eddington ratio is a paramount parameter governing the accretion history and life cycles of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This short review presents a multi-faceted view of the importance of the Eddington ratio spanning varied AGN studies. We find that the Eddington ratio is crucial for standardizing the Radius-Luminosity (R-L) relation - a necessary step for employing quasars (QSOs) as standardizable cosmological probes to help clarify the standing of the Hubble tension. In this data-driven era, we consolidated disparate aspects by developing novel relations borne out of large datasets, such as the robust, nearly universal anti-correlation between fractional variability and Eddington ratio derived from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, which is vital for interpreting forthcoming high-cadence surveys like Rubin Observatory's LSST. Addressing the conundrum where JWST results suggest an overabundance of massive high-redshift black holes, we demonstrate that local AGNs offer clarification: Changing-Look AGNs (CLAGNs), driven by rapid Eddington ratio shifts, cluster in the low-accretion regime, a rate independently confirmed by our integral field spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of a well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy, rich in high-ionization, forbidden, coronal lines. Conversely, for the high-redshift, high-luminosity population where traditional reverberation mapping (RM) is highly impractical, photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) offers a rapid alternative to constrain accretion disk sizes, enabling efficient estimates of black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Finally, we developed tailored semi-empirical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for extremely high-accretion quasars, successfully validating their characteristic extreme physical conditions.",

        "abstract": "The stochastic gravitational-wave background from compact binary coalescences is expected to be the first detectable stochastic signal via cross-correlation searches with terrestrial detectors. It encodes the cumulative merger history of stellar-mass binaries across cosmic time, offering a unique probe of the high-redshift Universe. However, predicting the background spectrum is challenging due to numerous modeling choices, each with distinct uncertainties. In this work, we present a comprehensive forecast of the astrophysical gravitational-wave background from binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole systems. We systematically assess the impact of uncertainties in population properties, waveform features, and the modeling of the merger rate evolution. By combining all uncertainties, we derive credible bands for the background spectrum, spanning approximately an order of magnitude in the fractional energy density. These results provide thorough predictions to facilitate the interpretation of current upper limits and future detections.",

        "abstract": "Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements play a key role in ruling out post-recombination solutions to the Hubble tension. However, because the data compression leading to these measurements assumes a fiducial $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, their reliability in testing late-time modifications to $\\Lambda$CDM has at times been called into question. We play devil's advocate and posit that fiducial cosmology assumptions do indeed affect BAO measurements in such a way that low-redshift acoustic angular scales (proportional to the Hubble constant $H_0$) are biased low, and test whether such a rescaling can rescue post-recombination solutions. The answer is no. Firstly, strong constraints on the shape of the $z \\lesssim 2$ expansion history from unanchored Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) prevent large deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM. In addition, unless $\\Omega_m$ is significantly lower than $0.3$, the rescaled BAO measurements would be in strong tension with geometrical information from the Cosmic Microwave Background. We demonstrate this explicitly on several dark energy (DE) models ($w$CDM, CPL DE, phenomenologically emergent DE, holographic DE, $\\Lambda_s$CDM, and the negative cosmological constant model), finding that none can address the Hubble tension once unanchored SNeIa are included. We argue that the $\\Lambda_s$CDM sign-switching cosmological constant model possesses interesting features which make it the least unpromising one among those tested. Our results demonstrate that possible fiducial cosmology-induced BAO biases cannot be invoked as loopholes to the Hubble tension \"no-go theorem\", and highlight the extremely important but so far underappreciated role of unanchored SNeIa in ruling out post-recombination solutions.",

        "abstract": "We present new Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) imaging of a MHz-peaked spectrum (MPS) source that was found using commensal low-frequency data taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The source, J0330-2730, was identified in multi-epoch data from the VLA Low-band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (VLITE). VLITE continuously collects low-frequency data at 340 MHz during regular VLA observations. Our analysis of the VLITE light curve demonstrates that J0330-2730 has significant 340 MHz flux variability at the ~20% level over a timescale of approximately one year. Our VLBA images reveal a resolved, double-lobed morphology with a projected linear size of 64 pc. We consider plausible mechanisms that could explain the observed 340 MHz variability and the source properties on milliarcsecond scales. We rule-out variable Doppler boosting and conclude that refractive interstellar scintillation or variable free-free absorption are the most likely explanations. We argue that the properties of J0330-2730 are consistent with the class of compact symmetric objects (CSOs) and consider the evolutionary stage of the source. The extent of the resolved lobes revealed by the VLBA is significantly smaller than predictions based on the turnover-size relation for a standard synchrotron self-absorbed jet model. We discuss possible explanations for the departure from the turnover-size relation, including jet formation by a transient phenomenon such as a tidal disruption event or a \"frustrated jet\" impeded by the presence of dense gas or a high-pressure environment. This study highlights the potential of VLITE for the identification of compact and young radio sources.",

        "abstract": "Achieving accurate photometric characterizations of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) toward the galactic plane is significantly hindered by the high levels of interstellar extinction in these regions. However, near-infrared (NIR) observations offer a more effective alternative, as extinction is substantially reduced at these wavelengths. By mitigating the effects of interstellar extinction via NIR observations of the Galactic disk and bulge, we seek to improve the identification and characterization of CSPNe in these regions, enabling a deeper understanding of their properties and evolutionary status. We used NIR photometry from the VISTA Variables in the V\\'ia L\\'actea (VVV) survey and its extension VVVX to define the NIR photometry of a large sample of CSPNe recently identified with Gaia EDR3 data. We explored the optical and NIR properties of all CSPNe in our sample and searched for eclipsing binary candidates among them by employing relevant catalogs. We present a homogeneous catalog of 1274 CSPNe, including their Z, Y, H, J, and K NIR magnitudes and errors. We also include our findings on the photometric properties of our sample. We report 14 CSPNe with a large IR excess indicating cool companions and/or surrounding discs and 56 eclipsing binary candidates. Based on the present VVVX CSPN catalog, we conclude that NIR photometry can prove valuable for further and in-depth studies of CSPNe. Subsequent studies ought to focus on exploring the true nature of the CSPNe that present IR excess as well as eclipsing-binary CSPNe candidates.",

        "title": "Identifying tidal disruption events among radio transient galaxies",
        "abstract": "We present the optical and infrared properties of a sample of 24 radio transient sources discovered in the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). Previous studies of their radio emission showed that these sources resemble young gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources, but are less powerful and characterized by low-power jets. The bursts of radio activity in most cases are likely due to intrinsic changes in the accretion processes. However, for a few sources in this sample, we cannot rule out the possibility that their radio variability results from a tidal disruption event (TDE). In this work, we extend our analysis to the optical and infrared regimes, confirming that our sample of radio transients is not homogeneous in terms of their optical and infrared properties either. The host galaxies of most of these sources are massive ellipticals with emission dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses typical of radio-loud AGNs ($\\rm >10^7\\,M_{\\odot}$), but exhibit very low accretion activity. In contrast, the sources for which a TDE origin is suspected are either pure star-forming galaxies or show significant ongoing star formation, similar to radio-selected optically-detected TDEs. Additionally, two of them exhibit infrared flares characteristic of TDEs, while the remaining sources do not display significant variability outside the radio regime. Moreover, the evolution of their radio brightness in the W3/radio diagnostic diagram, which we employ in our analysis, also sets our TDE candidates apart from the rest of the sample and resembles the radio variability seen in optically discovered TDEs with radio emission. Finally, based on our findings, we hypothesize that the mid-IR/radio relation can serve as a tool to distinguish between radio transients caused by TDEs and those originating from intrinsic AGN variability.",

        "abstract": "We model the impact of source confusion on photometry and the resulting spectrophotometric redshifts for SPHEREx, a NASA Medium-Class Explorer that is carrying out an all-sky near-infrared spectral survey. Spectral confusion from untargeted background galaxies degrades sensitivity and introduces a spectral bias. Using interpolated spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the COSMOS2020 catalog, we construct a Monte Carlo library of confusion spectra that captures the cumulative impact from faint galaxies. By injecting confusion realizations into galaxy SEDs and performing forced photometry at known source positions, we quantify photometric and redshift error and bias. For our current expected selection of sources for the cosmology analysis, we find typical 1-$\\sigma$ confusion levels range from $0.8-3.8\\ \\mu\\mathrm{Jy}$ across $0.75-5.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. While negligible at full-sky survey depth, spectral confusion becomes significant in the SPHEREx deep fields, reducing the number of intermediate-precision redshifts and inducing a small systematic overestimation in redshift. In parallel, we also model targeted source blending from beam overlaps, which contributes additional photometric noise without systematic redshift bias, provided that positions are known exactly. Together, confusion and blending vary with the depth of the selected reference sample, revealing a trade-off, where deeper selections reduce confusion but increase blending-induced noise. Our methodology informs optimization of the SPHEREx deep-field selection strategy and future treatments of stellar source blending and confusion.",

The proposed framework addresses critical gaps in our current international infrastructure: the absence of coordinated detection, classification and intercept capabilities, insufficient protocols for rapid scientific response and international policy decisions to time-sensitive observations, and the need for effective science communication to maintain government and public support for these ambitious investigations and global threats to Earth. Drawing from successful international collaborations in areas such as the International Space Station (ISS) and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), UNCIO would operate through a dual structure: an executive board for time-critical scientific decisions and an expanded committee for comprehensive stakeholder representation.

The 18-cm OH maser observations of comets allow us to determine (i) the production rate of OH ($Q_{\\rm{OH}}$) and (ii) the water expansion velocity, for each comet. To reveal the physical properties of the periodic comet 12P/Pons-Brooks, we conducted the OH maser observations of the comet using the 40-m TNRT (Thai National Radio Telescope) on March 22nd, 27th and 29th, 2024 before the perihelion passage on April 21st, 2024. We successfully detected 1665 and 1667 MHz OH maser emissions from the comet. The average OH production rates of 12P/Pons-Brooks were determined as 4.28$\\pm$0.30 $\\times$ 10$^{29}$ sec$^{-1}$, 5.21$\\pm$0.42 $\\times$ 10$^{29}$ sec$^{-1}$, and 3.36$\\pm$0.43 $\\times$ 10$^{29}$ sec$^{-1}$ for March 22nd, 27th and 29th, respectively. Combining our results with previous estimates, we find that the OH production rate of 12P/Pons-Brooks shows some fluctuations on timescales of a few days, but gradually increases on longer timescales as the comet approaches the last perihelion. The water expansion velocities of the comet were determined to be 1.55$\\pm$0.14 km s$^{-1}$, 1.55$\\pm$0.35 km s$^{-1}$, and 2.02$^{+0.47}_{-0.45}$ km s$^{-1}$ for the observations on March 22nd, 27th and 29th, respectively. The reason why the errors are different is because the signal to noise ratio is different for each OH maser emission. All expansion velocities are consistent with the individual results of the heuristic law (Tseng et al. 2007) within errors.",

We derive the master wave equations for massless electromagnetic and Dirac perturbations and solve them using the standard Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method along with Pad\\'e approximation. From these solutions, we extract the dominant and overtone quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies along with the associated grey-body factors, highlighting the deviations introduced by quantum gravity corrections compared to the classical case of Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole. Furthermore, we analyze the Unruh-Verlinde temperature of this spacetime, providing quantitative estimates of how quantum gravity effects influence both quasinormal ringing and particle emission in nonsingular black hole models.",

We outline the conditions under which a DM-SM scattering channel gives rise to a drag force on objects in this region, and show that for sufficiently large cross-sections, this effect can lead to observable orbital decay on timescales as short as a single orbital period. We identify the types of objects most strongly affected by this dark drag and place constraints on specific dark matter distributions and interaction strengths, assuming both elastic and inelastic scattering. For inelastic DM, we find sensitivity to mass splittings that reach the MeV scale. We also demonstrate that a DM-induced drag force could potentially contribute to the observed depletion of red giant branch stars in the innermost region of the Milky Way.",

These deviations exhibit significant fluctuations during flares, yet their connection to plasma dynamics has remained unclear. Here, we report a clear correlation between temperature-sensitive flaring plasma emission and element-specific abundance changes for a solar flare. These findings indicate that energy deposition in the chromosphere drives plasma evaporation from different chromospheric heights, modulating elemental abundances. Hydrodynamic simulations support these observations, showing that varying energy deposition magnitudes generate plasma upflows from different chromospheric heights, leading to element-specific FIP fractionation. These results provide new insights into the dynamic coupling of flare energy, plasma flows, and abundance variability, with implications for understanding coupling between different atmospheric layers.",

NuSTAR observed faint coronal nonthermal emission as well as plasma heating > 10 MK, starting 7 minutes prior to the flare. This onset emission implies that during this time, there is a continuous electron acceleration in the corona which could also be responsible for the observed heating. The nonthermal model parameters remained consistent throughout the entire onset, indicating that the electron acceleration process persisted during this time. Furthermore, the onset coincided with a series of type III radio bursts observed by Long Wavelength Array-1, further supporting the presence of electron acceleration before the flare began. We also performed spectral analysis of the impulsive flare emission with STIX (thermal and footpoint emission). STIX footpoints and the onset coronal source were found to have similar electron distribution power-law indices, but with increased low-energy cut-off during the flare time. This could suggest that the nonthermal onset is an early signature of the acceleration mechanism that occurs during the main phase of the flare.",

We combine a superpotential, which is uniquely determined by applying a continuous R symmetry, with two fractional shift-symmetric Kaehler potentials introducing two free parameters (p,N). The inflationary observables provide an excellent match to the recent ACT data for 1.355<=p<=6.7 and 6x10^-5<= N<=0.7. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and possibly detectable primordial gravitational waves with (p,N) values of order unity. A solution to the mu problem of MSSM and baryogenesis via non-thermal leptogenesis can be also accommodated extending the superpotential of the model with suitable terms.",

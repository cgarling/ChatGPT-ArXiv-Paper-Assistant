We then discuss simple methods to populate dark matter halos with galaxies, such as Halo and Sub-halo Abundance Matching techniques and baryonification techniques for capturing baryonic effects on the matter distribution. We finally describe how to model the gas component by solving the Euler-Poisson equations, focusing on the foundational assumptions behind these equations, namely local thermo-dynamical equilibrium, and the nature of the truncation errors of the numerical scheme, namely numerical diffusion. We show a few examples of simulations of a Milky-Way-like halo without cooling, with cooling and with star formation.

These processes can produce more massive stars that may give rise to relatively rare objects such as blue stragglers.

This study utilizes the magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO to simulate collisions and mergers of $5$ to $10 \\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ main-sequence stars, systematically comparing the properties of the resulting products. Both collisions and mergers yield more massive, strongly magnetized, rapidly and differentially rotating stars with cores enriched in hydrogen, but notable quantitative differences emerge. Merger products exhibit core hydrogen fractions up to $10\\%$ higher than those of collision products. In both scenarios, turbulent mixing amplifies magnetic field energies by $9$ to $12$ orders of magnitude. However, magnetic fields in small-impact-parameter collision products display small-scale reversals that may dissipate over time, whereas merger products and large-impact-parameter collision products develop large-scale ordered, potentially long-lived magnetic fields. Additionally, only merger products display magnetically driven, bipolar outflows with radial velocities exceeding $300$ to $400 \\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

Typical numerical simulations of CR transport assume a constant diffusion coefficient for the entire galaxy, despite both numerical and theoretical studies showing that it can change by orders of magnitude depending on the phase of the interstellar medium. Only a few simulations exist that self-consistently calculate CR transport with diffusion, streaming, and advection by the background gas. In this study we explore three subgrid models for CR diffusion, based on popular theories of CR transport. We post-process an isolated, star-forming MHD galactic disk simulated using the RAMSES code. The resulting diffusion coefficients depend solely on the subgrid turbulent kinetic energy and the MHD state variables of the plasma. We use these models to calculate coefficients for vertical transport. We find that they depend critically on the local magnetic field tilt angle. Across models, our resulting diffusion coefficients range from $10^{26}~\\rm cm^2s^{-1}$ to $10^{31}~\\rm cm^2s^{-1}$, and yield CR energy densities at the midplane from $1$ to $100 ~\\rm eV cm^{-3}$, suggesting varied degrees of backreaction on their environment.

        "abstract": "Since the launch of JWST, the sample size of reionization-era Lyman-alpha-emitters (LAEs) has been steadily growing; yet inferences about the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium exhibit increasing variance at redshift z ~ 7, possibly indicating significant field-to-field fluctuations in the progression of cosmic reionization. In this paper, we present new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z ~ 7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and Lyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha damping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard context of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min) = 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral patch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct sub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the nine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a modest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual ionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on an empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling galactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred intergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength). The errorbars on the reddening correction allow fully overlapping bubbles, and our results are consistent with accelerated reionization in the protocluster.",

The focus is on the influence of the Mach number ($Ma$) and the Reynolds number ($Re$) on both the space-local and scale-dependent fluctuations of relevant gas variables, the density, velocity, their derivatives, and the kinetic energy. We carry out hydrodynamical simulations with explicit viscosity and therefore controlled $Re$. We confirm previous work that the probability density functions (PDFs) of the gas density are approximately log-normal and depend on $Ma$. In contrast, derivatives of the density and velocity field are sensitive to $Re$, with the probability of extreme events growing with $Re$. The PDFs of the density gradient and velocity divergence (dilatation) exhibit increasingly heavy tails with growing $Ma$, signalling enhanced internal intermittency. At sufficiently high $Ma$, the statistics of dilatation are observed to saturate at a level determined solely by $Re$, suggesting that turbulent dilatation becomes limited by viscous effects. We also examine the scale-by-scale distribution of kinetic energy through a compressible form of the K\\'arm\\'an-Howarth-Monin (KHM) equation. In the intermediate range of scales, a marked difference is found between subsonic and supersonic turbulence: while Kolmogorov-like scaling applies in the sub- and transonic regimes, supersonic turbulence aligns more closely with Burgers turbulence predictions. The analysis of individual terms in the KHM equation highlights the role of the pressure-velocity coupling as an additional mechanism for converting kinetic energy from large to small scales. Moreover, the contributions of the KHM terms exhibit non-monotonic behaviour with increasing $Ma$, with dilatational effects becoming more pronounced and acting to oppose the cascade of kinetic energy.",

Complementary early-time X-ray monitoring with Swift and Einstein Probe was used to constrain the non-thermal afterglow. We find that both FXRTs remain compatible with a compact binary merger progenitor, which produced low-mass ejecta and kilonova emission subdominant to the afterglow.

The extended code self-consistently evolves nuclear species coupled to hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, and neutrino radiation transport under the conformal flatness approximation to Einstein's equations. Four approximate nuclear networks are included, with stiff source terms integrated using implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes. Validation is performed through benchmarks including conserved-to-primitive recovery with a tabulated stellar equation of state, one-zone silicon burning, and hydrodynamic tests of shock tubes, acoustic pulses, and detonation fronts of Type Ia supernovae. These tests confirm accurate coupling between nuclear reactions and fluid dynamics, conserving electron and nuclear mass fractions to machine precision.   As an application, we conduct spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova simulations. The models reproduce the expected non-exploding behavior of standard progenitors, while enhanced neutrino heating revives the shock. Including nuclear burning modifies the post-shock composition and dynamics, converting silicon and oxygen layers into iron-group nuclei and strengthening the explosion. This demonstrates the impact of explosive burning on ejecta composition and shock evolution, and establishes the stability of the coupled GR radiation-MHD-nuclear framework. The implementation is fully compatible with multidimensional GRMHD simulations and represents the first GRRMHD code combining M1 neutrino transport with fully coupled nuclear burning.",

Using classifier-based architectures enhanced with contrastive and adversarial objectives, we create domain-agnostic models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements over baseline methods in classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection when fine-tuned with minimal real data. Remarkably, our models exhibit effective zero-shot transfer capabilities, achieving comparable performance on future telescope (LSST) simulations when trained solely on existing telescope (ZTF) data. Furthermore, they generalize to very different astronomical phenomena (namely variable stars from NASA's \\textit{Kepler} telescope) despite being trained on transient events, demonstrating cross-domain capabilities.

        "abstract": "Photometric surveys require precise point spread function (PSF) characterization, as it varies across filters and is crucial for accurate photometry and low surface brightness (LSB) studies. However, the small PSF size provided by default pipelines suits only barely resolved objects, making it difficult to analyze regions near bright stars (rendering those regions unusable). These components are then combined to generate a final PSF for each exposure and filter, spanning 15 mag arcsec-2 in surface brightness and 4 arcmin in radius in the broad bands. In narrow-band filters, the J-PLUS PSF exhibits two rings, whereas in broad-band filters, only one ring is observed. Additionally, the position of the ring shifts with filter wavelength: as the filters become redder, the ring radius increases. We find that there is no significant variation in the extended PSF observed as a function of time (within 2.5h) or position in the field of view. The radial profile of NGC 4212 (which is close to a star) is also studied before/after PSF-subtraction. We developed a novel method to determine the central coordinates of saturated stars, and classify stars without using Gaia magnitudes. Additionally, mirror reflections are automatically detected and masked. Furthermore, in combining different stars and various components of the PSF, we avoided the use of a fixed radius by introducing a new method that does not depend on radial measurements. Accurate characterization of the extended PSF and its subtraction improves sky subtraction, increases the effective area of the survey by about 10%, and enables the study of extended large LSB features in wide area surveys like J-PLUS. Our pipeline is published as free software (GNU GPLv3) an can be customized to other surveys such as J-PAS, where its impact will be even greater due to its depth.

        "abstract": "We report the discovery of two z ~ 12 galaxy candidates with unusually red UV slopes (betaUV ~> -1.5), and probe the origin of such colors at cosmic dawn. From Prospector fits to the UNCOVER/MegaScience dataset -- deep JWST/NIRCam imaging of Abell 2744 in 20 broad- and medium-bands -- we identify several new z > 10 galaxies. Medium-band data improve redshift estimates, revealing two lensed (mu ~ 3.3) z ~ 12 galaxies in a close pair with beta_UV ~> -1.5 at an UV absolute magnitude of M_UV ~ -19 mag, lying away from typical scatter on previously known MUV-betaUV relations. SED fitting with Prospector, Bagpipes, and EAZY support their high-z nature, with probability of low-z interlopers of p(z < 7) < 10%. The potential low-z interlopers are z ~ 3 quiescent galaxies (QGs), but unexpected to be detected at the given field of view unless z ~ 3 QG stellar mass function has a strong turn up at log Mstar/Msun ~ 9. Unlike typical blue high-redshift candidates (beta_UV ~< -2.0), these red slopes require either dust or nebular continuum reddening. The dust scenario implies Av ~ 0.8 mag, which is larger than theoretical predictions, but is consistent with a dust-to-stellar mass ratio (log M_dust/M_star ~ -3). The nebular scenario demands dense gas (log nH /cm^3 ~ 4.0) around hot stars (log Teff [K] ~ 4.9). Spectroscopic follow-up is essential to determine their true nature and reveal missing galaxies at the cosmic dawn.",

We have also found $\\sim$40 compact object systems among which are at least 8 newly-identified white-dwarf systems, 3 known X-ray binaries, and one known pulsar. We use eROSITA (soft X-ray) spectra of the Galactic transients to show that two distinct types of flaring systems are prevalent: one having peak around 1 keV, well fit by thermal models, and another having peak below 0.2 keV and requiring a power-law component. Our study also reveals that single star or interacting binary systems (X-ray transients) involving giant stars exhibit significantly higher X-ray luminosities than systems involving only main-sequence stars or young stellar objects. Finally, we discuss the properties of the transients in the context of their putative emission mechanisms, the fraction of transients with respect to the total population, and the rates of Galactic transients expected in blind searches of the X-ray sky.",

Understanding their luminosity function and formation rate is crucial for elucidating their nature. Based on the latest catalog of EP-detected FXTs, we present, a model-independent, non-parametric approach to derive the luminosity function and formation rate of FXTs. Our analysis reveals significant cosmological luminosity evolution, characterized by a scaling relationship of $(1+z)^{3.58}$. After accounting for this evolution, we establish that the local luminosity function is best represented by a broken power law, with a break luminosity of $(4.17 \\pm 0.34) \\times 10^{46}$ erg/s. The formation rate exhibits a gentle decline with redshift, following the relation $(1+z)^{-0.21}$, yielding a local rate of approximately $28.0_{-16.4}^{+27.3}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. This rate is comparable to that of low-luminosity long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). Our findings indicate a potential correlation between FXTs and LGRBs, supporting the majority of FXTs may be linked to collapsar progenitors.",

Our approach forward-models the cosmic shear field using the $\\texttt{CosmoGridV1}$ suite of N-body simulations, including a comprehensive set of systematic effects such as intrinsic alignment, baryonic feedback, photometric redshift uncertainty, shear calibration bias, and shape noise. Using this, we have produced a set of DES Y3-like synthetic measurements for 2-point shear correlation functions $\\xi_{\\pm}$ (2PCFs) and i3PCFs $\\zeta_{\\pm}$ across 6 cosmological and 11 systematic parameters. Having validated these measurements against theoretical predictions and thoroughly examined for potential systematic biases, we have found that the impact of source galaxy clustering and reduced shear on the i3PCF is negligible for Stage-III surveys. Furthermore, we have tested the Gaussianity assumption for the likelihood of our data vector and found that while the sampling distribution of the 2PCF can be well approximated by a Gaussian function, the likelihood of the combined 2PCF + i3PCF data vector including filter sizes of $90'$ and larger can deviate from this assumption. Our SBI pipeline employs masked autoregressive flows to perform neural likelihood estimation and is validated to give statistically accurate posterior estimates. On mock data, we find that including the i3PCF yields a substantial $63.8\\%$ median improvement in the figure of merit for $\\Omega_m - \\sigma_8 - w_0$. These findings are consistent with previous works on the i3PCF and demonstrate that our SBI framework can achieve the accuracy and realism needed to analyse the i3PCF in wide-area weak lensing surveys.",

Overlapping observations between the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the international gravitational-wave detector network are expected soon. Wide-field survey facilities, such as Rubin, can serve dual roles in gravitational-wave astronomy: conducting dedicated optical counterpart searches following gravitational-wave triggers and, through surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), providing opportunities for fortuitous kilonova discoveries during routine operations. We use simulations to develop a strategy for identifying kilonova candidates observed by Rubin and processed by the Fink broker. These candidates can be used as astrophysical triggers for a targeted gravitational-wave search. We simulate kilonovae light-curves for the first year of Rubin with the latest observing strategy for the Wide-Fast-Deep and the Deep Drilling Fields. Assuming a kilonova rate of 250 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, we find that Rubin brokers should observe $\\sim 4$ kilonovae per year with at least one alert above a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 within the gravitational-wave detector horizon ($\\sim 350$ Mpc). Most of these will be faint, and detected 1-2 days following the neutron star merger. Photometric and spectroscopic follow-up will be limited to large telescopes. Using archival data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and our proposed selection criteria, we estimate a minimum contamination of at least 30 events per month from other transients and variables, even under our strictest selection criteria.

Using 1000 \\Euclid-like cluster catalogues, we investigate the effect of systematic uncertainties on cluster summary statistics and their auto- and cross-covariance, and perform a likelihood analysis to evaluate their impact on cosmological constraints, with a focus on the matter density parameter $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and on the power spectrum amplitude $\\sigma_8$. Combining cluster clustering with number counts significantly improves cosmological constraints, with the figure of merit increasing by over 300\\% compared to number counts alone. We confirm that the two probes are uncorrelated, and the cosmological constraints derived from their combination are almost insensitive to the cosmology dependence of the covariance. We find that photometric redshift uncertainties broaden cosmological posteriors by 20--30\\%, while secondary effects like redshift-space distortions (RSDs) have a smaller impact on the posteriors -- 5\\% for clustering alone, 10\\% when combining probes -- but can significantly bias the constraints if neglected. We show that clustering data below $60\\,h^{-1}\\,$Mpc provides additional constraining power, while scales larger than acoustic oscillation scale add almost no information on $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and $\\sigma_8$ parameters. RSDs and photo-$z$ uncertainties also influence the number count covariance, with a significant impact, of about 15--20\\%, on the parameter constraints.",

Using the Space Weather Modelling Framework with the Alfv\\'{e}n Wave Solar Model (SWMF-AWSoM) and dynamo-generated surface magnetic maps, here we model the coronae of four solar-type stars. By incorporating the Sun, our work covers a range of stars with the rotation varying from 1.0 to 23.3 $\\Omega_\\odot$ (periods of 25 to 1 days). Guided by observations, we scale the magnetic field strength with increasing rotation, covering a range between 6.0 G to 1200 G approximately. In our models, energy release associated with small-scale magnetic flux is a key source of coronal heating and is essential for reproducing realistic coronal structures. Our models capture dense (1$-$2 orders of magnitude higher than solar values) and ultra-hot ($\\sim 10\\,\\mathrm{MK}$) coronae dominated by closed field structures. Using the CHIANTI atomic database, we also compute synthetic X-ray spectra and derive the corresponding X-ray luminosities $(L_X)$, which follow a scaling law to magnetic field $L_X \\propto \\langle|\\mathbf{B}|\\rangle^{1.75}$. Furthermore, the coronal X-ray emission is found to be rotationally modulated by the alternating presence of bright active regions and dark coronal holes. These results provide new insights into the extremely high-energy coronae of rapidly rotating solar-type stars, which differ markedly from the Sun.",

We show that bound systems composed of these halos are capable of generating gravitational wave (GW) signals detectable today, even when the individual halos are very light. The Yukawa force dominates the dynamics of these halo binaries, rather than gravity. As a result, large GW signals can be produced at initially extremely high frequencies, which are then redshifted to frequency bands accessible to current or future GW observatories. In addition, the resulting GW signals carry distinctive features that enable future observations to distinguish them from conventional ones. Notably, even if only a tiny fraction of dark matter experiences strong fifth-force interactions, such effects provide a new avenue to discover self-interacting dark matter through GW observations.",

By solving the dispersion relations derived from kinetic theory, taking into account the ponderomotive force due to the beat of incident and scattered waves, we obtain analytical expressions for the linear growth rates of the ordinary, neutral, and charged modes of density fluctuations. Our results clarify which type of scattering dominates under different thermal coupling, resonance, and density conditions. In strong magnetic fields, scattering of perpendicularly polarized waves is generally suppressed, but by different powers of the cyclotron frequency. Moreover, SRS, which is forbidden in unmagnetized electron and positron pair plasma, becomes possible in the charged mode. This framework enables a comprehensive evaluation of induced scattering in extreme astrophysical and laboratory plasma, such as fast radio burst (FRB) emission and propagation in magnetar magnetospheres.",

If the EP is violated, different tracers will undergo different accelerations in response to a uniform gravitational field, and this loss of universality manifests as a dipole with a characteristic $1/K$ scale dependence in the squeezed limit of the bispectrum. In this work we show that such a violation can be identified with a particular anti-symmetric {modulation} in the local cross-power spectrum of distinct tracers. Based on this observation, we propose to test the EP using quadratic estimators as a more practical alternative to the conventional approach of directly estimating the bispectrum. We apply our quadratic estimator to a DESI-like survey and forecast constraints on the overall amplitude of EP violation. Including mildly nonlinear scales in our reconstruction ($k_\\mathrm{max}\\simeq0.15\\, h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), we find that our estimator is competitive with the more exhaustive direct bispectrum approach. This means surveys like DESI can already benefit from the quadratic estimator approach.",

We study how the companion's spin controls this process, and the ensuing back-reaction on the magnitude and direction of the companion's spin vector. We find that higher spin suppresses the mass accretion rate but enhances the accretion-induced torques, driving spin-down and secular alignment of the companion's spin with the orbital plane. Collisionless DM accretion generically imprints a near-universal mass-spin correlation characterized by a spin-evolution parameter $s \\simeq 2.8$, much larger than is the case for typical astrophysical environments, and largely independent of the local DM density and the spike slope. The associated spin-down proceeds on astrophysically relevant timescales, thus observations of rapidly spinning IMRI companions would disfavor the presence of dense DM environments, providing constraints complementary to those arising from dynamical friction.",

Consequently, when standardized with increasing z, the average absolute magnitudes of Type 1a supernovae are artificially increased. This means that for a given apparent magnitude they are, on average, assigned larger distances than they actually are, creating the appearance of their recession with acceleration and requiring the introduction of the concept of antigravity (dark energy) to explain it. We also show that after standardization, Type 1a supernovae cease to be standard candles. We therefore argue that such a standardization is not suitable for measuring the distances to Type 1a supernovae, and hence the accelerating expansion of the Universe is called into question.",

Saha 2024) of using ANNs to infer cosmological density parameters by determining optimal architecture for varying synthetic Hubble data SNRs in estimating the density parameters $\\Omega_{m, 0}$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda, 0}$ across redshift values $z \\in [0, 1]$. To generate the synthetic data, this study randomly sampled initial free parameter values at $z=0$ from theoretically motivated priors and evolved them backwards using the first Friedmann Equation to generate clean $H(z)$ curves. Then, this paper adds realistic noise of high, normal, and low SNR by sampling relative uncertainties from a Gaussian KDE on 47 real data observations compiled by A. Bouali et al. (2023). In the end, this study found that a RNN that uses BiLSTM is the most effective for high and normal SNR data across four quantitative metrics. On the other hand, a combination of convolution and recurrent layers that uses GRU performed the best for low SNR data across the same four metrics. A comparison between the results of this paper's ANN predictions and those of ParamANN shows that all architectures tested in this paper regardless of training SNR are statistically consistent within 1 standard deviation of ParamANN. However, most ANN results are not statistically consistent within 3 standard deviations of Planck Collaboration et al.

However, at the (sub-)nanometer scale clusters with non-crystalline structures and significantly different properties are energetically favoured. For this reason, we study the thermodynamic stabilities of metal oxide clusters with generic stoichiometries of M$_2$O$_3$ and M$_3$O$_4$, where M represents a metal atom. With an upper size limit of 50 atoms, we consider clusters with sizes n=1$-$10 for (M$_2$O$_3$)$_n$, and n=1$-$7 for (M$_3$O$_4$)$_n$. The M$_2$O$_3$ clusters comprise alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$), Mg-rich pyroxene (MgSiO$_3$) and a size-limited sample of titanates (CaTiO$_3$), whereas the M$_3$O$_4$ clusters include spinel (MgAl$_2$O$_4$), Mg-rich olivine (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$) and calcium aluminates (CaAl$_2$O$_4$). We find that, apart from the alumina monomer, the aluminum-bearing clusters (Al$_2$O$_3$)$_n$, n=1$-$10, and (MgAl$_2$O$_4$)$_n$, n=1$-$7, are favoured over their silicate counterparts (MgSiO$_3$)$_n$, n=1$-$10 and (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$)$_n$, n=1$-$7. Also, we find that calcium aluminate clusters, CaAl$_2$O$_4$, are energetically more favourable than magnesium aluminate clusters, MgAl$_2$O$_4$. Furthermore, for a limited data set of (CaTiO$_3$)$_n$, n=1$-$2, clusters we find significantly larger stabilities than for the other considered (M$_2$O$_3$)$_n$ clusters, namely Al$_2$O$_3$ and MgSiO$_3$.

This consideration allows us to probe previously unexplored regions of the parameter space of dark matter-electron interactions.

        "abstract": "We investigate the stellar shape and size-mass relationship of X-ray selected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host galaxies using the high-angular resolution and deep sensitivity in the near-infrared of the COSMOS-Web JWST survey field. We present the rest-frame 1-$\\mu m$ size, stellar mass, Sersic index, axis-ratio, Gini-$M_{20}$ parameters of 690 moderate luminosity AGNs between redshift 0-3 and with stellar mass $\\log M_s\\sim 10.75$. We find that AGN host galaxies have an effective radius of 1-5 kpc, which is between star-forming (SFG) and quiescent galaxies (QGs) of the same stellar mass. AGN hosts have similar size-mass trends as SFG and QGs, being smaller at higher redshift for the same stellar mass. The slope of the size-mass relationship of AGN host galaxies is steeper than that of star-forming galaxies. Their rest-frame 1$\\mu m$ stellar morphology indicates a significant spheroidal component. We observed a low merger fraction (6%) in our sample as well as substructures similar to disks, bars, and spiral arms in the residual images, which are in tension with evolutionary pathways that require major mergers. However, it may also be due to the different timescales between mergers and AGN activity.",

        "abstract": "Investigating the multi-scale fragmentation of dense clumps into compact cores is essential for understanding the processes that govern the initial distribution of mass in stellar clusters and how high-mass stars ($>8~M_{\\odot}$) form. We present a catalog of the hierarchical continuum structure from 904 clumps observed in the ALMAGAL program, a high resolution ($0.15-0.8$\\arcsec) 1.38 mm Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large program targeting dense clumps capable of high-mass star formation throughout the Galactic disk. We use \\verb|astrodendro|, a dendrogram-based algorithm, on a uniform linear resolution (2000 au) version of the data to extract 5160 continuum structures with effective radii spanning $800-42000$ au and estimated masses between $~0.05-670~M_{\\odot}$. With our large sample, we statistically examine the difference in clump properties for regions with varying levels of hierarchical complexity. We find that clumps exhibiting the richest hierarchical morphology have distributions with higher dust temperatures, surface densities, luminosity-to-mass (\\textit{L/M}) ratios, and most massive core (MMC) masses, indicating that these regions tend to be at later evolutionary stages. We find a positive correlation between the mass of cores from the ALMAGAL core catalog and the surface density of their surrounding structures identified in this work. However, this correlation is weaker for cores in more evolved clumps, where lower mass cores can be found at higher local surface densities. This could indicate that some cores accrete mass less efficiently from the intra-clump reservoir than others, despite the total available mass increasing over time, a scenario that is congruent with a clump-fed core accretion model.",

By incorporating the latest cosmological datasets -- including the Planck2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), together with three independent Type Ia Supernova datasets, namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus sample -- we constrain the $\\Lambda w_2$DM, $ww_2$DM, and $w_0w_aw_2$DM models, which are constructed by replacing CDM with NSDM in the $\\Lambda $CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM models, respectively. We find that there is a preference for a negative DM EoS at more than the $3\\sigma$ confidence level for the data combinations CMB+DESI+Union3 and CMB+DESI+DESY5. Moreover, for all data combinations, replacing CDM with NSDM in the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM models significantly reduces the probability of violating the null energy condition. Furthermore, both $ww_2$DM and $w_0w_aw_2$DM are favored over $\\Lambda $CDM with a significance comparable to that of the $w_0w_a$CDM model.",

        "abstract": "Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars are ancient stars enriched in carbon and heavy elements. Some of these stars exhibit enhanced s-process and/or r-process elements, hence are classified as CEMP-s, CEMP-rs, or CEMP-r. This classification is challenging due to the limited availability of heavy element abundances, particularly among r-process elements. Heavy r-process elements such as terbium, holmium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, tantalum, and iridium have rarely been measured because their sensitive lines are located in the ultraviolet. However, they provide sensitive diagnostics of the s-, r-, and i- nucleosynthetic processes. In this work, we aim to obtain a secure classification of CEMP-s and -rs stars and investigate whether the i-process can account for the measured abundance patterns in CEMP-rs stars. We derive the abundance profiles, notably for twelve heavy r-elements, including, in some cases, tantalum, using high-resolution UVES spectra of seventeen CEMP-s and -rs stars. Based on indicators such as the [s/r] abundance ratio or the model-independent 'abundance distance', nine stars are confirmed as CEMP-rs and six as CEMP-s. The classification of two objects remains uncertain. The i-process satisfactorily reproduces the abundance patterns of CEMP-rs stars. However, larger samples are needed to confirm trends with metallicity and clarify how CEMP-rs stars differ from CEMP-s stars.",

        "abstract": "Supernova (SN) cosmology is based on the key assumption that the luminosity standardization process of Type Ia SNe remains invariant with progenitor age. However, direct and extensive age measurements of SN host galaxies reveal a significant (5.5{\\sigma}) correlation between standardized SN magnitude and progenitor age, which is expected to introduce a serious systematic bias with redshift in SN cosmology. This systematic bias is largely uncorrected by the commonly used mass-step correction, as progenitor age and host galaxy mass evolve very differently with redshift. After correcting for this age-bias as a function of redshift, the SN dataset aligns more closely with the w0waCDM model recently suggested by the DESI BAO project from a combined analysis using only BAO and CMB data. This result is further supported by an evolution-free test that uses only SNe from young, coeval host galaxies across the full redshift range. When the three cosmological probes (SNe, BAO, CMB) are combined, we find a significantly stronger (> 9{\\sigma}) tension with the {\\Lambda}CDM model than that reported in the DESI papers, suggesting a time-varying dark energy equation of state in a currently non-accelerating universe.",

KPI provides angular resolution within the diffraction limit by eliminating instrumental phase errors to first order. It has been successfully demonstrated to boost angular resolution on both space- and ground-based observatories, and is especially useful for enhancing space telescopes, as their diameters are smaller than the largest ground-based facilities. Here we present the first demonstration of KPI on JWST/MIRI data at 7.7 microns, 10 microns, and 15 microns. We generate contrast curves for 16 white dwarfs from the MIRI Exoplanets Orbiting White dwarfs (MEOW) Survey, finding significantly deeper contrast at small angular separations compared to traditional imaging with JWST/MIRI, down to within $\\lambda$/D. Additionally, we use our KPI setup to successfully recover four known companions orbiting white dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This analysis shows that at these wavelengths KPI can uniquely access the orbital parameter space where inward-migrating post-main-sequence giant exoplanets are now thought to exist. We discuss the prospects for applying KPI to a larger sample of white dwarfs observed with JWST, increasing the volume of directly imaged close-in post-main-sequence exoplanets.",

        "abstract": "We present a new method for aperture masking interferometric (AMI) imaging at near-IR wavelengths using radio astronomical techniques. The method starts with derivation of interferometric visibilities from a Fourier transform of the interferograms. An iterative joint optimization process is then employed, using self-calibration of the interferometric element-based complex voltage gains (i.e. electric fields), and CLEAN deconvolution to obtain the source structure. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method using the NIRISS aperture masking interferometer on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at 4.8~$\\mu$m and 3.8~$\\mu$m. Due to a number of effects (the large pixel size, charge migration, near-field optics), the method also requires an initial visibility-based amplitude normalization using observations of a well know point-source calibration star. We employ early science observations of the dusty binary Wolf-Rayet star WR137. Images with a dynamic range (peak/rms) of $\\sim 240$ on the target, and $\\sim 1000$ on the calibrator, are synthesized from a short integration. The self-calibration process determines the photon path-lengths through the optical system to each aperture using data on the target source itself, thereby representing an essentially 'real-time', precise wavefront error sensor. Four independent measures of the JWST mirror segment pistons (two wavelengths for two sources), agree to within 10~nm to 15~nm, comparable to the expected errors based on an analysis of closure phases on the calibrator star. Including a baseline-based phase correction improves the dynamic range of the final images by about 23\\%.",

        "abstract": "A long-lived central engine embedded in expanding supernova ejecta can alter the dynamics and observational signatures of the event, producing an unusually luminous, energetic, and/or rapidly-evolving transient. We use two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations to study the effect of a central energy source, varying the amount, rate, and isotropy of the energy deposition. We post-process the results with a time-dependent Monte Carlo radiation transport code to extract observational signatures. The engine excavates a bubble at the centre of the ejecta, which becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. Sufficiently powerful engines are able to break through the edge of the bubble and accelerate, shred, and compositionally mix the entire ejecta. The breakout of the engine-driven wind occurs at distinct rupture points, and the outflowing high-velocity gas may eventually give rise to radio emission. The dynamical impact of the engine leads to faster rising optical light curves, with photon escape facilitated by the faster expansion of the ejecta and the opening of low-density channels. For models with strong engines, the spectra are initially hot and featureless, but later evolve to resemble those of broad-line Ic supernovae. Under certain conditions, line emission from ionized, low-velocity material near the centre of the ejecta may be able to escape and produce narrow emission similar to that seen in interacting supernovae. We discuss how variability in the engine energy reservoir and injection rate could give rise to a heterogeneous set of events spanning multiple observational classes, including the fast blue optical transients, broad-line Ic supernovae, and superluminous supernovae.",

We use particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic reconnection and magnetized turbulence, coupled to polarization-sensitive radiative transfer code, to interpret IXPE observations of Mrk 421 during a high flux state recorded in December of 2023. To evaluate the fitness of the theoretical scenarios, we rely on a quantitative comparison the statistical properties of simulated and observed X-ray flux and polarization light curves using five evaluation metrics, rather than attempting to fit individual data points. We propose a multi-zone model where jet emission is represented as the sum of the radiative output of many independent cells, each described by a simulation run viewed at different orientations. Comparison of ensembles of simulated Stokes-parameter light curves with IXPE data shows that magnetic reconnection dominated models provide the best match to the observed X-ray flux and polarization dynamics. The optimal configuration corresponds to N = 15 emitting cells, which reproduces the observed amplitudes and timescales of the X-ray flux and polarization variations. Magnetized turbulence models underpredict both the flux and polarization variability. Our results indicate that a multi-zone, reconnection-powered emission scenario can describe the X-ray polarization behavior of Mrk 421 and establish a quantitative framework for testing theoretical models against IXPE observations of other high-synchrotron-peaked blazars.",

        "abstract": "Can a disk orbiting a central body be eccentric, when the disk feels its own self-gravity and is pressureless? Contradictory answers appear in the literature. We show that such a disk can be eccentric, but only if it has a sharply truncated edge: the surface density $\\Sigma$ must vanish at the edge, and the $\\Sigma$ profile must be sufficiently steep at the point where it vanishes. If either requirement is violated, an eccentric disturbance leaks out of the bulk of the disk into the low density edge region, and cannot return. An edge where $\\Sigma$ asymptotes to zero but never vanishes, as is often assumed for astrophysical disks, is insufficiently sharp. Similar results were shown by Hunter & Toomre (1969) for galactic warps. We demonstrate these results in three ways: by solving the eigenvalue equation for the eccentricity profile; by solving the initial value problem; and by analyzing a new and simple dispersion relation that is valid for any wavenumber, unlike WKB. As a byproduct, we show that softening the self-gravitational potential is not needed to model a flat disk, and we develop a softening-free algorithm to model the disk's Laplace-Lagrange-like equations. The algorithm is easy to implement and is more accurate than softening-based methods at a given resolution by many orders of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "Reflection of X-rays at the inner accretion disk around black holes imprints relativistically broadened features in the observed spectrum. Besides the black hole properties and the ionization and density of the accretion disk the features also depend on the location and geometry of the primary source of X-rays, often called the corona. We present a fast general relativistic model for spectral fitting of a radially extended, ring-like corona above the accretion disk. A commonly used model to explain observed X-ray reflection spectra is the lamp post, which assumes a point-like source on the rotational axis of the black hole. While often being able to explain the observations, this geometric model does not allow for a constraint on the radial size of the corona. We therefore extend the publicly available relativistic reflection model RELXILL by implementing a radially extended, ring-like primary source. With the new RELXILL model allowing us to vary the position of the primary source in two dimensions, we present simulated line profiles and spectra and discuss implications of data fitting compared to the lamp post model. We then apply this extended RELXILL model to XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data of the radio-quiet Seyfert-2 AGN ESO 033-G002. The new model describes the data well, and we are able to constrain the distance of the source to the black hole to be less than three gravitational radii, while the angular position of the source is poorly constrained. We show that a compact, radially extended corona close to the ISCO can explain the observed relativistic reflection equally well as the point-like lamp post corona. The model is made freely available to the community.",

The model is based on an extended $U(1)_X$ Froggatt-Nielsen--like mechanism, which naturally generates suppressed Yukawa couplings and realizes a Dirac seesaw for neutrino masses. An additional $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry stabilizes the dark sector, where chiral fermions charged under $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ serve as ADM candidates. Leptogenesis occurs through the out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy Dirac neutrinos, where the generated asymmetry is shared between the visible and dark sectors due to exact lepton-number conservation. The same suppression mechanism that explains the smallness of neutrino masses also determines the GeV-scale ADM mass. Numerical studies demonstrate that a fully asymmetric DM scenario is realized, consistent with relic abundance, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and direct detection constraints. This framework provides an experimentally testable connection between neutrino physics, dark matter, and baryogenesis within an anomaly-free setup.",

The thermal electron density, $n_{\\rm e}$, can also be divided into large-scale, diffuse, $\\langle n_{\\rm e} \\rangle$, and small-scale, clumpy, $\\delta n_{\\rm e}$, components. Estimating the properties of $b$ and $\\delta n_{\\rm e}$ from observations, even within the Milky Way, has long been challenging.

Here we present laboratory results from HANKA (High-resolution mass Analyzer for Nano-scale Kinetic Astro materials), a compact Orbitrap-based mass spectrometer developed towards the goal of a universal dust detector for space applications. Using infrared laser ablation and plasma formation under vacuum, we analyzed solid-state samples representative of Lunar, Martian, and Meteoritic material. The resulting mass spectra - recorded at resolving powers of R=60000 - reveal complex, but characteristic element mixtures. These results demonstrate the single event sensitivity of HANKA, and its mass resolution with the ability to resolve complex mass spectra and possibly differentiate geochemical signatures across planetary bodies. The dynamic range of 3-4 orders of magnitude enables even the detection of trace compounds. The minimalistic impact sampling approach enables fast, high-precision compositional mass analysis without complex sample preparation, making the instrument well-suited for orbital, surface, or flyby missions with expected dust impacts. Our system consists of an IR-laser system that simulates impacts of nano to micron sized solid-state dust and ice particles from space. It therefore allows to perform so called analogue experiments in the laboratory. We conclude that IR- laser pulses on a solid-state material are not only well suited for ice particle impact analogues but also a good analogue experiment for solid state particle impacts on a dust detector electrode in space. Moreover, the IR laser is employed only for an optimal analogue experiment simulating the impact event - it is not necessary in space on a spacecraft detecting space dust.",

Long studied in planetary systems, the same phenomenon should occur for stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in AGN disks. In this work, we derive simple analytic criteria describing when BH pairs are driven out of resonance, and use them to chart MMR stability across AGN parameter space, accounting for disruption from general-relativistic apsidal precession, hydrodynamic turbulence, and stellar stirring. Across plausible AGN disk models, we find three MBH mass regimes: (i) for $M/ M_\\odot\\gtrsim 10^{7.5}$, first order resonances are generically unstable; (ii) for $M/ M_\\odot\\lesssim 10^{6.5}$, stable MMRs are always present; (iii) for $10^{6.5}\\lesssim M / M_\\odot \\lesssim 10^{7.5}$, stability depends on disk mass flux, the summed mass of the orbiters, and the nuclear-cusp slope. When present, stable MMRs commonly occur between an inner anti-trap and an outer trap set by thermal torque, a region where embedded objects migrate outward in the disk. These results imply that high-mass AGN allow convergent migration to proceed to LVK-band mergers largely without resonant chains, whereas low/intermediate-mass AGN can host MMRs, with the potential to reshape merger pathways.",

Although the lamp-post model successfully explains the disk reflection component, it fails to address the origin of seed photons and the geometry of the hot corona, because this model simplistically treats the corona as a point-like source generating a cutoff powerlaw spectrum. In this paper, we make simulations on a possible physical realization of the lamp-post scenario: the shape of the scattering zone is set to be a cylinder, corresponding to the jet base near a BH. The source of seed photons in this system is assumed to be the multicolor blackbody radiation of the accretion disk. In our simulations, the Compton scattering process is simulated with a custom Monte Carlo program based on the Geant4 package and the disk reflection process is simulated with the xilconv model in XSPEC. Our simulation results have confirmed that the relativistic motion of the jet can weaken or even completely suppress the reflection of the accretion disk, and simultaneously, the Comptonization of disk photons in the jet can still make a major contribution to the observed X-ray spectrum in high energy range. We discuss the implications of our simulation results, in light of the recent observations of a very weak reflection component in the presence of a strong hard X-ray radiation from the outburst of Swift J1727.8-1613.",

        "abstract": "Bars are one of the most prominent galactic structures. The classical swing-amplification theory can qualitatively describe the spontaneous bar instability of stellar disks. Still, it cannot quantify the bar formation process or explain why some disk galaxies do not have a bar. Recent studies found that the bar formation timescale depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction of the host galaxy (dubbed as \"Fujii relation\"), but they only explored a limited parameter space, where the physical effects of Toomre $Q$ (local disk stability parameter) and disk scale height of the host galaxies are not fully explored. In this work, we check the robustness of the Fujii relation in a higher-dimensional parameter space of disk mass fraction, Toomre $Q$, and scale height. We find that the Fujii relation holds for disk galaxies with physically reasonable Toomre $Q$ and scale height. Furthermore, the bar formation timescale also approximately linearly depends on both Toomre $Q$ and scale height, with a more prolonged bar formation in a hotter or thicker disk. We propose an empirical relation to combine the dependency of the bar formation timescale on the three parameters. Based on the empirical relation and recent observations, we estimate that the bar formation timescale in pure stellar disks ranges from $0.20_{-0.06}^{+0.09}~\\mathrm{Gyr}$ to $12.20_{-2.80}^{+3.37}~\\mathrm{Gyr}$ or even significantly beyond the Hubble timescale in some extreme cases.",

With this motivation, we study the generation of the primordial magnetic field in the context of loop quantum cosmology (LQC). In LQC, inflation is preceded by a quantum bounce. In this work, we consider an electromagnetic field coupled to the background as a test field and study its evolution through the bounce and through the subsequent inflationary phase. We investigate the power spectra generated in LQC and show that it is scale-dependent. We study the power spectra with different initial conditions, discuss equivalent forms of coupling functions, investigate backreaction, and compute the amount of primordial magnetic field which can be measured today. We conclude the article with a summary and discussion of the results.",

        "abstract": "Polarized synchrotron emission from ultra-relativistic electrons spiraling the Galactic magnetic field has become one of the most relevant emissions in the Interstellar medium these last years due to the improvement in the quality of low-frequency observations. One of the recent experiments designed to explore this emission is the QUIJOTE experiment.   We aim to study the spatial variations of the synchrotron emission in the QUIJOTE MFI data, by dividing the sky into physically separated regions. For such task, we firstly use a novel component separation method based on artificial neural networks to clean the synchrotron maps. After training the network with simulations, we fit both $EE$ and $BB$ spectra by assuming a power-law model. Then, we give estimations for the index $\\alpha_{S}$, the amplitude, and the ratio between $B$ and $E$ amplitudes.   When analyzing the real data, we found a clear spatial variation of the synchrotron properties along the sky at 11 GHz, obtaining a steeper index in the Galactic plane of $\\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.1 \\pm 0.3$ and $\\alpha_{S}^{BB} = -3.1 \\pm 0.4$ and a flatter one at high Galactic latitudes of $\\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.05 \\pm 0.2$ and $\\alpha_{S}^{B} = -2.98 \\pm 0.27$. We found average values at all sky of $\\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.04 \\pm 0.21$ and $\\alpha_{S}^{BB} = -3.00 \\pm 0.34$. Furthermore, after obtaining an average value of $A_{S}^{EE} = 3.31 \\pm 0.08$ $\\mu K^{2}$ and $A_{S}^{BB} = 0.93 \\pm 0.02$ $\\mu K^{2}$, we estimate a ratio between $B$ and $E$ amplitudes of $A_{S}^{BB}/A_{S}^{EE} = 0.28 \\pm 0.08$.   Based on the results we conclude that, although neural networks seem to be valuable methods to apply on real ISM observations, combined analyses with Planck, WMAP and/or CBASS data are mandatory to reduce the contamination from QUIJOTE maps and then improve the accuracy of the estimations.",

        "abstract": "Photometric classification of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is critical for cosmological studies but remains difficult due to class imbalance and observational noise. While deep learning models have been explored, they are often resource-intensive and lack interpretability. We present a computationally efficient and interpretable classification framework that maintains high performance on imbalanced datasets. We emphasize the use of PR-AUC and F1-score as more informative metrics than ROC-AUC in severely imbalanced settings. Using an XGBoost ensemble optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, we classified light curves from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge (SPCC), comprising 21,318 events with a 3.19 imbalance ratio (non-Ia to Ia). Our model achieved a PR-AUC of $0.993^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, an F1-score of $0.923 \\pm 0.008$, and a ROC-AUC of $0.976 \\pm 0.004$, matching or exceeding deep learning performance on precision-recall trade-offs while using fewer resources. Despite slightly lower overall accuracy, our method balances false positives and false negatives, improving the efficiency of spectroscopic follow-up. We show that optimized ensemble models offer a reproducible and lightweight alternative to complex architectures, particularly for large-scale surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) where transparency and efficiency are essential.",

        "abstract": "The buoyancy stability properties of the ICM are modified because of the anisotropic transport of heat along the magnetic field lines. This feature gives rise to the MTI when the temperature gradient is aligned with the gravity, which occurs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Most previous linear analyses of the MTI adopted a local, Boussinesq approach. However, the conduction length, which sets the characteristic length scale of the MTI, might be a non-negligible fraction of the scale height in the ICM. We want to assess the impact of locality assumptions on the linear physics of the MTI. Another goal is to unveil the deeper connections between these global MTI modes and their MRI counterparts in accretion discs. Our third objective is to provide a new benchmark against which any numerical code implementing the Braginskii heat flux in spherical geometry can be tested. We perform a global linear analysis of the MTI in a spherical stratified model of the ICM. We use a combination of analytical results, corroborated by numerical results obtained with both a pseudo-spectral solver and IDEFIX, to better explain the physics of the global MTI modes. We obtain scaling laws and approximate expressions for the growth rates of the global modes. We show that the associated functions are confined within an inner region, limited by a turning point, where the mode is allowed to grow. The most unstable local MTI modes correspond to the portion of the global mode localised near the turning point. This phenomenology is similar to that of the global MRI modes. Finally, direct simulations successfully reproduce the global MTI modes and their growth rates, with errors smaller than 1%. Overall, this study provides us with new insights on the linear theory of the global MTI in the ICM, and a useful numerical test bench for any astrophysical fluid dynamics code embedding anisotropic heat flux.",

In this work, we investigate the influence of gravitational lensing on the SGWB, focusing on primordial black holes (PBHs) as potential lenses. Assuming PBHs as dark matter candidates with a broad cosmic distribution, we show that their lensing optical depth can be significantly enhanced, producing pronounced effects with relative deviations at the 10^-1 level. By systematically varying the PBH mass (M_PBH) and abundance (f_PBH), we demonstrate that the mass predominantly determines the frequency-dependent diffraction features of the spectrum, while the abundance primarily amplifies the overall lensing-induced deviation. Although the SGWB from binary black holes has not yet been observed, our analytical results provide theoretical insight into the possible imprint of lensing on its spectrum and suggest that future detections could offer a novel avenue to constrain dark matter scenarios.",

Moreover, the argument of pericentre, $\\omega$ could be fully circulating, or librating, with a limited range for $\\omega$. We use TSUNAMI, a regularised N-body code with 3.5PN corrections to identify four different orbital families: (i) circulating, (ii) small-amplitude and (iii) large-amplitude librating, and (iv) merging. We develop a new method to construct gravitational-wave waveforms using the quadrupole formula from the instantaneous acceleration in TSUNAMI. The four orbital families have distinct waveform phenomenologies, enabling them to be distinguished if observed in LISA. In particular, the properties of the tertiary companion can be inferred and serve as an independent mass measurement and distinguish field triple dynamics from galactic dynamics.",

        "title": "Investigating double bump air showers with the SKA-Low",
        "abstract": "Double-bump showers are a rare class of extensive air showers (EAS) predicted by Monte Carlo simulations. They occur when a high-energy secondary particle, the leading particle, travels significantly farther than the rest, creating a distinct double-peaked longitudinal profile. So far, no experiment has been able to directly detect these showers. The unique radio footprint of double-bump showers, characterized by multiple Cherenkov rings, provides a way to reconstruct longitudinal profiles from radio observations. With its dense antenna array and broad frequency range, the Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) will be the first experiment capable of detecting these features, offering a new opportunity to probe hadronic interactions and constrain particle cross sections at high energies.   In our analysis, we simulate the EAS using CORSIKA with the CoREAS plugin for radio. We developed a new method based on the Akaike information criterion to identify double bump showers in simulations by analyzing their longitudinal profiles. Then we investigate the prevalence of these double bump showers across different cosmic ray primary particles and various hadronic interaction models. We create a skeleton of the EAS which consists of all the particles with at least $1\\%$ of the primary energy, allowing us to confirm the leading particle hypothesis and track shower development following these particles. This will enable us to relate the attributes of the leading particle to measurable parameters. Depending on the exact shower properties, the radio footprint of a double bump shower can create a complex interference pattern, consisting of multiple rings. From this information, the longitudinal profiles can be extracted. SKA due to its dense antenna array and frequency range will be the first experiment able to observe these double bump showers in detail.",

Yet, because the compactness depends sensitively on the unknown equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter, the simple question: ``how compact can a neutron star be?'' remains unanswered. To address this question, we adopt a statistical approach and consider a large number of parameterised EOSs that satisfy all known constraints from nuclear theory, perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and astrophysical observations. Next, we conjecture that, for any given EOS, the maximum compactness is attained by the star with the maximum mass of the sequence of nonrotating configurations. While we can prove this conjecture for a rather large class of solutions, its general proof is still lacking. However, the evidence from all of the EOSs considered strongly indicates that it is true in general. Exploiting the conjecture, we can concentrate on the compactness of the maximum-mass stars and show that an upper limit appears for the maximum compactness and is given by $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm max} = 1/3$. Importantly, this upper limit is essentially independent of the stellar mass and a direct consequence of perturbative-QCD constraints.",

        "abstract": "Recently, IceCube reported neutrino emission from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. Using 13.1 years of IceCube data, we present a follow-up search for neutrino sources in the northern sky. NGC 1068 remains the most significant neutrino source among 110 preselected gamma-ray emitters while also being spatially compatible with the most significant location in the northern sky. Its energy spectrum is characterized by an unbroken power-law with spectral index $\\gamma = 3.4 \\pm 0.2$. Consistent with previous results, the observed neutrino flux exceeds its gamma-ray counterpart by at least two orders of magnitude. Motivated by this disparity and the high X-ray luminosity of the source, we selected 47 X-ray bright Seyfert galaxies from the Swift/BAT spectroscopic survey that were not included in the list of gamma-ray emitters. When testing this collection for neutrino emission, we observe a 3.3$\\sigma$ excess from an ensemble of 11 sources, with NGC 1068 excluded from the sample. Our results strengthen the evidence that X-ray bright cores of active galactic nuclei are neutrino emitters.",

        "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the system under study directly into the training of Neural Networks, ensuring solutions that respect physical laws. While effective for single-system problems, standard PINNs scale poorly to datasets containing many realizations of the same underlying physics with varying parameters. To address this limitation, we present a complementary approach by including auxiliary physically-redundant information in loss (APRIL), i.e. augment the standard supervised output-target loss with auxiliary terms which exploit exact physical redundancy relations among outputs. We mathematically demonstrate that these terms preserve the true physical minimum while reshaping the loss landscape, improving convergence toward physically consistent solutions. As a proof-of-concept, we benchmark APRIL on a fully-connected neural network for gravitational wave (GW) parameter estimation (PE). We use simulated, noise-free compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals, focusing on inspiral-frequency waveforms to recover the chirp mass $\\mathcal{M}$, the total mass $M_\\mathrm{tot}$, and symmetric mass ratio $\\eta$ of the binary. In this controlled setting, we show that APRIL achieves up to an order-of-magnitude improvement in test accuracy, especially for parameters that are otherwise difficult to learn. This method provides physically consistent learning for large multi-system datasets and is well suited for future GW analyses involving realistic noise and broader parameter ranges.",

        "abstract": "We present a detailed analysis of the Type-I (thermonuclear) X-ray bursts and eclipses observed from the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) EXO 0748--676 with AstroSat during the second known outburst of the source following a 16-year-long quiescence period. We detect three thermonuclear X-ray bursts, with two displaying simultaneous coverage in the soft X-rays. Simultaneous UV observations show evidence of reprocessed burst emissions in the far-ultraviolet band. The time-resolved spectral analysis reveals the photospheric radius expansion (PRE) nature for two bursts. We estimate the distance to the source to be $7.42\\pm0.53$ kpc using the peak flux of PRE. Notably, one of the bursts exhibited a secondary peak, $\\sim30$ s after the primary, particularly dominating in the softer X-rays, which reveals a correlation with the evolution of burst hotspot radius with no temperature dependence. The burst properties and corresponding flux values suggest that mixed H/He burning may have fueled the bursts. We also detect evidence of a soft excess during one burst, likely arising from the interaction of the burst photons with the surroundings. We uncover evidence for a hard X-ray deficit during the peak of all bursts and a hard lag of $\\sim4$ s, which can be attributed to the Compton cooling of the corona by the burst photons. We also probe the temporal evolution and the energy dependence of the eclipses, which offer insights into the binary environment. Our study helps gain deeper insight into the physics of burst ignition, flame propagation, the burst-accretion interaction, and the evolution of LMXBs.",

        "abstract": "The structural evolution of rotating protoneutron stars encodes essential information about their observable signatures, while microscopic properties provide complementary knowledge to advance observational investigations. Using a relativistic mean-field model with density-dependent couplings that account for temperature and particle composition, we investigate rotation, neutrino-emission-driven changes in angular momentum, particle distributions, temperature profiles, and sound speed to probe the internal dynamics of protoneutron star matter. Additionally, we track the evolution of macroscopic quantities such as energy distribution and gravitational mass and establish direct links between microphysics and global evolution. Extending the framework of Phys. Rev. D 112, 023007 (2025), which focuses on the global properties of rotating protoneutron star evolution, our results reveal that protoneutron star deformation and thermal evolution are governed by angular momentum, mass, and composition. Exotic matter (hyperons and $\\Delta$-resonances) and rapid rotation enhance deformation leading to a reduction in core temperature, whereas slowly rotating stars like PSR J0740$+$6620 remain nearly spherical. Our predicted equatorial radii for PSR J0740$+$6620, $13.0\\ \\mathrm{km} < R_e < 13.5\\ \\mathrm{km}$, are consistent with NICER measurements. These findings constrain the EoS, requiring a self-consistent treatment of rotation, mass-dependent compression, and composition-driven modeling to accurately model protoneutron star evolution in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics.",

The analysis employs an inversion formalism that relates the derivative of the distance modulus, $\\mu^{\\prime}(z)$, to the expansion history, allowing the data to determine the shape of $X(z)$ without assuming a specific equation--of--state or dark energy density parameterization.   A statistically optimized binning of the supernova sample (using 17 intervals following the Freedman--Diaconis criterion and 34 following Scott's rule) ensures a stable estimation of $\\mu^{\\prime}(z)$ and a controlled propagation of uncertainties throughout the inversion process.   The resulting $X(z)$ remains statistically consistent with a constant value within one standard deviation across the entire redshift range, showing no significant evidence for an evolving dark energy component at present. In a direct comparison among $\\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and the quadratic $X^2(z)$ parameterization -- where CPL and $X^2(z)$ each introduce two additional free parameters relative to $\\Lambda$CDM -- the CPL model attains the best statistical agreement with the data, albeit only marginally and strictly within this restricted model set.   These outcomes indicate that current observations are compatible with an almost constant dark energy density ($w \\simeq -1$), while the inversion framework remains sensitive to subtle departures that forthcoming high--precision surveys could resolve.",

        "abstract": "Bars are among the most prominent structures in disk galaxies. While the widely accepted swing-amplification theory provides a qualitative framework for their formation, the detailed physical processes remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have shown that the bar formation timescale in isolated galaxies depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction (the so-called \"Fujii relation\") and linearly on disk hotness and thickness. However, the influence of dark matter halo spin on bar formation has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we construct a suite of $N$-body models of disk and halo with varying disk mass fractions and amounts of random motions. By introducing prograde and retrograde spins in the dark matter halo, we explore how halo spin modifies the established empirical relations governing bar formation timescales. We find that these relations remain valid in both prograde and retrograde halo spin models. For rapid bar formation (short timescale), the effect of halo spin is nearly negligible. In contrast, for moderately slow bar formation, prograde (retrograde) halo spin tends to accelerate (suppress) bar onset. In cases of extremely slow bar formation, halo spin introduces a stronger but more stochastic influence. These trends might arise from the exchange of angular momentum between the stellar disk and the dark matter halo.",

        "abstract": "We performed N-body simulations of both individual cluster evolution and subcluster coalescence, demonstrating that cluster evolution and its outcomes strongly depend on the cluster formation process through comparisons of different gas expulsion modes and formation channels. The evolution of star clusters is significantly shaped by the gas expulsion mode, with faster expulsion producing greater mass loss. A broader degeneracy exists among initial cluster mass, gas expulsion timescale, and formation channel (monolithic vs. coalescence), which manifests in both evolutionary pathways and black hole production. In individual cluster simulations, slower gas expulsion enables progressively lower-mass clusters to retain central black holes within the tidal radius. As the gas expulsion mode transitions from fast to moderate to slow, the fraction of high-velocity stars decreases. Variations in gas expulsion mode and formation channel ultimately influence the stellar velocity distribution (within the tidal radius), and thus the expansion speed, which governs both cluster mass loss and black hole retention. Slowly expanding clusters are more likely to retain black holes and multiple systems, making them prime candidates for black hole searches with {\\it Gaia}. Our results highlight the crucial influence of early gas expulsion and cluster formation mechanisms on the dynamical evolution of star clusters and black hole production. These factors should be carefully incorporated into the initial conditions of N-body simulations, which necessarily rely on input from the star formation community.",

        "abstract": "Current optimization of ground-based Cherenkov telescopes arrays, also called Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) arrays, relies on brute-force human-driven approaches based on large simulations requiring both high amount of storage and long computation time. To explore the full phase space of telescope positioning of a given array even more simulations would be required. To optimize any array layout, we explore the possibility of developing a differential program with surrogate models of IACT arrays based on high-level instrument response functions (IRFs). The simulation time of a single telescope to a cosmic-ray event can be significantly reduced with its instrument response function or with generative models. However, it is not straight forward to model the array of telescopes from a set of single telescope surrogate models as the array is a stereoscopic imaging system. The complexity increases as well if the telescopes in the array are of different types. Additionally, the optimum of the array layout depends on the scientific use case. Current array layout optimization are obtained by minimizing the sensitivity of the array, a metric that depends on several high-level parameters such as the trigger efficiency, the energy and angular resolution, as well as the background rejection capability. The variety of telescopes types in IACT arrays, such as in the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), not only extends the sensitive energy range but also allows for cross-calibration of the instruments. Therefore, the optimal array layout is not only which minimizes sensitivity but also which reduces the systematic uncertainties. We focus on the optimization of a telescope array based on the SST-1M IACTs in Hanle, Ladakh India aiming at building a generic optimization pipeline for future ground-based cosmic-ray observatories",

One of the most serious backgrounds is due to the beta decays of unstable nuclei produced through muon breakup (spallation) of nuclei. This background is much more significant in JUNO compared to Super-Kamiokande due to JUNO's shallower depth and its lack of directional information. We present the first detailed theoretical calculations of spallation backgrounds in JUNO, showing the underlying physical processes and new ways to cut backgrounds while preserving signals. A key point is showing the importance of neutron tagging to identify hadronic showers, which are rare but produce almost all of the dangerous isotopes. With our new techniques, JUNO will be able to reduce deadtime (signal loss) by a factor of five and to reduce the running time needed to meet sensitivity goals by a factor of two. This will give JUNO greatly improved sensitivity to $^8$B and $hep$ solar neutrinos, as we will explore in a separate paper.",

The source was observed on October 17th, 2024, for approximately 350 ks of elapsed time, resulting in 171 ks of exposure. The source exhibited 22% variability with respect to the average count rate of 73.1 count/s during the observation, but remained in a spectrally soft state throughout. The time averaged spectrum was analyzed in conjunction with spectra extracted from periods of different count rate to check for variations in spectral components. The unprecedented energy resolution of 4.5 eV at 6 keV of XRISM/Resolve provides a detailed look at the shape and structure of the Fe emission line within the data, which shows a dual-peaked structure with an extended red-wing, and steep decline in the blue-wing of the line profile. Fits with the reflection model relxillNS are able to describe the structure in the Fe line region, and confirms previous results that the disk is close to the NS ($R_{\\rm in}$ = $1.02_{-0.01}^{+0.21}\\ R_{\\rm ISCO}$). These models also measure a low systemic inclination ($i=5^{\\circ}\\pm1^{\\circ}$), confirming prior X-ray and optical studies.

The size estimates of the clusters depend on the range of astrometric parameters and stellar magnitudes of the stars used for star counts. The mass spectra of two clusters differ significantly. NGC 188 shows a deficit of low-mass stars compared to M 67. In the halo region of NGC 188 (compared to the core region of the cluster), there is a relative excess of the low-mass stars (just as in the case of M 67) and a deficit of stars in the mass range from 0.66 to 0.9 solar masses. Comparison with the Hunt & Reffert samples showed that almost all the stars from these samples are contained among the stars we selected for counting. Moreover, the group probability of these stars belonging to clusters, estimated by the uniform background method, is higher than 60%. It is shown that the velocity dispersion of single stars (selected according to the `stellar magnitude -- color index' diagrams) is significantly smaller than the velocity dispersion of unresolved binary stars.",

To confirm the existence of this oscillation and precisely measure its period, I conducted extensive photometric observations of the object over 25 nights between 2022 and 2024. The total duration of these observations was 139 hr. The observations revealed the oscillation on each observation night. This oscillation was coherent throughout all the observations covering 18 months. Due to the large coverage of observations, I was able to determine the oscillation period with high precision. It was found to be 41.485867+\\-0.000026 min. The semi-amplitude of the oscillation was large, averaging 0.154(2) mag. The pulse profile of the oscillation did not change during the observations and followed a perfect sinusoidal pattern. With the high precision of the period, I created an ephemeris for the oscillation with a validity time of 30 years. This ephemeris can be used in future studies of changes in the oscillation period. Although short-period X-ray oscillations have not yet been detected in 1RXS J014549.6+514314, the high coherence of its 41-minute oscillation suggests that this object is most likely to be an intermediate polar.",

This geometry allows a unified treatment of gravitational and magnetic influences across weak to ultra-strong regimes. The analysis reveals a critical magnetic field strength above which no circular geodesics, timelike or null, can exist, establishing an upper magnetic bound for orbital motion. For subcritical fields, the photon circular orbit admits two real roots, the outer of which defines an outermost stable circular orbit (OSCO), complementing the conventional innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and confining stable motion within a finite radial domain. Exact expressions for the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies, and their associated precession rates, show substantial deviations from Kerr behavior, including a magnetically induced reversal of periastron precession within a finite radial range. For astrophysically relevant magnetic field strengths, the retrograde precession could be observable at large radii around astrophysical BHs, offering a potential diagnostic of large-scale magnetization. These findings highlight the geometric influence of magnetic curvature on strong-field dynamics, providing a self-consistent framework to interpret quasi-periodic oscillation phenomenology and potential magnetic imprints in precision timing observations of compact objects.",

        "abstract": "Cosmic birefringence is a hypothesized parity violation in electromagnetism that predicts a frequency-independent polarization rotation as light propagates. This would rotate the light from the Cosmic Microwave Background, producing an unexpected EB correlation. However, cosmic birefringence angle is degenerate with instrument polarization angle, and breaking this degeneracy requires an absolute polarization calibration. We calibrate the BICEP3 telescope (a 95GHz CMB polarimeter) by observing a rotating polarized source (RPS) with both the telescope and a small test receiver called the In-Situ Absolute Angle Calibrator (ISAAC).",

        "abstract": "Time-dependent phase screens in ground-based astronomy are typically simulated in the so-called frozen-screen approximation by establishing a static phase screen on a large pupil and dragging an aperture equivalent to the size of the actual input pupil across this oversized phase screen. The speed of this motion sweeping through the large phase screen is equivalent to a wind speed that changes the phase screen as a function of time.   The ergodic ansatz replaces this concept by constructing the structure function in a three-dimensional volume -- a sphere for reasons of computational efficiency -- , sampling phase screens by two-dimensional planar cuts through that volume, and dragging them along the surface normal at some speed which generates a video of a phase screen.   This manuscript addresses the linear algebra of populating the three-dimensional volume with phase screens of the von-Karman model of atmospheric turbulence.",

        "abstract": "While the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer proposals for next-generation, ground-based detectors promise vastly improved sensitivities to gravitational-wave signals, only joint observations are expected to enable the full scientific potential of these facilities, making timing and coordination between the efforts crucial to avoid missed opportunities. This study investigates the impact of long-term delays on the scientific capabilities of next-generation detector networks. We use the Fisher information formalism to simulate the performance of a set of detector networks for large, fiducial populations of binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and primordial black-hole binaries. Bootstrapping the simulated populations, we map the expected observation times required to reach a number of observations fulfilling scientific targets for key sensitivity and localization metrics across various network configurations. We also investigate the sensitivity to stochastic backgrounds. We find that purely sensitivity-driven metrics such as the signal-to-noise ratio are not strongly affected by delays between facilities. This is contrasted by the localization metrics, which are very sensitive to the number of detectors in the network and, by extension, to delayed observation campaigns for a detector. Effectively, delays in one detector behave like network-wide interruptions for the localization metrics for networks consisting of two next-generation facilities. We examine the impact of a supporting, current-generation detector such as LIGO India operating concurrently with next-generation facilities and find such an addition will greatly mitigate the negative effects of delays for localization metrics, with important consequences on multi-messenger science and stochastic searches.",

Here, we identify two potential opportunities for in-situ observations of 3I's ion tail by immersion, facilitated by the close alignment between the comet's hyperbolic trajectory with the ecliptic plane. During the period 30 October - 6 November 2025, it is predicted that Europa Clipper will potentially be immersed within the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS, providing the opportunity to detect the signatures of an interstellar comet's ion tail. Characteristic changes to the solar wind are also expected to be observed; a magnetic draping structure associated with the comet may be identifiable. It is further predicted that spacecraft Hera will possibly be immersed within the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS during the period 25 October - 1 November 2025.",

        "abstract": "The sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) from the Sun is one of the fascinating high energy phenomena closely related to the acceleration of protons to energies >300 MeV. Here we report on the solar cycle variation of SGRE events based on observations from Fermi's Large Area Telescope (LAT). This report covers solar cycles (SCs) 24 and 25 during which Fermi has been operating. Since SGRE events are closely related to solar energetic particle (SEP) events and interplanetary type II radio bursts caused by fast and wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs), we consider these phenomena as well. Many studies have shown that SC 25 is similar or slightly stronger than SC 24. The number of SEP events, GLE events, IP type II bursts, and fast and wide CMEs confirm this conclusion. However, the number of SGRE events observed by Fermi LAT has diminished significantly in SC 25 relative to SC 24. One of the issues has been the reduced coverage of the Sun since 2018 due to a mechanical problem with a solar array of the Fermi mission. By identifying the Fermi LAT gaps and the number of energetic events (fast and wide CMEs, interplanetary type II bursts) we conclude that about three times more SGRE events must have occurred than the 15 events observed by Fermi.",

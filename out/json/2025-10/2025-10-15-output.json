        "abstract": "Stellar feedback drives winds and outflows critical to the baryon cycles of low-mass galaxies whose shallow gravitational potential wells make them particularly susceptible to mass and metal loss through outflows. However, spatially resolved observations of stellar-feedback-driven outflows are limited due to their low-surface brightness and transient nature. We present the pilot of a larger multi-wavelength study searching for and quantifying stellar-feedback-driven winds and outflows on both spatially and globally resolved scales for a sample of 40 nearby low-mass galaxies. We search for outflow signatures in the star-forming dwarf galaxy NGC 3741 using new optical imaging and spectroscopy from the WIYN 3.5m telescope in conjunction with VLA 21cm observations and local star formation histories derived from resolved HST photometry. With this extensive dataset, we compare the neutral and ionized gas morphologies and kinematics, calculate mass-loading factors, and investigate spatial variations in the star formation history of NGC 3741. Though the galaxy is experiencing a burst in star formation, we find little evidence of strong outflows and calculate very low mass-loading factors. We suggest that, though star formation activity has increased dramatically in the central region of the galaxy over the last 40 Myr, the star formation rate is not high enough to produce a sufficient amount of high mass stars responsible for fueling outflows. Future analysis of the larger sample will allow us to explore how stellar feedback impacts mass loss on local scales, providing a deeper understanding of the interplay between stellar feedback and the interstellar medium in low-mass galaxies.",

        "abstract": "Observed rotation curves of dwarf galaxies exhibit significant diversity at fixed halo mass, challenging galaxy formation within the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. Previous cosmological galaxy formation simulations with baryonic physics fail to reproduce the full diversity of rotation curves, suggesting either that there is a flaw in baryonic feedback models, or that an alternative to CDM must be invoked. In this work, we use the Marvelous Massive Dwarf zoom-in simulations, a suite of high-resolution dwarf simulations with $M_{200}~\\sim 10^{10}-10^{11}$ ${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ and $M_{*}\\sim 10^{7}-10^{9}$ ${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$, designed to target the mass range where galaxy rotation curve diversity is maximized, i.e., between $V_{\\rm max} \\sim 70-100~ {\\rm km/s}$. We add to this a set of low-mass galaxies from the Marvel Dwarf Zoom Volumes to extend the galaxy mass range to lower values. Our fiducial star formation and feedback models produce simulated dwarfs with a broader range of rotation curve shapes, similar to observations. These are the first simulations that can both create dark matter cores via baryonic feedback, reproducing the slower rising rotation curves, while also allowing for compact galaxies and steeply rising rotation curves. Our simulated dwarfs also reproduce the observed size$-M_*$ relation, including scatter, producing both extended and compact dwarfs for the first time in simulated field dwarfs. We explore star formation and feedback models and conclude that previous simulations may have had feedback that was too strong to produce compact dwarfs.",

        "abstract": "The Gaia phase spiral is considered to work as a dynamical clock for dating past perturbations, but most of the previous studies neglected the disc's self-gravity, potentially biasing estimates of the phase spiral's excitation time. We aim to evaluate the impact of self-gravitating effects on the evolution of vertical phase spirals and to quantify the bias introduced in estimating their excitation time when such effects are ignored. We analysed a high-resolution, self-consistent $N$-body simulation of the MW-Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) system, alongside four test particle simulations in potentials contracted from the $N$-body snapshots. In each case, we estimated the winding time of phase spirals by measuring the slope of the density contrast in the vertical angle-frequency space. In test particle models, the phase spiral begins winding immediately after Sgr's pericentre passage, and the winding time closely tracks the true elapsed time since the Sgr's pericentre passage. Adding the DM wake yields only a modest (< 100 Myr) reduction of the winding time relative to Sgr alone. By contrast, the self-consistent $N$-body simulation exhibits an initial, coherent vertical oscillation lasting $\\gtrsim$ 300 Myr before a clear spiral forms, leading to systematic underestimation of excitation times. An analytical shearing-box model with self-gravity, developed by Widrow (2023), qualitatively reproduces this delay, supporting its origin in the disc's self-gravitating response. Assuming that self-gravity affects phase mixing in the MW to the same degree as the $N$-body model, the lag induced by self-gravity is estimated to be $\\sim$ 0.3 Gyr in the solar neighbourhood. Accounting for this delay revises the inferred age of the MW's observed phase spiral to $\\sim$0.6-1.2 Gyr, in better agreement with the Sgr's pericentre passage. (shortened for arXiv)",

        "abstract": "The attracting properties of gravity enable matter present in cores to collapse into stars with seven orders of magnitude change in space and time making modelling of star formation a challenging multi-scale process. To circumvent this scale problem stars are replaced by a sub-grid sink particle at a much larger scale. Sink particles are created above a threshold density and acquire mass and momentum through accretion. In models where binary star systems form and migrate to separations of a few cells, the accretion flow is unresolved and the relative accretion rate to the sink particles may become inaccurate. We introduce a new recipe for accretion onto binary sink particles that have overlapping accretion regions and implement an algorithm to track the angular momentum of sink particles as a proxy for the stellar spin. Our preferential binary accretion recipe uses a virtual binary sink particle for the purpose of accretion and redistribute the accreted mass onto the sink particles according to results from models investigating binary accretion in detail. This solves problems common to current algorithms in many codes: (i) accretion is not suppressed due to large velocity differences between gas and stars, when that velocity is only internal to the binary system, (ii) the accretion rates are smoother for the unresolved close binaries in eccentric orbits, and (iii) non-physical suppression of accretion onto the secondary sink particle when the primary dominates the potential is eliminated. We test our implementation by comparing simulations at increasing resolution until the binaries are resolved. While not perfect, it mitigates undesired properties of current algorithms and in particularly for global models of starforming regions. It may also be applied to other unresolved accreting binaries, such as compact objects in clusters and binary supermassive black holes in cosmological models.",

        "abstract": "The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts $z\\geq 9$ remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive ``heavy seeds'' must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars -- massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores -- believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to $\\geq 10^3\\,M_{\\odot}$ under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55$M_*$ -- five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.",

In particular, it has been shown that measurements of $S_8$ may show a statistically significant preference for the presence of elastic interactions. In this work we implement a specific realisation of these scenarios into an $N$-body code to explore the non-linear regime. We include two populations of particles to describe the interacting dark matter and the non-interacting baryons respectively. On linear scales we recover the suppression of structures obtained from Boltzmann codes, while non-linear scales exhibit an enhancement of the matter power. We find that fewer massive halos are formed at low redshift as a consequence of the elastic interaction and that dark matter halos are more compact than in the standard model. Furthermore, the ratio of dark matter and baryons density profiles is not constant. Finally, we corroborate that baryons efficiently cluster around dark matter halos so they provide good tracers of the dark matter velocity field despite the presence of the interaction. This shows that the interaction is not sufficiently strong as to disrupt virialised structures.",

Combined with MUSE spectroscopy, this enables robust classification of 4882 H II regions and separation of planetary nebulae and supernova remnants.

As we enter the era of very large imaging surveys, we are able to observe mergers extending to even lower masses and higher redshifts. Despite low-mass galaxies being more common, many previous merger identification methods were mostly calibrated for high-mass, local galaxies, which are easier to identify. To prepare for upcoming surveys, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using mock $\\textit{HST}$ CANDELS images at $z \\sim 1$ created from the IllustrisTNG50 cosmological simulation. We successfully identify galaxy mergers between a wide range of galaxies ($10^8M_\\odot < M_\\star 1:10$), achieving overall accuracy, purity, and completeness of $\\sim73\\%$. We show, for the first time, that a CNN trained on this diverse set of galaxies is capable of identifying both major and minor mergers, early and late stage mergers, as well as nonmerging galaxies, similar to that of networks trained at lower redshifts and/or higher masses (with accuracies ranging between $66-80\\%$) for the first time. We discuss the inherent limits of galaxy merger identification due to orientation angle and explore the confounding variables, such as star formation, to consider when applying to real data. This network enables the exploration of the impact of previously overlooked mergers of high mass ratio and low stellar masses on galaxy evolution in CANDELS, and can be expanded to surveys from $\\textit{JWST}$, Rubin, $\\textit{Roman}$, and $\\textit{Euclid}$.",

Recent research has determined the existence of AGB ``interlopers'', Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that pass close to or through star-forming regions that could be an alternative source of SLR enrichment to WR winds and supernovae. In this paper we study the effect of AGB interlopers on star-forming regions from a dynamical perspective, determining the enrichment amount of 26Al and 60Fe in disks within small clusters via numerous N-body simulations via a parameter space exploration. We find that enrichment is widespread from AGB stars, with efficient enrichment dependent on the time at which the interloper intersects the star-forming region. Velocity is a factor, though interlopers travelling at 30 km/s are capable of enriching many disks in a star-forming region assuming they encounter a disk when the interloper is more evolved.",

We seek to expand this list, by retrieving targets from a variety of sources and demonstrating that they present simultaneously a surface magnetic field signature and {\\delta} Scuti pulsations. Methods. We obtained archival and new spectropolarimetric datasets for a variety of known {\\delta} Scuti stars and analysed them using the Least Squares Deconvolution method to generate mean Stokes I and V profiles for each target, from which we can determine longitudinal magnetic field measurements. Additionally, we assessed photometric data from the TESS satellite to discern frequency peaks consistent with {\\delta} Scuti pulsations in known magnetic stars, and to identify magnetic candidates via rotational modulation. Results. We present a compiled list of all the confirmed magnetic {\\delta} Scuti stars discovered to date, containing 13 stars. The majority of this sample lies outside the usual {\\delta} Scuti instability strip in the H-R diagram, though we do not observe any specific correlations between magnetic field strength and various stellar parameters. This indicates that strong global magnetic fields play a fundamental role in shaping interior structure and processes. Magnetic fields thus must be included in realistic stellar models in order to more accurately predict structure and evolution. Conclusions. This work constitutes the largest database to date of strongly magnetic {\\delta} Scuti stars, one that will continue to grow over time with subsequent studies.",

We had calculated self-consistent hydrodynamic non-LTE models of the extended atmosphere, taking into account the balance of radial forces in the wind of the star. This allowed us to obtain reliable estimates of the fundamental parameters of Var 2. The derived luminosity ($L=6.5\\times10^{5}\\,L_\\odot$), current mass ($M_* \\approx23\\,M_\\odot$) and hydrogen abundance on the surface (${\\rm X}_{\\rm H}\\approx43\\%$) correspond well to a star with the initial mass $M_{\\rm init}\\approx50\\,M_\\odot$ and age $t_{\\rm age}\\approx5.0\\times10^6\\,$years that is evolving from lower temperatures towards the Wolf-Rayet stars. A study of dynamic properties of the wind showed that the shape of the wind velocity profile of the Var 2 is close to the one of OB supergiants. In contrast, for the obtained mass loss rate $\\dot{M}=2.1\\times10^{-5}\\,M_{\\odot}\\,\\text{yr}^{-1}$, the ratio of the wind momentum to the luminosity of Var 2 is in good agreement with the values found for late-WN stars. At the same time, Var 2 has a lower terminal wind velocity $v_\\infty\\approx230\\,$km$\\,$s$^{-1}$ compared to typical early-type supergiants or late-WN stars. Given the obtained age estimates, Var 2 could potentially have been ejected from the cluster associated with the nearest large star-forming region located at a distance of $\\sim100\\,$pc. However, statistical analysis of the projected distribution of stars in the vicinity of Var 2 suggests that this LBV could have formed in a local low-populated group.",

        "abstract": "Globular clusters (GCs) are fundamental for understanding the integrated light of old stellar populations and galaxy assembly processes. However, the role of hot, evolved stars, such as horizontal branch (HB), extreme HB, and blue stragglers, remains poorly constrained. These stars are often underrepresented or entirely excluded from stellar population models, despite their dominant contribution to the ultraviolet (UV) flux. Their presence can bias age estimates by mimicking the spectral signatures of younger populations. We examined the impact of evolved hot stars on the models using two well-studied Galactic GCs with high-quality Hubble Space Telescope photometry and integrated spectra from the International Ultraviolet Explorer and the Blanco Telescope. NGC 2808 and NGC 7089 (M 2) have extended HBs and are proxies for old stellar populations. Integrated spectra were constructed using a color magnitude diagram-based (CMD-based) method, matching observed stars to evolutionary phases and then to appropriate synthetic stellar libraries, enabling the HB morphology to be taken into account. Our findings show that the inclusion of evolved hot stars significantly improves the agreement between the model and observed spectra from the UV to the optical. The inclusion of these phases reduced the residuals in spectral comparisons. Our results reinforce that comprehensive stellar population models incorporating evolved hot components are essential to accurately date unresolved systems and to robustly trace formation histories of extragalactic galaxies.",

        "abstract": "Rest-frame optical observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a population of massive galaxies, exceeding $10^{10}$ solar masses, present less than a billion years after the Big Bang. The large stellar masses of these galaxies require an efficient conversion of baryons into stars, which may exceed theoretical expectations. However, the formation process of massive galaxies so early in the Universe's history is perplexing, as observations provide limited information to constrain their evolutionary pathways. Here, we present multi-wavelength observations of a galaxy complex consisting of at least five galaxies within a $\\sim10\\,{\\rm kpc}$ region, referred to as the \\quintet, using JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This system, located in the core of a galaxy protocluster at approximately 650 million years after the Big Bang, reveals the detailed physical processes involved in the formation of massive galaxies. These processes include a dynamic cycles of merger induced gas stripping, leading the temporal termination of star formation, and recycling of the stripped gas, with subsequent enhancement of star formation in other galaxies of the system, which is expected to evolve into massive galaxies that host more than $10^{10}$ solar masses of stars. The new observations represent the first comprehensive evidence of a massive galaxy formation through gas-rich, multiple-galaxy mergers induced by a dense protocluster environment in the $650\\,{\\rm Myrs}$ after the Big Bang. Our results suggest that the protocluster core is indeed one of the main drivers of efficient galaxy formation and rapid evolution in the early Universe, as predicted by theoretical studies.",

We follow previous work in splitting the additional terms to the hydrodynamical equations arising from the inclusion of radiation into terms to be integrated explicitly and implicitly, as the diffusion and coupling terms would impose very restrictive timestep criteria. We validate the scheme with standard test problems for radiation diffusion, matter-gas coupling, and radiative shocks from the literature. Our implementation is compatible with local timestepping, which often presents problems for implicit schemes, and we found very good agreement with results obtained with global timesteps. We present an example application of the new implementation to the collapse of a $1\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ molecular cloud core to a second Larson core modelled with radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. A high-velocity jet with v$_{\\rm rad}> 10\\, {\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ is self-consistently launched from the second core, nested within the first core, which produces a lower-velocity magnetorotational outflow. We observe magnetic field amplification up to more than $\\vert \\mathbf{B}\\vert_{\\rm max}>10^5$~G in the second core, which is surrounded by a small ($<0.5$~au) disk.

Previous studies of AGN in simulations have mainly focused on major interactions (i.e. between approximately equal mass galaxies), which produce the strongest inflows and, therefore, would be the most likely to trigger AGN activity. However, minor interactions are far more common and may still enhance accretion onto supermassive black holes. We present an analysis of post-merger galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation with stellar mass ratios of $\\mu>$1:100. We select post-mergers from the TNG50-1 simulation, from redshifts $0\\leq z< 1$, with stellar masses greater than $10^{10}M_{\\odot}$. We find an AGN excess in post-mergers with a stellar mass ratio as low as 1:40. The AGN excess is mass ratio and luminosity dependent, with 1.2-1.6 times more AGN found in post-mergers of 1:40$\\leq \\mu < $1:4 than in matched non-merger controls, and as many as 6 times more AGN found in major $\\mu \\geq$1:4 post-mergers. The AGN excess is long lived, between 500 Myr to 1 Gyr post-coalescence, across all of the mass ratio regimes. We demonstrate that the most luminous AGN in the simulation overwhelmingly occur in either post-mergers or pairs (with $\\mu \\geq $1:40). Finally, we demonstrate that mini mergers are likely to be overlooked in observational studies due to the weakness of features usually associated with recent merger activity, such as tidal streams and shells, making it challenging to completely account for merger-induced AGN activity even in deep galaxy surveys.",

The survey consists of deep spectroscopy for 153 targets observed over two pointings in the COSMOS field using the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly (MSA). We employ the three medium-resolution gratings G140M, G235M, and G395M, with exposure times of 13 hours, 3.2 hours, and 1.6 hours, respectively. We thus obtain full coverage of the 1-5 micron range, corresponding to the entire rest-frame optical wavelength range. The sample is carefully selected to provide a census of galaxies over the redshift range 1.7 < z < 3.5 above a redshift-dependent minimum stellar mass that ranges from 10^8.7 Msun to 10^9.3 Msun.The Blue Jay sample is representative of the entire galaxy population at these redshifts, without strong biases in color, star formation rate, or other properties. The sizes of massive galaxies at these redshifts are comparable to the NIRSpec shutters, which requires custom strategies for designing and reducing the observations. Since the standard A-B nod subtraction leads to flux self-subtraction, we construct a master background from empty shutters and subtract it from each of the science spectra. This, in turn, allows for the use of shorter slitlets consisting of only two shutters per galaxy instead of the usual three, with a substantial increase in the multiplexing of the NIRSpec MSA. We measure multi-band photometry using archival JWST and HST observations in two different ways: in a large elliptical aperture encompassing the entire source and from the exact area in the sky where the NIRSpec 1D spectrum is extracted. This enables self-consistent fits of spectroscopic and photometric data. The Blue Jay dataset, which we publicly release, represents the ideal sample for studying the stellar populations, neutral gas, and ionized gas in Cosmic Noon galaxies.",

The derived properties, including stellar-to-dust mass ratios of log(M_dust/M_star) ~ -3 to -2 at log(M_star/Msun) ~ 9, and dust-to-gas mass ratios of log(M_dust/M_gas) ~ -4 to -3 at 12+log(O/H) ~ 8, place these galaxies in an intermediate regime: higher than the very low ratios expected from supernova-driven dust production, but still below the levels attained once efficient grain growth dominates. These values indicate a transition phase of dust mass assembly, likely reflecting the onset of grain growth via metal accretion under accelerated evolution in the proto-cluster core.",

        "abstract": "The centers of massive elliptical galaxies exhibit a wide range in density profiles, from central cusps to resolved cores with order kiloparsec sizes. The cored ellipticals have been linked to the presence of supermassive black hole binaries that excavate their hosts' central stellar populations through three-body encounters. This connection between cores and black holes similarly operates in globular clusters, which also exhibit a bimodality in cored and core-collapsed architectures, respectively rich and depleted in stellar black holes. We report new estimates of the total black hole mass in 25 Galactic globular clusters based on a suite of roughly 150 Monte Carlo $N$-body simulations that fit observed surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles. We show that both globular clusters and massive elliptical galaxies individually exhibit strong correlations between total black hole mass ($M_\\bullet$) and core radius ($r_c$), and that these individual relations share a common power-law exponent to within $1\\sigma$ statistical precision: $M_\\bullet \\sim r_c^{1.3}$. The individual relations appear to be offset, suggesting swarms of stellar black holes scour globular cluster cores more efficiently than lone supermassive black holes scour the cores of massive ellipticals. Yet the shared basis of core scouring via black hole binaries hints at a unified $M_{\\bullet}-r_c$ connection across over 10 orders of magnitude in $M_\\bullet$. Our findings imply core radius measurements may offer a powerful observational constraint on black hole merger rates, from kilohertz sources detectable by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA formed in globular clusters to millihertz and nanohertz sources formed in massive elliptical galaxies.",

        "abstract": "We investigate galaxy populations in the HS1700+64 protocluster at $z=2.30$, characterized by two prominent linear filaments traced by spatially extended Ly$\\alpha$ blobs. We conducted a wide area mapping of emission line galaxies across the protocluster using the unique combination of three matched narrow-band filters, corresponding to Ly$\\alpha$, H$\\alpha$, and [OIII] emission lines at $z=2.30$. We find that H$\\alpha$ emitters are strongly clustered at the intersection of the filaments, suggesting a protocluster core. In contrast, Ly$\\alpha$ emitters tend to avoid the dense region and the filaments, likely due to the resonant scattering of Ly$\\alpha$ photons by HII gas and/or enhanced dust attenuation in galaxies associated with these structures. These findings support a scenario in which cold gas flows via filaments and to the core, fed by the cold-stream mode accretion in the early phase of protocluster assembly, and promoting active star formation there. Further evidence of the scenario comes from the alignment of massive, evolved galaxies in those filaments traced by distant red galaxies, suggesting accelerated galaxy growth in the filaments in the early Universe. This study clearly shows observationally that accelerated galaxy formation takes place not only in the protocluster core but also in the associated surrounding filamentary structure. This underscores the critical role of large-scale filaments in efficiently accumulating the cold gas and channeling it to galaxies therein and to the protocluster core. Such vigorous gas assembly facilitates star formation activity and drives galaxy growth in the early stage of cluster formation.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of high-redshift galaxies exhibiting a steep spectral UV downturn potentially indicative of two-photon continuum emission marks a turning point in our search for signatures of top-heavy star formation in the early Universe. We develop a photometric search method for identifying further nebular-dominated galaxy candidates, whose nebular continuum dominates over the starlight, due to the high ionising photon production efficiencies $\\xi_\\mathrm{ion}$ associated with massive star formation. We utilise the extensive medium-band imaging from JADES, which enables the identification of Balmer jumps across a wide range of redshifts ($1.5 < z  25.60$ to power the strong nebular continuum, together with a relatively non-blue UV slope indicating a lack of stellar continuum emission. Our nebular-dominated candidates, constituting ${\\sim}$10% of galaxies at $z \\sim 6$ (decreasing to ${\\sim}$3% at $z \\sim 2$, not completeness-corrected) are faint in the rest-frame optical (median $M_\\mathrm{opt} = -17.95$) with extreme line emission (median $\\mathrm{EW}_\\mathrm{H\\alpha,rest} = 1567$ \\AA, $\\mathrm{EW}_\\mathrm{[O\\ III] + H\\beta,rest} = 2244$ \\AA). However, hot H II region temperatures, collisionally-enhanced two-photon continuum emission, and strong UV lines are expected to accompany top-heavy star formation. Thus nebular-dominated galaxies do not necessarily exhibit the biggest Balmer jumps, nor the largest $\\xi_\\mathrm{ion, obs}$ or reddest UV slopes.

A subset of objects within AURORA have individually-determined nebular dust attenuation curves, which vary significantly in shape and normalization, resulting in reduced systematic uncertainty when constraining the total attenuation of H${\\alpha}$ luminosity, and thus the intrinsic ionizing output within our sample.

We test alternate dust prescriptions within this sample, and find that the total attenuation is lower when using the commonly-assumed Galactic extinction curve or when assuming that stellar attenuation is equal to nebular attenuation. We also find that assuming either of these alternate dust prescriptions can change the slope of relationships between ${\\xi}_{\\rm ion}$ and galaxy property, notably inducing a flat trend between ${\\xi}_{\\rm ion}$ and L$_{\\rm UV}$ within AURORA. While the novel nebular dust curves derived from AURORA spectroscopy reveal obscured ionizing photon production within star-forming galaxies at these redshifts, a more complete understanding of stellar attenuation is required to fully reduce dust systematics on ${\\xi}_{\\rm ion}$ for inclusion in reionization models.",

By combining SDSS and DESI Legacy Survey (DLS) images, we classified galaxies into 13 Hubble types, detected tidal features, categorized bars into different families, and estimated concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness. The depth of the DLS images allowed us to identify structural details that were not evident in the SDSS images, resulting in a more reliable classification. After correcting for volume completeness, we find a bimodal distribution in galaxy morphology, with peaks in S0 and Scd types, and a transition zone around S0a-Sa types. Bars are present in 54% of disc galaxies with inclinations < 70, following a bimodal trend with peaks in Sab-Sb and Scd-Sd types. Tidal structures are identified in ~13% of galaxies, particularly in massive E-Sa and low-mass Sdm-Irr galaxies. We derive the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and decompose it into each morphological type. Schechter functions accurately describe the latter, while a triple Schechter function describes the total GSMF, associating three characteristic masses with different galaxy types. The abundance of early-type galaxies remains constant at low masses; they are predominantly satellites. We confirm that later-type galaxies are generally younger, bluer, more star-forming, and less metal-rich compared to early-type galaxies. Additionally, we find evidence connecting morphology and stellar mass to the star formation history of galaxies. The MVM catalogue provides a robust dataset for investigating galaxy evolution, secular processes, and machine learning-based morphological classifications.",

We develop a comprehensive forward model based on the AbacusSummit cosmological simulations: mock galaxy group catalogues and synthetic kSZ maps are generated, together with a reconstructed peculiar velocity field that allows for photo-$z$ errors, redshift-space distortions, and survey masks. We investigate possible contamination from the cosmic infrared background (CIB), finding that CIB effects are subdominant to the kSZ signal in the relevant ACT frequency channel. We then predict the kSZ signal expected when stacking CMB temperature maps around groups, taking account of their estimated radial velocity. Comparing the model with observations, we are able to constrain the total baryon fraction within haloes, as well as their internal gas profiles. We find evidence for mass dependence of the halo baryon fraction within the virial radius.The gas fraction in massive groups is consistent with the universal baryon fraction, but low-mass groups ($10^{12.5} \\lesssim M\\,/h^{-1}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot \\lesssim 10^{14}$) are depleted to $0.21 \\pm 0.06$ times the universal baryon fraction. We find this low virial baryon fraction to be consistent with an extended gas profile, for which the total baryon content reaches the universal value well beyond the virial radius. This conclusion is consistent with previous analyses using X-ray, kSZ, and weak lensing, and plausibly reflects energetic feedback processes from the galaxies in these haloes.",

We assess the capability of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) to detect extragalactic sources in a heavily contaminated region of the Milky Way. We analyzed JWST/NIRCam wide-filter images of NGC 3324 with a customized implementation of SExtractor v2.28. Sources were detected in the F444W band, cross-matched with F090W and F200W, and validated against recent DAOPHOT point spread function (PSF) photometry. A refined sample was obtained through full width at half maximum (FWHM) - signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) criteria and visual inspection. We identified 102 galaxies across the JWST/NIRCam field of view. The magnitude (F444W) distribution is bimodal, with about 10% brighter than m_F444W < 15 mag and about 60% in the range 17 < m_F444W < 19 mag. Typical sizes are FWHM ~6.5 arcsec, from compact to extended systems with isophotal areas up to ~2000 pixels (~7.9 arcsec^2). Morphologies span from compact to spiral and lenticular systems, including a compact group at the eastern edge of the field. We also report the detection of \"transnebular galaxies\", visible through the most opaque regions of the molecular cloud. These results demonstrate the potential of JWST/NIRCam to probe extragalactic sources through highly obscured Galactic regions, opening new avenues for mapping large-scale structures across the ZoA.",

        "title": "Violent mergers revisited: The origin of the fastest stars in the Galaxy",
        "abstract": "Binary systems of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are one of the most promising candidates for the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae.   Violent mergers, where the primary white dwarf ignites when the secondary white dwarf smashes onto it while being disrupted on its last orbit, were the first proposed double degenerate merger scenario that ignites dynamically.   However, violent mergers likely contribute only a few per cent to the total Type Ia supernova rate and do not yield normal Type Ia supernova light curves.   Here we revisit the scenario, simulating a violent merger with better methods, and in particular a more accurate treatment of the detonation.   We find good agreement with previous simulations, with one critical difference. The secondary white dwarf, being disrupted and accelerated towards the primary white dwarf, and impacted by its explosion, does not fully burn. Its core survives as a bound object.   The explosion leaves behind a $0.16\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ carbon-oxygen white dwarf travelling $2800\\,\\mathrm{km/s}$, making it an excellent (and so far the only) candidate to explain the origin of the fastest observed hyper-velocity white dwarfs.   We also show that before the explosion, $5\\times10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ of material consisting predominantly of helium, carbon, and oxygen has already been ejected at velocities above $1000\\,\\mathrm{km/s}$.   Finally, we argue that if a violent merger made D6-1 and D6-3, and violent mergers require the most massive primary white dwarfs in binaries of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, there has to be a much larger population of white dwarf mergers with slightly lower-mass primary white dwarfs. Because of its size, this population can essentially only give rise to normal Type Ia supernovae, likely exploding via the quadruple detonation channel and leaving no bound object behind.",

        "abstract": "A significant number of hypervelocity stars with velocities between $1500-2500$ km/s have recently been observed. The only plausible explanation so far is that they have been produced through thermonuclear supernovae in white dwarf binaries. Since these stars are thought to be surviving donors of Type Ia supernovae, a surprising finding was that these stars are inflated, with radii an order of magnitude more than expected for Roche-lobe filling donors. Recent attempts at explaining them have combined 3-dimensional hydrodynamical supernova explosion simulations with 1-dimensional stellar modelling to explain the impact of supernova shocks on runaway white dwarfs. However, only the hottest and most compact of those runaway stars can so far marginally be reproduced by detailed models of runaways from supernova explosions. In this and a companion paper, we introduce a new \\textsc{Arepo} simulation of two massive CO white dwarfs that explode via a violent merger. There, the primary white dwarf ignites when the secondary is on its last orbit and plunging towards the primary. In the corresponding aftermath, the core of the secondary white dwarf of 0.16 M$_\\odot$, remains bound, moving at a velocity of $\\sim2800$ km/s. We map this object into MESA, and show that this runaway star can explain the observations of two hypervelocity stars that were dubbed D6-1 and D6-3 based on their original discovery motivated by the D6 scenario, though the violent merger scenario presented here is somewhat distinct from the D6 scenario.",

Lanthanide elements in particular have complex atomic structures with many IR transitions. Using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer simulations, we explore the impact of lanthanides on the IR spectra of KNe in the nebular phase, exploring a parameter space of ejecta mass and lanthanide fraction. We find that lanthanide impact is greater at higher densities, corresponding to earlier epochs and greater ejecta masses.

Based on our results, we argue that line opacity alone is likely insufficient to produce optically thick continua in the nebular phase, even in the case of lanthanide/actinide-rich ejecta, as our models are optically thin in the IR at these epochs. Given that lanthanide contributions are dominant below 4 $\\mu$m, we suggest that NIR observations best probe these elements, while MIR spectroscopy with \\textit{JWST} can reliably probe non-lanthanide emission even in relatively lanthanide-rich cases.",

This spectrum extends deeper into the UV (2029 < lambda < 2303 Angstroms) than previous studies of any CEMP-s star. When combined with previous UV and optical analysis, a total of 35 elements heavier than zinc (Z = 30) can be detected in HD 196944, and upper limits are available for nine other heavy elements. The abundances can be well fit by models of s-process nucleosynthesis operating in a low-mass companion star that evolved through the asymptotic giant branch phase and transferred heavy elements to HD 196944. This s-process event did not contribute substantially to the Ga, Ge, or As abundances (31 <= Z <= 33).

        "abstract": "Strong Ly$\\alpha$ emission observed from galaxies when the Universe is expected to be highly neutral is thought to trace large ionized regions that facilitate the transmission of Ly$\\alpha$ through the IGM. In this work, we use deep JWST Ly$\\alpha$ spectroscopy to constrain the size of a candidate ionized bubble at $z\\sim8.7$ in the EGS field, with a potential radius of $R_b=2$ physical Mpc (pMpc) or larger. We measure a photometric galaxy density and find that the volume is a factor of $\\sim2.5-3.6$ overdense, suggesting that there may be a large population of galaxies capable of creating an $R_b\\sim2$ pMpc bubble. Then, we infer the Ly$\\alpha$ transmission through the IGM for galaxies in the EGS volume using our deep spectroscopy, finding $\\mathcal{T}_{\\rm IGM}=0.26_{-0.14}^{+0.25}$. This transmission is consistent with the average at $z\\sim9$ and is mildly inconsistent with the transmission expected for an $R_b\\sim2$ pMpc bubble ($\\mathcal{T}_{\\rm IGM, 2{\\rm pMpc}}=0.53-0.63$), implying that such a large bubble is unlikely to be present. However, the photometric galaxy density in the EGS field is larger than in several other deep fields. This overdensity and the moderate Ly$\\alpha$ transmission may be consistent with smaller, $R_b\\sim0.5-1$ pMpc bubbles in EGS. This additionally motivates the need for future wider area Ly$\\alpha$ spectroscopy in EGS and other fields to obtain a more representative understanding of the sizes of ionized bubbles in the early stages of reionization, and the properties of the galaxies that create them.",

        "abstract": "We present JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam observations of the first optically selected off-nuclear tidal disruption event (TDE), AT 2024tvd, along with Keck/KCWI integral field unit spectroscopy. The spectra show broad H and He emission lines that are characteristic of a TDE. Stellar kinematics show smooth host-galaxy morphology and ordered bulge rotation, with no evidence of disturbances in velocity, dispersion, age or metallicity space. We construct the first quasi-simultaneous spectral-energy distribution (SED) from X-rays to infrared for a TDE and decompose it into three components: the TDE accretion flow, an unresolved nuclear star cluster (NSC), and heated dust emission. The accretion component implies a black hole mass of $\\log(M_\\bullet/M_\\odot) = 5.50\\pm 0.04$, an instantaneous super-Eddington accretion rate of $\\log (\\dot{M}/M_{\\odot} yr^{-1}) = -1.22 \\pm 0.04$, and an outer disk photosphere radius of $\\log(r_{out}/r_{g}) = 3.8 \\pm 0.1$. The dust emission is well described by a blackbody with $T_{dust} = 873\\pm 15$ K and peak luminosity $\\log (L_{dust}/erg$ $s^{-1}) = 40.80\\pm 0.01$, consistent with a dust echo near the sublimation radius. The SED is best fit when including additional stellar emission above the galaxy background at the TDE location, corresponding to $\\log(M_{\\star}/M_\\odot) = 7.97^{+0.16}_{-0.26}$, which we interpret as a massive NSC or an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy. These results support a minor-merger origin for the MBH responsible for the TDE over scenarios involving gravitational recoil or dynamical ejection from the nucleus.",

        "abstract": "Bow shocks generated from the interaction of winds from massive runaway stars with the interstellar medium have been shown to be prominent particle accelerators through recent $\\gamma$-ray and radio synchrotron observations. Here, we study particle acceleration from bow shocks by conducting 3D ideal cosmic ray magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the advection-diffusion limit. We use the Eulerian grid-based code FLASH, where stellar winds are injected through tabulated wind velocities and mass loss rates. We implement a gradient-based shock detection algorithm to resolve the shocked regions where the CRs are injected dynamically. Simulations are performed for different values of the CR diffusion coefficient and star velocities within an ISM-like environment up to 180 kyr to showcase the impact of dynamical CR injection on the early evolution of the wind-driven bow shock. With a simplified spectral model in post-processing, we calculate the expected upper limits of $\\gamma$-ray and synchrotron emission and compare with those from current observations. We observe that variations of CR diffusion rates can strongly dictate the morphology of the bow shock and the overall $\\gamma$-ray and radio synchrotron luminosity due to the balance between the CR injection efficiency and diffusion. Our results yield qualitatively comparable results with current observations, primarily attributed to the high-energy protons and electrons contributing to non-thermal emission from efficient acceleration at the forward shock through the approximations and assumptions in the injection algorithm. We conclude that CR acceleration, with varying CR diffusion rates, may substantially affect the morphology of wind-driven bow shocks and their non-thermal emission, if there is efficient particle acceleration in the forward shock.

To date, Perseus remains the only cluster that has been extensively mapped out to ~0.7$r_{2500}$ by XRISM/Resolve, while simultaneously offering sufficient spatial resolution to resolve gaseous substructures driven by mergers and AGN feedback. Our observations cover multiple radial directions and a broad dynamical range, enabling us to characterize the intracluster medium kinematics up to the scale of ~500 kpc. In the measurements, we detect high velocity dispersions ($\\simeq$300 km/s) in the eastern region of the cluster, corresponding to a nonthermal pressure fraction of $\\simeq$7-13%. The velocity field outside the AGN-dominant region can be effectively described by a single, large-scale kinematic driver based on the velocity structure function, which statistically favors an energy injection scale of at least a few hundred kpc. The estimated turbulent dissipation energy is comparable to the gravitational potential energy released by a recent merger, implying a significant role of turbulent cascade in the merger energy conversion. In the bulk velocity field, we observe a dipole-like pattern along the east-west direction with an amplitude of $\\simeq\\pm$200-300 km/s, indicating rotational motions induced by the recent merger event. This feature constrains the viewing direction to ~30$^\\circ$-50$^\\circ$ relative to the normal of the merger plane. Our hydrodynamic simulations suggest that Perseus has experienced at least two energetic mergers since redshift z~1, the latest associated with the radio galaxy IC310. This study showcases exciting scientific opportunities for future missions with high-resolution spectroscopic capabilities (e.g., HUBS, LEM, and NewAthena).",

        "abstract": "Understanding the dark matter (DM) halo environment in which galaxies that host active galactic nuclei (AGN) reside is a window into the nature of supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion. We apply halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling tools to interpret the angular cross-correlation functions between $1.5\\times10^6$ luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and our $\\sim28,500$ Hyper Suprime-Cam + Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer-selected (and $L_{6 \\mu m}$-limited) AGN to infer the halo properties of distinct quasar samples at physical scales $s>0.1\\,{\\rm Mpc}$, for $z\\in0.7-1.0$. We find that Type I (unobscured) and Type II (obscured) AGN cluster differently, both on small and large physical scales. The derived HODs imply that Type I AGN reside, on average, in substantially ($\\sim3\\times$) more massive halos ($M_h \\sim 10^{13.4} M_\\odot$) than Type II AGN ($M_h \\sim 10^{12.9} M_\\odot$) at $>5\\sigma$ significance. While Type II AGN show one-halo correlations similar to that of galaxies of their average halo mass, the Type I AGN intra-halo clustering signal is significantly shallower. We interpret this observation with HOD methods and find Type I AGN are significantly less likely ($f_{sat}\\sim0.05^{+1}_{-0.05}\\%$) to be found in satellite galaxies than Type II AGN. We find reddened + obscured AGN to have typical satellite fractions for their inferred average halo mass ($\\sim10^{13} M_\\odot$), with $f_{sat} \\sim 20^{+10}_{-5}\\%$. Taken together, these results pose a significant challenge to the strict unified AGN morphological model, and instead suggest that a quasar's spectral class is strongly correlated with its host galaxy's dark matter halo environment. These intriguing results have provided a more complex picture of the SMBH -- DM halo connection, and motivate future analyses of the intrinsic galaxy and accretion properties of AGN.",

In this work, we explore the possibility that the wind from a single powerful star, whether isolated or part of a cluster, can alone provide sufficient energy to generate gamma-ray emission detectable by current instruments. This scenario is particularly relevant given that a significant fraction of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are not found within clusters. To investigate this, we compiled a large sample of WR stars and ranked them based on their wind luminosity divided by the square of their distance, a proxy for their potential gamma-ray flux. We then searched for spatial coincidences between the most promising candidates and cataloged gamma-ray sources. This analysis leads us to propose associations between the stars WR14, WR110, WR111, and WR114 and several unidentified gamma-ray sources. These results suggest that WR stellar winds could represent a distinct and previously unrecognized population of gamma-ray emitters.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the properties of the first generation of galaxies is an ongoing challenge in observational astrophysics. While advances in deep field observation have led to the identification of large numbers of galaxies within the Epoch of Reionization, there are very few observed galaxies at this range that are sufficiently bright for high signal-to-noise spectroscopy. To this end, we analyse HST and ground-based photometry of five candidate strongly lensed galaxies, all projected behind the cores of massive clusters and with similarly red optical-NIR colors. All are characterized by a drop-off in their spectra between the near-infrared and optical wavelengths, corresponding to a Lyman-break that sets a lower bound on their redshifts. Using the open-source SED modeling software Prospector, we characterize two of these galaxies as high-z (z $\\sim$ 6.5-7) while the other three are low-z (z $\\sim$ 2) despite all five having similar apparent magnitudes at the observed wavelengths. We demonstrate that for the brightest dropout candidates we can distinguish high-z galaxies from red or dusty low-z galaxies using limited photometric data. The bright sources enable deep constraints on the dropout color which, in combination with flat continua measured in redder bands, require high-z solutions when searching the parameter space. At the time of writing this work significantly increases the number of m_AB < 24 galaxies at or above a redshift of 6, and provides a path forward for future analysis on the early era of galaxy formation",

        "abstract": "Massive stars (>8 $M_{\\odot}$) often undergo intense mass loss through winds or eruptive events in the final stages of their evolution, leading to the formation of a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). This material, expelled months to years before core collapse, shapes the pre-explosion environment and influences the early supernova (SN) emission. In particular, the interaction of the SN ejecta with the dense CSM can power an extended emission into the UV/optical bands, as seen in a growing fraction of type II SN. Recent events such as SN 2023ixf and SN 2024ggi confirm the relevance of dense environments and highlight the value of UV observations. Moreover, Fast Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs) may represent extreme cases of this interaction, possibly linked to more compact/massive CSM. In this work, we model the SN-CSM shock interaction in order to (i) estimate the maximum detection horizons and expected rates for future UV missions like ULTRASAT, and (ii) to estimate the intensity and expected rate of potential neutrino signals detectable by IceCube and KM3NeT. We then discuss the prospects for multi-messenger observations of such events in the near future.",

        "abstract": "We cannot understand planet formation without understanding disc evolutionary processes. However, there is currently ambiguity about how protoplanetary discs transport angular momentum (e.g. via viscosity or winds) and the relative contributions and interplay of different dispersal mechanisms. A key difficulty is that for any given system only a handful of disc parameters are usually available to constrain theoretical models. Recent observations of the d203-504 disc in Orion, have yielded values of the stellar accretion rate, external photoevaporative mass loss rate, stellar mass and the disc size and mass. In particular, having the combination of accretion rate and external photoevaporative rate is new. Using this unique combination of observables, we run a suite of disc evolution simulations to constrain which scenarios can match the observed values. We explore both viscous and MHD wind-driven discs, finding that they best match observations when the angular momentum transport $\\alpha$ parameter is $3\\times10^{-4}\\leq\\alpha_{\\nu}\\leq2\\times10^{-3}$ for viscous discs, and $2\\times10^{-3}\\leq\\alpha_{\\rm DW}\\leq10^{-2}$ for MHD wind-driven discs, consistent with other estimates in the literature. As well constraining the disc properties and evolution, the d203-504 disc allows us to define a new irradiation age, since in order to match observations, it was required that the disc had only just appeared in the extreme UV environment it is currently exposed to (a known issue for proplyds referred to as the proplyd lifetime problem). This indicates that it is either very young, i.e. <0.1 Myr, or it has been shielded until recently, which would have protected the planet forming reservoir and helped facilitate planet growth despite it now residing in a harsh UV environment.",

        "abstract": "Time-domain studies of mid-infrared and submillimeter variability have shown that at least half of protostars are variable. We present a statistical analysis of mid-infrared variability among young stellar objects (YSOs) in the distant, massive star-forming region W51 using NEOWISE data. From a catalog of 81 protostars, 527 disk objects, and 37,687 other sources including diskless pre-main sequence and evolved contaminants, we identified significant variability in the 3.4 um (W1) and 4.6 um (W2) bands. Because of W51's distance (~5.4 kpc) and extinction, the sample mainly includes intermediate- to high-mass YSOs (>2 Msun), unlike nearby regions dominated by low-mass stars. This mass bias may affect the observed variability. In W2, 11.1% of protostars, 7.6% of disk objects, and 0.6% of PMS+E sources showed secular variability, while 8.6%, 2.3%, and 0.5% showed stochastic variability; similar fractions were found in W1. The variability fraction and amplitude increase toward earlier stages. Protostars exhibit high-amplitude stochastic changes likely driven by dynamic accretion and extinction, whereas disk objects show more secular patterns-linear, curved, or periodic-possibly due to moderate accretion variations or disk geometry. Color-magnitude analysis shows that protostars generally redden as they brighten, consistent with enhanced dust emission or variable extinction, while disk objects show mixed trends: roughly balanced in W1 but more often bluer in W2, suggesting reduced extinction or hotspot modulation. These results highlight distinct mechanisms of variability across evolutionary stages and demonstrate that mid-infrared monitoring offers key insight into accretion and disk evolution in young stars.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of wide, eccentric Gaia neutron stars (NSs) in binaries with still evolving (likely main sequence) companions offers a new probe of mass transfer and pulsar recycling beyond the compact-binary regime. We model their origins and fates using population synthesis with POSYDON and detailed binary evolution with MESA, contrasting two limiting prescriptions at Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF): enforced circularization versus explicitly eccentric mass transfer. Our MESA setups include updated treatments of eccentric, non-conservative transfer, magnetic-braking torques for cool stars, and neutron-star spin evolution with accretion and dipole spindown. Under optimistic assumptions, isolated evolution yields Gaia-like systems at only <1.5% relative rates of NS-evolving companion binaries, yet absolute numbers remain consistent with detections for continuous star formation. Synthetic populations indicate that many canonical millisecond pulsar-white dwarf (WD) binaries arise from unstable mass transfer and common envelope recycling, whereas Gaia systems typically avoid common envelope and only undergo stable mass transfer. In the case of capping accretion onto the NS at the Eddington rate, circular RLOF keeps the donor's mass-loss rate hovering around the Eddington limit and sustained over long timescales. Eccentric mass transfer instead produces briefer bursty signatures where the donor's mass-loss rate can climb up to a thousand times higher than in the circular case. The eccentric channel then leaves wide, eccentric NS-helium WD binaries with only mild recycling, whereas the circular channel yields long-lived transfer, circular NS-WD binaries (helium or carbon-oxygen core), and fully recycled millisecond pulsars.",

Specifically, we focus on identifying broad Mg II absorption features that are blueshifted by several thousand kilometers per second and have previously been interpreted as arising from resonance line scattering of the SLSN continuum by rapidly expanding CSM ejected shortly before explosion. Utilizing high-quality spectra, we model the region around 2800A to characterize the Mg II line profiles, enabling us to either confirm their presence or place constraints on undetected CSM shells. We identify five objects in our sample that show broad Mg II absorption features consistent with the presence of CSM. While SN2018ibb, SN2020xga and SN2022xgc have been previously reported, we identify previously undiscovered CSM shells in DES15S2nr and DES16C3ggu. These shells were likely expelled approximately two and three months, respectively, before the explosion of their associated SNe, timescales consistent with late-stage mass-loss episodes. We do not find any correlations between the shell properties and the SN properties, except for a marginal correlation between the light curve decline time scale and the shell velocities. We further demonstrate that CSM configurations similar to the majority of the detected shells would have been observable in spectra with signal-to-noise >8 per resolution element, and that the lines from a shell are in general detectable except in the cases where the shell is either very geometrically and/or optically thin. Therefore, we conclude that the detection of CSM shells is not a selection effect, but may instead point to the existence of a subclass of SLSNe-I undergoing late-stage shell ejections shortly before explosion.",

Highly-excited lines of NH3 (17, 17), (18, 18) were detected in emission for the first time in the interstellar medium, with upper energy levels up to 3100 K. Mapping observations reveal widespread hot molecular gas traced by NH3 (13, 13) toward G0.66-0.13. The rotation temperatures of hot gas traced by NH3 exceed 400 K, which amounts to five percent of the total NH3 in the Galactic Center. Hot gas (>400 K) and warm gas (100-140 K) are found in distinct clumps, with the hot gas located at the interfacing regions between different warm clouds. The theory of intermittency in turbulence reproduces the complex temperature structure in the central molecular zone, especially the hot gas observed here. The results presented here demonstrate that turbulence heating dominates the heating of the molecular gas in the Central Molecular Zone, while the turbulence is induced by the shear-motion of molecular clouds under the gravitational potential of the nuclear star clusters and the supermassive black hole.

        "title": "Alleviating the $H_0$ tension through new interacting dark energy model in light of DESI DR2",
        "abstract": "The $H_0$ tension has become one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. The recent DESI DR2 data has shown a significant preference for dynamical dark energy, yet this has further exacerbated the $H_0$ tension. In this work, we explore the potential of new interacting dark energy models ($\\widetilde{\\Lambda}$CDM and $e\\widetilde{\\Lambda}$CDM) to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. We perform observational constraints using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescop, and type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus, as well as the SH0ES data. From our analysis, we observe the dynamical scale parameter of the cosmological constant, $\\delta_{\\Lambda} = -0.410^{+0.140}_{-0.120}$, in the $e\\widetilde{\\Lambda}$CDM model using the CMB+DESI+SH0ES data, which deviates from $\\Lambda$CDM at the $3.2\\sigma$ level. Due to the anti-correlation between $\\delta_{\\Lambda}$ and $H_0$, a negative $\\delta_{\\Lambda}$ results in a higher inferred $H_0$. Consequently, we obtain $H_0 = 71.90 \\pm 1.00~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the $H_0$ tension to $0.8\\sigma$. Even without SH0ES, the CMB+DESI data alone still alleviate the $H_0$ tension to $1.7\\sigma$. Overall, the $e\\widetilde{\\Lambda}$CDM model not only deviates from the $\\Lambda$CDM model but also demonstrates a significant capability to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.",

        "title": "Infrared spectral signatures of light r-process elements in kilonovae",
        "abstract": "A central question regarding neutron star mergers is whether they are able to produce all the r-process elements, from first to third peak. The high abundances of first-peak elements (atomic number $Z \\sim 31-40$) in the solar composition means they may dominate the ejecta mass in kilonovae. We here study theoretical infrared signatures of such light elements with spectral synthesis modelling. By combining state-of-the-art NLTE physics with new radiative and collisional data for these elements, we identify several promising diagnostic lines from Ge, As, Se, Br, Kr and Zr. The models give self-consistent line luminosities and indicate specific features that probe emission volumes at early phases ($\\sim$10d), the product of ion mass and electron density in late phases ($\\gtrsim$75d), and in some cases direct ionic masses at intermediate phases. Emission by [Se I] 5.03 \\mum\\ + [Se III] 4.55 \\mum\\ can produce satisfactory fits to the Spitzer photometry of AT2017gfo. However, the models show consistently that with a Kr/Te and Se/Te ratio following the solar r-process pattern, Kr + Se emission is dominant over Te for the blend at 2.1 \\mum\\ observed in both AT2017gfo and AT2023vfi. The somewhat better line profile fit with [Te III] may suggest that both AT2017gfo and AT2023vfi had a strongly sub-solar production of the light r-process elements. An alternative scenario could be that Kr + Se in an asymmetric morphological distribution generates the feature. Further JWST spectral data, in particular covering the so far unobserved $>5$ \\mum\\ region, holds promise to determine the light r-process production of kilonovae, and in particular whether the light elements are made in a slow disk wind or in a fast proto-NS outflow. We identify specific needs for further atomic data on recombination rates and collision strengths for $Z=31-40$ elements.",

We present the methodology and first results of its second data release, which includes major improvements in reduction, calibration, and analysis, providing deeper photometry, improved astrometry, and high-precision proper motions across the Nuclear Stellar Disk. Observations were obtained with VLT/HAWK-I in two epochs separated by seven years, using speckle holography and a ground-layer adaptive optics system. Proper motions were derived both relative, by aligning epochs within the survey, and absolute, by tying to the Gaia reference frame. The new release achieves photometry about one magnitude deeper and astrometry about ten times more precise than the first release. Proper motions reach an accuracy of about 0.5 mas/yr relative to Gaia. In the Arches field, our clustering analysis recovers the cluster with mean velocities consistent with HST-based results. The second data release of the GALACTICNUCLEUS survey provides the most precise ground-based proper motion catalogs of the Galactic Center to date, enabling studies of the Nuclear Stellar Disk, young star kinematics, and new stellar cluster detections.",

        "title": "The Gravitational Wave Memory from Binary Neutron Star Mergers",
        "abstract": "The gravitational wave signal produced by the merger of two compact objects includes both an oscillatory transient and a non-oscillatory part, the so-called memory effect. This produces a permanent displacement of test masses and has not yet been measured. We use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, including neutrinos, with several representative viable equations of state, to quantify--for the first time--the effects of the neutron star magnetic field, neutrino emission, and the ejected mass on the linear and nonlinear displacement memory in binary neutron star mergers. We find that the additional contributions due to the emission of electromagnetic radiation, neutrinos and baryonic ejecta can be ~15% of the total memory for moderate magnetic fields and up to ~50% for extreme magnetic fields. The memory is most affected by changes in the equation of state, the binary mass, and the magnetic field. In particular, for moderate premerger field strengths, the dominant impact of the electromagnetic field is the change in the gravitational wave luminosity, and the associated gravitational wave null memory, due to the unstable growth of the magnetic field and the resulting redistribution of angular momentum it induces in the remnant. While the direct electromagnetic contribution to the null memory is additive, the change in the gravitational wave null memory can--in some cases--result in the total memory being smaller than that from the corresponding nonmagnetized binary. Furthermore, in contrast to binary black hole mergers, the growth of the memory in binary neutron star mergers is extended due to the long emission timescale of electromagnetic fields, neutrinos, and ejecta. These results necessitate the consideration of the magnetic field, as well as the equation of state, for accurate parameter estimation in future analyses of gravitational wave memory data.",

        "abstract": "Jets and outflows are key components of low-mass star formation, regulating accretion and shaping the surrounding molecular clouds. These flows, traced by molecular species at (sub)millimeter wavelengths (e.g., CO, SiO, SO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH) and by atomic, ionized, and molecular lines in the infrared (e.g., H$_2$, [Fe II], [S I]), originate from protostellar accretion disks deeply embedded within dusty envelopes. Jets play a crucial role in removing angular momentum from the disk, thereby enabling continued mass accretion, while directly preserving a record of the protostar's outflow history and potentially providing indirect insights into its accretion history. Recent advances in high-resolution, high-sensitivity observations, particularly with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the infrared and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, have revolutionized studies of protostellar jets and outflows. These instruments provide complementary views of warm, shock-excited gas and cold molecular component of the jet-outflow system. In this review, we discuss the current status of observational studies that reveal detailed structures, kinematics, and chemical compositions of protostellar jets and outflows. Recent analyses of mass-loss rates, velocities, rotation, molecular abundances, and magnetic fields provide critical insights into jet launching mechanisms, disk evolution, and the potential formation of binary systems and planets. The synergy of JWST's infrared sensitivity and ALMA's high-resolution imaging is advancing our understanding of jets and outflows. Future large-scale, high-resolution surveys with these facilities are expected to drive major breakthroughs in outflow research.",

        "abstract": "Stellar rotation has long been recognized as important to the evolution of stars, by virtue of the chemical mixing it can induce and how it interacts with binary mass transfer. Binary interaction and rapid rotation are both common in massive stars and involve processes of angular momentum distribution and transport. An important question is how this angular momentum transport leads to the creation of two important classes of rapidly rotating massive stars, Be stars defined by disklike emission lines, and Bn stars defined by rotationally broadened absorption lines. A related question is what limits this rotation places on how conservative the mass transfer can be. Central to addressing these issues is knowledge of how close to rotational break-up stars can get before they produce a disk. Here we calculate diagnostics of this rotational criticality using the continuum polarization arising from a combination of rotational stellar distortion (i.e., oblateness) and redistribution of stellar flux (i.e., gravity darkening), and compare polarizations produced in the von Zeipel approximation with the approach of Espinosa Lara & Rieutard (ELR). Both produce similar photospheric polarizations that rise significantly in the far ultraviolet (FUV) for B stars, with a stronger signal in the von Zeipel case. For early main-sequence and subgiant stars, it reaches a maximum of ~1% at 140 nm for stars rotating at 98% of critical, when seen edge-on. Rotational rates above 80% critical result in polarizations of several tenths of a percent, at high inclination. These predicted stable signal strengths indicate that determinations of near-critical rotations in B stars could be achieved with future spectropolarimetric instrumentation that can reach deep into the FUV, such as CASSTOR, the Polstar mission concept, or the POLLUX detector design.",

The pair of ear structures resembles that of the SNRs Ia Kepler, SNR G299-2.9, and SNR G1.9+0.3, which earlier studies considered as SNIPs. The requirement that the explosion occurs within hundreds of thousands of years after the formation of the planetary nebula (by the second star to evolve) makes the core-degenerate scenario the most likely for Tycho. Several other possible scenarios lead to an SNIP, but they are unlikely for Tycho. The identification of Tycho as an SNIP leads to two general conclusions. (1) The fraction of SNIPs among normal SNe Ia is very large, ~70-90%. Namely, the vast majority of normal SNe Ia are SNIPs. (2) To accommodate the large fraction of SNIPs, the delay time distribution of normal SNe Ia includes not only the stellar evolution timescale (as usually assumed), but also includes pockets of younger stellar populations in galaxies without ongoing star formation; the SNIPs come from the younger stellar populations in galaxies.",

        "abstract": "Symbiotic stars are binary systems where a white dwarf (WD) accretes material from the wind of an evolved, late-type companion. X-ray-emitting symbiotic systems are classified into $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\delta$, and $\\beta/\\delta$ types, attributed to distinct physical mechanisms such as thermonuclear burning, wind interactions, and accretion-driven boundary layers. We present synthetic X-ray spectra derived from hydrodynamics simulations using the PHANTOM code, coupled with radiative-transfer calculations from SKIRT. We reproduce all X-ray spectral types by exploring different density structure of the accretion disc, the viewing angle, the plasma temperature of the boundary layer, and/or the presence of extended emission. The synthetic X-ray spectra consist of both absorbed and reflected components. In systems with massive, high-column density discs and viewing angles close to edge-on, the reflected continuum can dominate the X-ray emission. This effect is less pronounced in systems with low-mass, lower-column density discs. We explore i) systems going from $\\delta$ to $\\beta$ states, ii) $\\delta$-types that become $\\beta/\\delta$ sources, iii) the variability of the three Fe emission lines in the 6.0-7.0 energy range, and iv) the possible physical processes behind the $\\alpha$ sources. The observations from iconic symbiotic systems are discussed in line of the present models. Our framework offers predictive power for future X-ray monitoring and provides a path toward connecting accretion disc physics with observed spectral states in symbiotic binaries with accreting WDs.",

        "abstract": "Extensions of the Standard Model typically contain ``flaton fields\" defined as fields with large vacuum expectation values and almost flat potentials where scalar self-coupling is small or vanishes at tree level. Such potentials have been used to drive a secondary inflationary epoch after a primary phase of inflation, in what are called thermal inflation models. Although the primordial, high-scale inflationary epoch can solve the horizon and flatness problems, it does not always resolve difficulties associated with late-time relics produced in extensions of the Standard Model. These relics typically decay too late, injecting entropy and energetic particles that spoil successful predictions like Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. It is here that thermal inflation plays a crucial role: diluting unwanted relics by many orders of magnitude without erasing the baryon asymmetry or the large-scale structure set up by the earlier phase of inflation. The preferred scale for this phenomenon is in the range $10^6-10^8$ GeV if one considers supergravity, but without it, any scale above the EW scale is valid. We investigate a typical form of these potentials and determine what are the conditions for the potentials to develop a barrier such that when the flatons settle to the true minimum, the associated Gravitational Waves can be observed.",

        "abstract": "We present the discovery of a large gradual apparent fading event in optical and near-infrared wavelengths in a quasar at z=1.767 by a factor of 20-30 (in optical) over a period of ~20 years in the observed frame. This pronounced fading trend in brightness was first identified by comparing the magnitudes measured in the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) images with those in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images for ~3x10^4 quasars spectroscopically identified by SDSS. We performed follow-up observations, including optical imaging and spectroscopy as well as near-infrared imaging, with >4m-class telescopes such as Subaru, GTC, Keck, and SOAR telescopes. We combine these new data with the archival data to examine the variability behavior over ~20 years in detail and even the longer-term trend of the variability over ~70 years in the observed frame. We find that (i) the AGN component likely faded by a factor of ~50 from the early 2000s to 2023 and (ii) the observed brightness decline is best explained by a substantial decrease in accretion rate rather than time-varying line-of-sight dust obscuration. These findings are derived from multi-component (time-varying AGN + constant galaxy) spectral energy distribution fitting over multi-epochs, which is well consistent with the optical spectra. The Eddington ratio decreases by a factor of ~50, from ~0.4 to ~0.008 if we use the black hole mass measured with the SDSS spectrum, which could be highly uncertain because of the very large variability. The total brightness is dominated by the host galaxy in the rest-frame optical wavelength rather than the AGN as of 2023.",

In studies of magnetic transport, for example in magnetic diffusion, the conservation of energy and momentum is then neglected. In this paper, we investigate the details and the consistency of this so-called $\\textit{probe limit}$ in different parametric regimes of MHD plasmas. In the first part of the paper, our discussion explores the hydrodynamic (higher-form) theory of MHD. In the second part, we then explicitly test the probe limit by using a microscopic holographic (AdS/CFT) model of a strongly coupled plasma. In the process, we develop the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh EFT prescription for describing the bulk 2-form fields and their dual 1-form symmetries. Moreover, we find evidence of a phase transition at low temperatures and show that magnetic Hall transport can emerge as a consequence of background charge density that breaks the charge conjugation symmetry of the state. Finally, we discuss the implications for magnetic transport, with a particular view towards the dynamics of dense nuclear matter in neutron stars.",

The package provides a framework to implement and use the gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a numerical technique devised to study the nonlinear dynamics associated with inflationary gauge-field generation. The GEF has already been applied in the context of axion inflation, and with the GEFF package, one can build on these results. The GEFF gives users access to ready-to-use model files for two scenarios of axion inflation: pure axion inflation, with the inflaton coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector, and fermionic axion inflation, which assumes that the Standard Model (SM) hypercharge field is coupled to the inflaton, resulting in the production SM fermions via the Schwinger effect. The GEFF provides the user with methods to solve GEF equations, including an integrated error estimator and self-correction algorithm. Furthermore, users can implement their own GEF models, e.g., variations of axion inflation or related scenarios. The package also comes with tools to study the production of primordial gravitational waves induced by gauge fields. This is a starting guide for the GEFF, providing a high-level introduction to the GEF, installation instructions, and the basics for using this package.",

        "abstract": "The advent of Stage IV galaxy redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid marks the beginning of an era of precision cosmology, with one key objective being the detection of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG), potential signatures of inflationary physics. In particular, constraining the amplitude of local-type PNG, parameterised by $f_{\\rm NL}$, with $\\sigma_{f_{\\rm NL}} \\sim 1$, would provide a critical test of single versus multi-field inflation scenarios. While current large-scale structure and cosmic microwave background analyses have achieved $\\sigma_{f_{\\rm NL}} \\sim 5$-$9$, further improvements demand novel data compression strategies. We propose a hybrid estimator that hierarchically combines standard $2$-point and $3$-point statistics with a field-level neural summary, motivated by recent theoretical work that shows that such a combination is nearly optimal, disentangling primordial from late-time non-Gaussianity. We employ PatchNet, a convolutional neural network that extracts small-scale information from sub-volumes (patches) of the halo number density field while large-scale information is retained via the power spectrum and bispectrum. Using Quijote-PNG simulations, we evaluate the Fisher information of this combined estimator across various redshifts, halo mass cuts, and scale cuts. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of patch-based field-level compression always enhances constraints on $f_{\\rm NL}$, reaching gains of $30$-$45\\%$ at low $k_{\\rm max}$ ($\\sim 0.1 \\, h \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$), and capturing information beyond the bispectrum.

        "abstract": "Lensed gravitational wave (GW) events are expected to be powerful new probes of cosmology, contingent on redshift measurement by electromagnetic observations. Host galaxy identification is thus crucial but challenging due to poor localization by GW signal alone. In this paper, we show that the third-generation ground-based GW detectors will detect a population of lensed events with three or more detectable images (including the central one), each arriving at distinct times and Earth locations in the space, forming an effective network that reduces the typical localization area to $\\sim0.01$ deg$^2$. For at least $90\\%$ (or $50\\%$) of these events, the localization improves by more than a factor of $10$ (or $30$) comparing with unlensed cases. Such precise localization and multiple-image detections enable robust host-galaxy identification and, through lens modelling, further yield sub-arcsecond position. As ``dark lensed sirens\", these events become powerful probes of cosmological parameters. Using simulated lensed compact-binary mergers, we show that two-year or longer observations with third-generation GW detectors can measure the Hubble constant to $\\lesssim1$\\% precision via ``dark lensed sirens\" (even when relying solely on lensed stellar-mass binary black hole events), while simultaneously constraining other cosmological parameters. This approach will provide an independent, complementary avenue for measuring cosmological parameters.",

Recent proposals demonstrate that entangled qubits can achieve quadratic scaling of the signal in the number of qubits. In this work we expand on these proposals to analyze the bandwidth and scan rate performance of entangled qubit protocols across different error regimes. We find that the phase-based readout of entangled protocols preserves the search bandwidth independent of qubit number, in contrast to power-based detection schemes, thereby achieving a genuine scan-rate advantage. We derive coherence time and error rate requirements for qubit systems to realize this advantage. Applying our analysis to dark photon searches, we find that entangled states of approximately 100 qubits can become competitive with benchmark photon-counting cavity experiments for masses $\\gtrsim 30{-}40~\\mu{\\rm eV}$, provided sufficiently low error rates are achieved. The advantage increases at higher masses where cavity volume scaling becomes less favorable.",

Sensitive to the superhorizon inhomogeneites, they provide a unique way to probe physics at the largest scales, bypassing the limitations of cosmic variance inherent in the primary cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this work, we focus on the bubble collision predicted by the eternal inflation theory, which can leave distinct azimuthally symmetric patterns on the superhorizon scales, potentially detectable through the RDF and RQF. We present the first analytic expression of the RQF signal induced by bubble collision and validate it against numerical calculations performed with $\\texttt{RemoteField}$, a new public software tool we developed, finding excellent agreement between the two. Combining our new RQF calculation with the corresponding RDF signal calculated by prior work, we forecast the constraining power on bubble collision parameters using RDF/RQF reconstruction. We find that, for an CMB-S4-like and an LSST-like experiment, the RDF reconstruction can provide comparable constraining power as that from the primary CMB alone; and the RQF reconstruction can improve the constraining power by about an order of magnitude. We argue that these constraints can be improved further by including more RDF/RQF multipoles included and by using tomographic techniques to mitigate the standard $\\Lambda$CDM signal. We anticipate the framework we developed in this work to be broadly applicable to probe other superhorizon-scale physics, such as cosmic topology and domain walls.",

The main focus of the spectrograph will be to perform the initial screening and validation of exoplanetary candidates, in addition to study stellar variability. It will be possible to determine the physical properties of large exoplanets. The PLATOSpec blue-sensitive spectrograph, with a spectral range of 380 to 700\\,nm and a resolving power of R=70,000, is installed on the 1.5-m telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory in Chile. Initial results show that the radial-velocity limit given by the wavelength calibration is about 2-3 m/s. Tests on bright F-K main-sequence standard stars reveal a scatter of about 5 m/s over a few hours. The scatter over a few months is slightly higher. We demonstrate the capabilities of PLATOSpec on the mass determination of WASP-79 b and the spin-orbit alignment of WASP-62\\,b via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. We show its possible usage on variable star research as demonstrated on the false-positive exoplanetary candidate TIC 238060327, which is proven a binary star. Investigation of line-profile variations of the roAp star alpha Cir shows that PLATOSpec can also be used for the surface mapping.

This hierarchical data structure efficiently encodes and visualizes irregularly shaped regions of the sky, enabling applications such as cross-matching large astronomical catalogs. Aims. This study aims to explore potential enhancements to the MOC data structure by encapsulating textual descriptions and semantic embeddings into sky regions. Specifically, we introduce \"Textual MOCs\", in which textual content is encapsulated, and \"Semantic MOCs\" that transform textual content into semantic embeddings. These enhancements are designed to enable advanced operations such as similarity searches and complex queries and to integrate with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools. Method. We experimented with Textual MOCs by annotating detailed descriptions directly into the MOC sky regions, enriching the maps with contextual information suitable for interactive learning tools. For Semantic MOCs, we converted the textual content into semantic embeddings, numerical representations capturing textual meanings in multidimensional spaces, and stored them in high-dimensional vector databases optimized for efficient retrieval. Results. The implementation of Textual MOCs enhances user engagement by providing meaningful descriptions within sky regions. Semantic MOCs enable sophisticated query capabilities, such as similarity-based searches and context-aware data retrieval. Integration with multimodal generative AI systems allows for more accurate and contextually relevant interactions supporting both spatial, semantic and visual operations for advancing astronomical data analysis capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Robust extragalactic distance measurements are crucial for resolving the persistent discrepancy in the value of the Hubble constant (H$_0$)). Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), through their compact and variable broad-line regions (BLRs), enable the determination of geometric distances when reverberation mapping (RM) is combined with spectroastrometry(SA). We report results from a spectroscopic RM campaign (October 2022 to March 2023) targeting two narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, Mrk 1048 and Mrk 618, using 3.6-m DOT and 2-m HCT. High-cadence spectro-photometric monitoring was carried out using onboard instruments such as ADFOSC, HFOSC, and TANSPEC, resulting in well-sampled continuum and emission line light curves. The observed fractional variability ($F_{\\mathrm{var}}$) ranged from 4% to 14% across the $g$-band, H$\\beta$, and H$\\alpha$ light curves. The time lags were measured using the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF), PyI$^{2}$CCF, and \\textsc{JAVELIN} methods. In the rest frame, the ICCF analysis yields H$\\beta$ lags of $10.5^{+2.6}_{-4.2}$ days for Mrk 1048 and $10.2^{+3.4}_{-2.9}$ days for Mrk 618, while the corresponding H$\\alpha$ lags are $18.7^{+5.3}_{-5.4}$ and $14.4^{+4.6}_{-10.5}$ days, respectively. The emission-line widths, measured from the rms spectra using $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{line}}$, give virial black hole mass estimates of $6.3^{+2.0}_{-2.1} \\times 10^7\\,M_\\odot$ for Mrk 1048 and $1.2^{+0.4}_{-0.6} \\times 10^7\\,M_\\odot$ for Mrk 618. These results will serve as a basis for absolute geometric distance calibration when combined with VLTI/GRAVITY spectro-astrometric measurements, thereby contributing to the development of AGNs as standardizable cosmological probes.",

        "abstract": "Light scalar fields acquire isocurvature fluctuations during inflation. While these fluctuations could lead to interesting observable signatures at small scales, they are strongly constrained on large scales by cosmic microwave background observations. When the mass of the scalar is much lighter than the inflationary Hubble scale, $m\\ll H_I$, the spectrum of these fluctuations is flat. Meanwhile, if $m\\gg H_I$, the fluctuations are suppressed. A blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum which exhibits enhanced structure on small scales but avoids observational constraints on large scales therefore requires a coincidence of scales $m\\sim H_I$ for a free massive scalar. In this Letter, we show that if a scalar field possesses a nontrivial potential, its inflationary dynamics naturally cause this condition to be satisfied, and so a blue-tilted spectrum is generically expected for a large class of potentials. Specifically, if its potential $V$ exhibits a region which satisfies the slow-roll condition $V''<3H_I^2$, the scalar condensate will spend most of inflation close to the boundary of this region, so that its effective mass is typically close to $H_I$. The resulting blue tilt is inversely proportional to the number of $e$-folds of inflation prior to horizon crossing. If the scalar is long-lived, this mechanism leads to an attractor prediction for its relic abundance, which is insensitive to initial conditions of the scalar. In particular, a scalar field with quartic self-interactions can achieve the correct abundance to constitute all of the dark matter for a wide range of masses. We compute the relationship between the mass and self-coupling of quartic dark matter predicted by this mechanism.",

Despite the impressive accuracy of modern codes, the resulting waveforms inevitably contain numerical uncertainties. Quantifying these uncertainties is important, especially for studies probing subdominant or nonlinear effects around the merger and ringdown. This paper describes a flexible Gaussian-process model for the numerical uncertainties in all the spherical-harmonic waveform modes across a state-of-the-art catalog of NR waveforms and a highly efficient procedure for sampling the posteriors of quasinormal mode models without the need for expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo. The Gaussian-process model is used to define a likelihood function which allows many Bayesian data analysis techniques - already widely used in the analysis of experimental gravitational wave data - to be applied to NR waveforms as well. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by applying it to the analysis of quasinormal modes in Cauchy-characteristic evolved waveforms.",

We analysed seven years of timing data from the Arecibo 305-m radio telescope, the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The data processing accounted for dispersion measure variations and relativistic spin precession-induced profile evolution. We employed both DDFWHE and DDGR binary models to measure the spin parameters, kinematic parameters and orbital parameters. The timing campaign has resulted in the precise measurement of five post-Keplerian parameters, which yield very precise masses for the system and three tests of general relativity. One of these is the second most precise test of the radiative properties of gravity to date: the intrinsic orbital decay, $\\dot{P}_{\\rm b,int}=-1.8288(16)\\times10^{-12}\\rm\\,s\\,s^{-1}$, represents $1.00005(91)$ of the GR prediction, indicating that the theory has passed this stringent test. The other two tests, of the Shapiro delay parameters, have precisions of 6\\% and 5\\% respectively; this is caused by the moderate orbital inclination of the system, $\\sim 74^{\\circ}$; the measurements of the Shapiro delay parameters also agree with the GR predictions. Additionally, we analysed the higher-order contributions of $\\dot{\\omega}$, including the Lense-Thirring contribution. Both the second post-Newtonian and the Lense-Thirring contributions are larger than the current uncertainty of $\\dot{\\omega}$ ($\\delta\\dot{\\omega}=4\\times10^{-4}\\,\\rm deg\\,yr^{-1}$), leading to the higher-order correction for the total mass.",

These observations unveil the scattered light from this unusually large disk (~14\", or ~4200 au at 300 pc) in remarkable detail, revealing a rich tapestry of substructure, including brightness asymmetries and signatures of dynamical activity. Extended filaments are detected extending ~10\" from the northern edges of both nebulae, while no comparable southern features are observed. In addition to large-scale asymmetries, the disk exhibits prominent wispy features that extend well above the midplane and are visible in all filters, suggesting a complex, possibly turbulent outer disk atmosphere shaped by infall, dynamical stirring, or gravitational instability. The central dark lane narrows from optical to near-IR wavelengths, and high-resolution millimeter data reveal compact midplane emission. Although our radiative transfer simulations show that the current data cannot yet distinguish between dust-settling and no-settling scenarios, they underscore the need for deeper observations of this unique system. IRAS 23077+6707 thus represents a rare and valuable laboratory for studying the vertical structure, asymmetries, and evolutionary state of protoplanetary disks.",

In most cases, the location of particle acceleration can be roughly identified by combining high spatial and temporal resolution data from multiple instruments across a broad frequency range. In almost all cases, these nonthermal particles are associated with quiescent active regions, flares, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Only recently, some evidence of the existence of nonthermal electrons at locations outside these well-accepted regions has been found. Here, we report for the first time multiple cases of transient nonthermal emissions, in the heliocentric range of $\\sim 3-7R_\\odot$, which do not have any obvious counterparts in other wavebands, like white-light and extreme ultra-violet. These detections were made possible by the regular availability of high dynamic range low-frequency radio images from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory's Long Wavelength Array. While earlier detections of nonthermal emissions at these high heliocentric distances often had comparable extensions in the plane-of-sky, they were primarily been associated with radio CMEs, unlike the cases reported here. Thus, these results add on to the evidence that the middle corona is extremely dynamic and contains a population of nonthermal electrons, which is only becoming visible with high dynamic range low-frequency radio images.",

Here we propose three novel phenomenological tests of these theories. We first consider the collision of cosmic rays with ambient protons, electrons and photons in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), finding that high-energy neutrino data from the blazar TXS 0506+056 places a constraint on the fundamental scale of gravity of $M_f \\gtrsim 0.3$ TeV, and future high-energy neutrino data could raise this bound to $M_f \\gtrsim 200$ TeV. We then point out that collisions of pairs of cosmic rays could occur at a sizable rate in AGN where the accelerated cosmic rays are not collimated, or on supermassive black hole binaries. This consideration could potentially let us test unprecedented large fundamental scales of $M_f \\gtrsim 2$ PeV. We further compute the corresponding thermal neutrino emission arising from the Hawking evaporation of black holes produced in cosmic ray collisions, finding a spectrum that clearly differs from that expected in meson decays. Finally, we speculate with an scenario which would produce high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray emission from regions in the sky where no multi-wavelength counterparts would be expected, via graviton propagation from a different brane, which then decays in our Universe.",

Yet in the study of Hawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often introduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is generically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We revisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four representative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case $\\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation. We compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter can be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A crucial role is played by the sign of the term $\\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in Schwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal coupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier. For the D'Ambrosio-Rovelli case with large negative $\\xi$, the low-energy emission spectrum is enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude, since $\\xi fR<0$ throughout the space-time, leading to a deep potential well which broadens the transmissive window. The deviations we find can be particularly relevant in the case where primordial RBHs are dark matter candidates, given the impact of the non-minimal coupling on their evaporation history.",

Our results on quantitative metrics are competitive to other state-of-the-art image reconstruction algorithms. As an algorithm that does not require finely hand-tuned hyperparameters, this method offers a relatively simple and reproducible calibration-independent imaging solution for very-long baseline interferometry, which ultimately enhances the reliability of sparse VLBI imaging results.",

        "abstract": "Polar fields at the minimum of a sunspot cycle -- which are a manifestation of the radial component of the Sun's poloidal field -- are deemed to be the best indicator of the strength of the toroidal component, and hence the amplitude of the future sunspot cycle. However, the Sun's polar magnetic fields are difficult to constrain with ground-based or space-based observations from near the plane-of-ecliptic. In this context, polar filaments -- dark, elongated structures that overlie polarity inversion lines -- are known to offer critical insights into solar polar field dynamics. Through investigations of the long-term evolution of polar filament areas and length acquired from the Meudon Observatory and complimentary solar surface flux transport simulations, here we establish the common physical foundation connecting the Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo mechanism of solar polar field reversal and build-up with the origin and evolution of polar filaments. We discover a new relationship connecting the residual filament area of adjacent solar cycles with the amplitude of the next sunspot cycle -- which can serve as a new tool for solar cycle forecasts -- advancing the forecast window to earlier than polar field based precursors. We conclude that polar filament properties encapsulate the physics of interaction of the poloidal magnetic field of the previous and current sunspot cycles, the resultant of which is the net poloidal magnetic field at the end of the current cycle, thus encoding as a precursor the strength of the upcoming solar cycle.",

Inspired by the recent success of Chaplygin gas models in explaining dark energy, we consider a background fluid composed of baryonic matter, radiation, and a family of Chaplygin gas variants namely Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG), Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG), and Variable Chaplygin Gas (VCG). We constrain these models with three recent observational datasets: Observational Hubble Data (OHD), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO) data. For the QSO dataset, we propose an analytical expression for errors in comoving distance to circumvent the reliance on Monte Carlo simulations. Using kinematic diagnostics such as the deceleration and jerk parameters and Om diagnostic, we assess deviations of the proposed models from $\\Lambda$CDM. Our joint analysis of the three datasets reveals that the transition redshift from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion of the universe for the GCG, MCG and VCG models is $0.620^{+0.018}_{-0.017}$, $0.537^{+0.017}_{-0.017}$ and $0.470^{+0.012}_{-0.012}$ respectively, indicating a departure from $\\Lambda$CDM.",

Prime-Cam will use kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) sensitive to multiple frequency bands spanning 280--850 GHz. With over 100,000 sensors under development, these KID arrays will soon form the largest submillimeter focal plane ever built. With fixed microwave tones probing amplitude and phase modulations in the KIDs due to incoming radiation, challenges arise in determining the optimal readout settings, especially under varying atmospheric loading. Realizing the science goals of FYST requires operating the detectors at optimal performance and determining accurate responsivities, which depend on readout tone placement and power. To address these challenges, we present laboratory measurements of sample pixels from the 280 GHz TiN and Al arrays using a blackbody cold load to simulate observing conditions. These measurements probe detector responsivity and noise across varying optical loading, tone power, and tone placement, providing the foundation to guide in situ calibration and operation of the $>$100,000 KIDs. We characterize detector sensitivity via the Noise Equivalent Power (NEP) as a function of readout tone power and placement, and measure the impact of detuning due to varying optical power on the NEP. Our test setup and methodology will inform the commissioning of Prime-Cam, in situ detector calibration procedures, the cadence of probe tone resetting, and potential design refinements for future arrays, supporting FYST's planned first light in 2026.",

Under different field orientations, variations of the PA rotation with parameters and the PA rotation spectra are studied. We find that the conclusions obtained in our previous works are almost independent of the field orientations. The area of the parameter space with $\\Delta$PA $>10^\\circ$ will shrink as the value of field orientation ($\\delta$) increases for $0^\\circ<\\delta<90^\\circ$.

We find a characteristic $e$-folding radius of $593.7\\pm14.8$ km for Ni and $841.0\\pm15.4$ km for CN; this suggests that the Ni emission is more centrally concentrated in the nucleus of the comet and favors hypotheses involving easily dissociated species such as metal carbonyls or metal-polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbon molecules.

The oscillations occur in the time intervals without detected flares or eruptions. Simultaneously, near the Northern footpoint of the oscillating loop, we detect a $49.6 \\pm 5.0$-min periodic variation of the average projected photospheric magnetic field observed with SDO/HMI. The shorter-period decayless oscillation is attributed to the eigen-mode, standing kink oscillation of the loop, while the longer-period oscillation may be the oscillatory motion caused by the periodic footpoint driver. The photospheric long-period process can also drive the short-period, eigen oscillation of the loop via the self-oscillatory, \\lq\\lq violin\\rq\\rq\\, mechanism, in which a transverse oscillation is excited by an external quasi-steady flow.

        "abstract": "Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) cause Forbush Decreases (FDs) effects, which are local decreases in background galactic cosmic rays (GCR). Even though FDs can be observed with simple particle instruments, their amplitude and shape provide physical profiles of passing ICMEs. However, in some cases, previous statistical studies of the heliocentric distance dependence of FD changes associated with ICME propagation have found no strong correlation. We need the criteria for evaluating the relationship between ICMEs structure and FD, necessary for FDs statistical analysis. This study investigates the effect of evolutions and interactions of ICMEs on FDs profiles in the inner Solar System, using multipoint comparisons. We focus on multipoint ICME observations by Solar Orbiter, BepiColombo, and near-Earth spacecraft from March 10-16, 2022, when these spacecraft were ideally located for studying the radial and longitudinal evolutions of ICME and accompanying FDs. We compared GCR variations with the multiple in-situ data and ICME model, clarifying the correspondence between the evolution of each ICME structure in radial and azimuthal directions and the depth and gradients of the FD. The radial comparison revealed decreases in FD intensities and gradients associated with the expansion of the ICME. The longitudinal difference found in FD intensity indicates longitudinal variations of the ICMEs shielding effect. These results suggest that accurate multi-point FD comparisons require determining the relationship between the observers position and the inner structure of the passing ICMEs.",

As recently argued, in general both effects are present simultaneously, and accurately modeling them is essential for robust tests of GR in the ringdown regime. In this work, we investigate the impact of extra field-induced modes, which are often neglected in standard ringdown analyses, on the interpretation of gravitational-wave signals. To provide some concrete examples, we focus on dynamical Chern-Simons and Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories, well-motivated extensions of GR, characterized respectively by a parity-odd and a parity-even coupling between a dynamical scalar field and quadratic curvature invariants. We show that including extra field-induced modes improves the bounds on these theories compared to standard spectroscopy and also allows for equally constraining complementary tests not based on quasinormal mode shifts. Our analysis highlights the relevance of incorporating extra field-induced modes in ringdown templates and assesses their potential to either bias or enhance constraints on GR deviations.",

        "abstract": "The strong lensing gravitational waves (GWs) due to intervening massive astrophysical systems between the source and an observer are an inevitable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which can produce multiple GW events in overlapping sky localization error. However, the confirmed detection of such a unique astrophysical phenomenon is challenging due to several sources of contamination, arising from detector noise to astrophysical uncertainties. Robust model-independent search techniques that can mitigate noise contamination were developed in the past. In this study, we explore the astrophysical uncertainty associated with incorrectly classifying a pair of unlensed GW events as a lensed event, and the associated False Alarm Rate (FAR) depending on the GW source properties. To understand the effect of unlensed astrophysical GW sources in producing false lensing detections, we have performed a model-independent test using the pipeline GLANCE on a simulated population of merging binary-black holes (BBHs). We find that $\\sim$ 0.01\\% of the event pairs can be falsely classified as lensed with a lensing threshold signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, appearing at a time delay between the event pairs of $\\sim$ 1000 days or more. We show the FAR distribution for the parameter space of GW source masses, delay time, and lensing magnification parameter over which the model-independent technique GLANCE can confidently detect lensed GW pair with the current LIGO detector sensitivity. In the future, this technique will be useful for understanding the FAR of the upcoming next-generation GW detectors, which can observe many more GW sources.",

The very fast CMEs yield a high correlation of 0.81 between Vcme and the slope of n(h) in a height range above the onset height of the torus instability if one extremely fast outlier, which closely followed another very fast CME, is excluded. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the torus instability plays a decisive role in CME acceleration. The whole sample yields a weaker correlation, which is still significant if events with a broad torus-stable dip in n(h) are excluded. A parametric simulation study of flux-rope eruptions from quadrupolar and two-scale bipolar source regions confirms the decelerating effect of such dips.

        "abstract": "The Cannon-Ball model of Gamma-Ray Bursts and their afterglows--described in the text and in innumerable previous occasions--is extremely successful and predictive. In a few intrinsically bright GRBs, gamma-rays with energies in the TeV range have been observed. The CB model, I argue, has no difficulty in describing the origin and approximate properties of these high-energy gamma rays and the extreme difficulty of observing their accompanying neutrinos.",

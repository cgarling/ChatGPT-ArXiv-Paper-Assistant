        "title": "Fuzzy dark matter dynamical friction: Defying galactic cannibalism of globular clusters",
        "abstract": "We present a new implementation of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) dynamical friction within the galpy framework, enabling orbital integrations of globular clusters (GCs) across a broad range of halo-to-GC mass ratios and boson masses. In this alternative DM scenario, dynamical friction is reduced or even suppressed by heating induced by FDM density granules. We further quantify the role of baryons and solitonic cores, natural consequences of FDM in galaxies, on the efficiency of orbital decay and the long-term survival of GCs. The most significant deviations from the cold DM (CDM) paradigm arise in the dwarf-galaxy regime, where FDM dynamical friction can stall the inspiral of GCs over a Hubble time, thereby preventing their sinking into galactic centers and halting the canonical galactic cannibalism of clusters. Importantly, our FDM-only friction model should be regarded as a conservative lower bound, since the inclusion of realistic FDM cores can only strengthen the survival of GCs through core stalling. This stalling mechanism not only preserves in-situ populations that would otherwise be erased in CDM, but also strongly suppresses the mixing of in-situ and ex-situ clusters, yielding a bimodal radial distribution of GCs. Our results show that the demographics of GC systems encode a distinct dynamical signature of FDM in dwarfs. These predictions open a new pathway to constrain the boson mass parameter with upcoming Euclid DR1 observations of extragalactic GCs, while simultaneously offering a natural explanation for the long-standing Fornax timing problem.",

        "abstract": "The shape and orientation of the Milky Way's dark matter halo remain poorly constrained. Observations of the accreted stellar halo show that it is triaxial and tilted with respect to the disc. If this configuration is long-lived, it can be used to place constraints on the shape and orientation of the dark matter halo that can support it close to steady state. We fit equilibrium orbit-superposition (Schwarzschild) models to the stellar halo in a realistic Milky Way potential with a tilted dark matter halo, assuming that the long axes of each halo and the disc normal are coplanar. These models are matched to parametric density fits and velocity anisotropy measurements of Gaia Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) stars at radii $r\\in[6,60]$ kpc. The observations are consistent with a (near-)prolate dark matter halo whose density has a short-to-long axis ratio of $q_\\mathrm{dm}=0.87_{-0.09}^{+0.05}$. The long axis is inclined at an angle of $\\beta_\\mathrm{dm}=43_{-8}^{+22}\\,^\\circ$ to the disc plane, which exceeds the stellar halo tilt by $\\approx18^\\circ$. Spherical haloes cannot support the observed structure of the GSE in equilibrium. The best-fitting dynamical GSE model has a radius-dependent shape and orientation; between radii of 6 and 60 kpc the tilt increases from $\\beta_*(r)\\approx10^\\circ$ to $\\approx35^\\circ$. Our model provides a good fit to the observed triaxial structure and dynamics of the GSE.

We investigate whether annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can alter primordial (Pop III.1) protostellar evolution sufficiently to enable formation of such `heavy'' seeds.

For our fiducial case, WIMP masses $<$3 TeV are essential for allowing growth to the supermassive regime, otherwise the protostar evolves to the compact, feedback-limited regime that results in `light'' seeds.

        "abstract": "We present a sub-grid model for star formation in galaxy simulations, incorporating molecular hydrogen ($\\mathrm{H}_2$) production via dust grain condensation and its destruction through star formation and photodissociation. Implemented within the magnetohydrodynamical code AREPO, our model tracks the non-equilibrium mass fractions of molecular, ionised, and atomic hydrogen, as well as a stellar component, by solving a system of differential equations governing mass exchange between these phases. Star formation is treated with a variable rate dependent on the local $\\mathrm{H}_2$ abundance, which itself varies in a complex way with key quantities such as gas density and metallicity. Testing the model in a cosmological simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy, we obtain a well-defined spiral structure at $z = 0$, including a gas disc twice the size of the stellar one, alongside a realistic star formation history. Our results show a broad range of star formation efficiencies per free-fall time, from as low as $0.001\\%$ at high redshift to values between $0.1\\%$ and $10\\%$ for ages $\\gtrsim 3-4 \\, \\mathrm{Gyr}$. These findings align well with observational estimates and simulations of a turbulent interstellar medium. Notably, our model reproduces a star formation rate versus molecular hydrogen surface densities relation akin to the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt law. Furthermore, we find that the star formation efficiency varies with density and metallicity, providing an alternative to fixed-efficiency assumptions and enabling comparisons with more detailed star formation models. Comparing different star formation prescriptions, we find that in models that link star formation to $\\mathrm{H}_2$, star formation onset is $\\sim \\! 500 \\, \\mathrm{Myr}$ later than those relying solely on total or cold gas density.",

        "abstract": "Exoplanetary science heavily relies on transit depth ($D$) measurements. Yet, as instrumental precision increases, the uncertainty on $D$ appears to increasingly drift from expectations driven solely by photon-noise. Here we characterize this shortfall (the Transit-Depth Precision Problem, TDPP), by defining an amplification factor, $A$, quantifying the discrepancy between the measured transit-depth uncertainty and the measured baseline scatter on a same time bin size. While in theory $A$ should be $\\sim\\sqrt{3}$, we find that it can reach values $\\gtrsim$10 notably due to correlations between $D$ and the limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs). This means that (1) the performance of transit-based exoplanet studies (e.g., atmospheric studies) can be substantially improved with reliable priors on LDCs and (2) low-fidelity priors on the LDCs can yield substantial biases on $D$--potentially affecting atmospheric studies due to the wavelength-dependence of such biases. For the same reason, biases may emerge on stellar-density and planet-shape/limb-asymmetry measurements. With current photometric precisions, we recommend using a 3$^{\\rm rd}$-order polynomial law and a 4$^{\\rm th}$-order non-linear law, as they provide an optimal compromise between bias and $A$, while testing the fidelity for each parametrization. While their use combined with existing LDC priors (10-20% uncertainty) currently implies $A\\sim10$, we show that targeted improvements to limb-darkening models can bring $A$ down to $\\sim2$. Improving stellar models and transit-fitting practices is thus essential to fully exploit transit datasets, and reliably increasing their scientific yield by $5\\times$, thereby enabling the same science with up to $25\\times$ fewer transits.",

The sensitivity and wavelength coverage of the NIRCam instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope offer a unique method for finding low-temperature brown dwarfs in deep extragalactic datasets out to multiple kiloparsecs. Here we report on the selection of a sample of 41 brown dwarf and brown dwarf candidates across the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N regions. We introduce a new open-source Bayesian tool, the Near-Infrared Fitting for T and Y-dwarfs (\\texttt{NIFTY}), to derive effective temperatures, metallicities, and distances from JWST photometry. We find that 31 candidates have fits consistent with T-dwarf temperatures out to 5 - 6 kpc, and 10 candidates have fits consistent with Y-dwarf temperatures out to 1 - 2 kpc. The majority of the sources are best fit with sub-solar metallicity models, consistent with them being subdwarfs in the Milky Way thick disk and halo. We report proper motions for nine brown dwarf candidates (three are newly presented), and calculate the number density of T- and Y-dwarfs as a function of temperature and distance above the Milky Way midplane. We further discuss how Y-dwarfs can serve as contaminants in the search for ultra-high-redshift galaxies. Together, these results demonstrate the power of deep JWST extragalactic imaging to probe the coldest substellar populations far beyond the solar neighborhood, providing new constraints on the Milky Way's structure and brown dwarf demographics.",

Based on high-resolution spectral observations of 44 open star clusters in the Gaia-ESO survey, our aim is to perform the first large-scale homogeneous investigation into the carbon and nitrogen photospheric content of low- and intermediate-mass giant stars in different phases of evolution. Methods. We determined carbon and nitrogen abundances using spectral synthesis of the C2 Swan (1,0) band head at 5135 {\\AA} and C2 Swan (0,1) band head at 5635.5 {\\AA}, 12C14N bands in the interval 6470 - 6490 {\\AA}, and the forbidden [O i] line at 6300.31 {\\AA}. Results. We revealed differences in C/N abundance ratios between pre- and post-core-He-flash stars. The lower C/N ratios in core He-burning red clump stars are mainly due to the enhancement of nitrogen abundances. We presented calibrations of the relationship between [C/N] and stellar age for solar metallicity low- and intermediate-mass giants taking into account different evolutionary stages. Conclusions. The C/N abundance ratios in the investigated first-ascent giant stars are slightly less affected by the first dredge-up than predicted by the theoretical models. The rotation-induced extra mixing is not as efficient as theoretically predicted. The core helium flash may trigger additional alterations in carbon and nitrogen abundances that are not yet theoretically modelled.

The total exposure time of 250 ks provides unprecedented sensitivity to study the diffuse hot gas in the halo, significantly surpassing the depth of previous observations. Aims. While the presence of hot, circumgalactic gas is well tested for starburst galaxies, detections in normal galaxies remain scarce. By studying the diffuse X-ray emission in NGC 5746, we aim to provide new insights into the evolution of star-forming galaxies and their surroundings. Methods. We create X-ray images and surface brightness profiles to quantify the distribution of extraplanar gas in the halo of NGC 5746. In addition, we isolate the diffuse emission component from point source- and background-contamination and study the spectral characteristics of the hot plasma. Results. We detect soft X-ray emission out to 40 kpc from the galactic disc. The gas distribution is reminiscent of a stellar outflow, with two bubbles extending perpendicular to the disc in a biconical shape. The spectral analysis of the halo emission yields a plasma temperature of 0.56 keV, higher than the typical values observed in spiral galaxies (0.2 keV). The disc has an even higher plasma temperature of 0.7 keV, and is dominated by non-thermal emission from unresolved X-ray binaries. The signs of a stellar outflow, bright X-ray emission, and high plasma temperatures indicate that the star-forming activity in NGC 5746 might be higher than previously thought. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate that massive spiral galaxies can host luminous X-ray halos, and support theoretical models that predict their existence. Earlier claims of a lack of hot gas around quiescent spirals might be attributed to the detection thresholds in shallower observations, stressing the need for more, deeper observations of non-starburst galaxies.",

Their physical properties are typically derived through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but the reliability of this approach for such early systems remains uncertain. Applying {\\sc Bagpipes} on simulated SEDs at $z=6$ from the {\\sc Sphinx$^{20}$} cosmological simulation, we examine uncertainties in the recovery of stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR$_{10}$), and stellar metallicities from mock JWST/Near-Infrared Camera photometry. Even without dust or emission lines, fitting the intrinsic stellar continuum overestimates the stellar mass by about 60\\% on average (and by up to a factor of five for low-mass galaxies with recent starbursts) and underestimates SFR$_{10}$ by a factor of two, owing to inaccurate star formation histories and age-metallicity degeneracies. The addition of dust and nebular emission further amplifies these biases, yielding offsets of approximately +0.3 and -0.4 dex in stellar mass and SFR$_{10}$, respectively, while leaving stellar metallicities largely unconstrained. Incorporating bands free of strong emission lines, such as F410M, helps mitigate stellar mass overestimation by disentangling line emission from older stellar populations. We also find that best-fit or likelihood-weighted estimates are generally more accurate than median posterior values. Although stellar mass functions are reproduced reasonably well, the slope of the star formation main sequence depends sensitively on the adopted fitting model. Overall, these results underscore the importance of careful modelling when interpreting high-$z$ photometry, particularly for galaxies with recent star formation burst and/or strong emission lines, to minimise systematic biases in derived physical properties.",

        "abstract": "With the launch and application of next-generation ground- and space-based telescopes, astronomy has entered the era of big data, necessitating more efficient and robust data analysis methods. Most traditional parameter estimation methods are unable to reconcile differences between photometric systems. Ideally, we would like to optimally rely on high-quality observation data provided by, e.g., JWST, for calibrating and improving upcoming wide-field surveys such as the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) and Euclid. To this end, we introduce a new approach (SHAPE, SOM-SED Hybrid Approach for efficient Parameter Estimation) that can bridge different photometric systems and efficiently estimate key galaxy parameters, such as stellar mass ($M_\\star$) and star formation rate (SFR), leveraging data from a large and deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI survey (PRIMER). As a test of the methodology, we focus on galaxies at $z\\sim 1.5-2.5$. To mitigate discrepancies between input colors and the training set, we replace the default SOM weights with stacked SEDs from each cell, extending the applicability of our model to other photometric catalogs (e.g., COSMOS2020). By incorporating a SED library (SED Lib), we apply this JWST-calibrated model to the COSMOS2020 catalog. Despite the limited sample size and potential template-related uncertainties, SOM-derived parameters exhibit a good agreement with results from SED-fitting using extended photometry. Under identical photometric constraints from CSST and Euclid bands, our method outperforms traditional SED-fitting techniques in SFR estimation, exhibiting both a reduced bias (-0.01 vs. 0.18) and a smaller $\\sigma_{\\rm NMAD}$ (0.25 vs. 0.35). With its computational efficiency capable of processing $10^6$ sources per CPU per hour during the estimation phase, this JWST-calibrated estimator holds significant promise for next-generation wide-field surveys.",

We utilize the Balmer decrement to measure dust-corrected H$\\alpha$-based SFRs, taking into account the subsolar metallicities observed in galaxies at high redshift. We confirm, with our large sample size, that the correlation between the Balmer decrement and stellar mass is already established out to $z\\sim7$. We find that the relation between the Balmer decrement and stellar mass does not significantly evolve from the local universe to $z\\sim7$. We investigate the UV slope as a function of the Balmer optical depth and find that the best-fit correlation for our high redshift sample is sSFR dependent and significantly different at high redshift when compared to galaxies at $z\\approx 0$ and $z \\approx 2$. For the highest sSFR galaxies in our sample, there is no significant correlation between the UV slope and Balmer optical depth.

        "abstract": "The observation of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the intergalactic medium will probe the epoch of reionization (EoR) with unprecedented detail. Various simulations are being developed and used to predict and understand the nature and morphology of this signal. However, these simulations are computationally very expensive and time-consuming to produce in large numbers. To overcome this problem, an efficient field-level emulator of this signal is required. However, the EoR 21-cm signal is highly non-Gaussian; therefore, capturing the correlations between different scales of this signal, which is directly related to the evolution of the reionization, with the neural network is quite difficult. Here, we introduce CosmoUiT, a UNet integrated vision transformer-based architecture, to overcome these difficulties. CosmoUiT emulates the 3D cubes of 21-cm signal from the EoR, for a given input dark matter density field, halo density field, and reionization parameters. CosmoUiT uses the multi-head self-attention mechanism of the transformer to capture the long-range dependencies and convolutional layers in the UNet to capture the small-scale variations in the target 21-cm field. Furthermore, the training of the emulator is conditioned on the input reionization parameters such that it gives a fast and accurate prediction of the 21-cm field for different sets of input reionization parameters. We evaluate the predictions of our emulator by comparing various statistics (e.g., bubble size distribution, power spectrum) and morphological features of the emulated and simulated maps. We further demonstrate that this vision transformer-based architecture can emulate the entire 3D 21-cm signal cube with high accuracy at both large and small scales.",

Their role as dust producers in the high-redshift Universe may be of paramount importance. However, the type and amount of dust they synthesise after outburst is still a matter of debate and the formation processes remain unclear.   Aims. We aim to identify and understand the chemical processes at play in the dust formation scenario, and derive mass yields for molecules and dust clusters at late post-explosion time. Methods. We revisit existing models by improving on the physics and chemistry of the supernova ejecta. We identify and consider new chemical species and pathways underpinning the formation of dust clusters, and apply a unique exhaustive chemical network to the entire ejecta of a Supernova with a 15 Msun progenitor. We test this new chemistry for various gas conditions in the ejecta, and derive mass yields for molecules and dust clusters.   Results. We obtain the molecular component of the ejecta up to 11 years after explosion. The most abundant species are, in order of decreasing masses, O2, CO, SiS, SiO, CO2, SO2, CaS, N2, and CS. We identify molecules that are tracers of high-density clumps. As for dust clusters, we find the composition is dominated by silicates and silica, along with carbon dust, but with modest amounts of alumina. Pure metal clusters and metal sulphide and oxide clusters have negligible masses. High-density gas favours the formation of carbon clusters in the outer ejecta region whereas low temperatures hamper the formation of silicates in the oxygen core. The results are in good agreement with existing astronomical data and recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. They highlight the importance of chemistry for the derivation of dust budget from Supernovae.",

        "abstract": "The population of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) may represent a key phase of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at $z=5.5$. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense ($n_{\\rm H}=10^{9-10}$ cm$^{-3}$) warm layer with electron temperature $T_{\\rm e}\\approx7000$ K. The broad wings of H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high $\\rm H\\alpha:H\\beta:H\\gamma$ flux ratio of $\\approx10.4:1:0.14$ is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow H$\\gamma$ component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate $\\sim5$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the $\\lambda>1500$ {\\AA} continuum and a low mass ($\\sim10^8$ M$_{\\odot}$) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum. Our findings indicate that Balmer lines are not directly tracing gas kinematics near the SMBH and that the BH mass scale is likely much lower than virial indicators suggest.",

        "abstract": "If dark matter is ultra-light and has certain Standard Model interactions, it can change the mass-radius relation of white dwarf stars. The coherence length of ultra-light dark matter imparts spatial correlations in deviations from the canonical mass-radius relation, and thus white dwarfs can be used to reconstruct the coherence length, or equivalently the particle mass, of the dark matter field. We simulate the observability of such spatial correlations accounting for realistic complications like variable hydrogen envelope thickness, dust, binaries, measurement noise, and distance uncertainties in DA white dwarfs. Using a machine learning approach on simulated data, we measure the dark matter field coherence length and find that large deviations from the mass-radius relation ($\\sim10\\%$ change in radius) are needed to produce an observable signal given realistic noise sources. We apply our spatial correlation measurement routine to the SDSS catalog of 10,207 DA white dwarfs. We detect a positive spatial correlation among white dwarfs at separations corresponding to a coherence length of $300\\pm50$ pc, with an average Z-score of 85 for white dwarfs separated by less than this coherence length. We conclude that this signal is due to observational bias. The signal can be explained by an offset between measurements and theory for nearby cool white dwarfs, and the presence of few, low-temperature white dwarfs with noisy measurements at further distances. With future improvements in white dwarf models and measurement techniques, particularly for cool white dwarfs, this method can provide interesting constraints on ultra-light dark matter models.",

        "abstract": "The atomic hydrogen HI content of galaxies is intimately related to star formation and galaxy evolution through the baryon cycle, which involves processes such as accretion, feedback, outflows, and gas recycling. While probing the HI gas over cosmic time has improved our understanding, direct HI detection is essentially limited to $z \\lesssim 0.42$ due to the faintness of the 21cm line. Detections beyond this redshift have made use of the stacking technique to obtain average quantities of galaxy populations. Gravitational lensing by the cluster lenses enhances the HI signal and can extend the redshift limit further. In this work, we describe simulations of HI lensing in cluster lenses. We explore the feasibility of detecting strongly lensed HI emission from background galaxies using known 50 cluster lenses within the uGMRT sky coverage. We demonstrate that certain clusters offer a strong likelihood of HI detection. We also investigate how strong lensing distorts the HI spectral line profile. The shape of the HI signal in these lensing models provides useful information and can be used in optimising signal extraction in blind and targeted HI surveys. We find that blind detection of HI signal from galaxies in the redshift range up to 1.58 requires more than a few hundred hours of observations of individual clusters with the uGMRT. Detection of HI emission in galaxies where strong lensing has been observed in the optical appears to be more promising with potential for a $5\\sigma$ detection in $<50$ hours of on-source observations for Abell 370 and in $<75$ hours for Abell 1703 with the uGMRT.",

        "abstract": "More than 60 years have passed since the first formal suggestion to use strongly-lensed supernovae to measure the expansion rate of the Universe through time-delay cosmography. Yet, fewer than 10 such objects have ever been discovered. We consider the merits of a targeted strategy focused on lensed hyperluminous infrared galaxies -- among the most rapidly star-forming galaxies known in the Universe. With star formation rates (SFRs) $\\sim {200 - 6000}~\\textrm{M}_\\odot~\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$, the $\\sim 30$ objects in the Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts (PASSAGES) are excellent candidates for a case study, in particular, and have already led to the discovery of the multiply-imaged SN H0pe. Considering their lens model-corrected SFRs, we estimate their intrinsic supernova rates to be an extraordinary ${1.8 - 65}~\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ (core-collapse) and ${0.2 - 6.4}~\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ (Type Ia). Moreover, these massive starbursts typically have star-forming companions which are unaccounted for in this tally. We demonstrate a strong correlation between Einstein radius and typical time delays, with cluster lenses often exceeding several months (and therefore most favorable for high-precision $H_0$ inferences). A multi-visit monitoring campaign with a sensitive infrared telescope (namely, JWST) is necessary to mitigate dust attenuation. Still, a porous interstellar medium and clumpy star formation in these extreme galaxies might produce favorable conditions for detecting supernovae as transient point sources. Targeted campaigns of known lensed galaxies to discover new lensed supernovae can greatly complement wide-area cadenced surveys. Increasing the sample size helps to realize the potential of supernova time-delay cosmography to elucidate the Hubble tension through a single-step measurement, independent of other $H_0$ techniques.",

        "abstract": "Radio synchrotron emission originates from both massive star formation and black hole accretion, two processes that drive galaxy evolution. Efficient classification of sources dominated by either process is therefore essential for fully exploiting deep, wide-field extragalactic radio continuum surveys. In this study, we implement, optimize, and compare five widely used supervised machine-learning (ML) algorithms to classify radio sources detected in the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE)-COSMOS survey as star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Training and test sets are constructed from conventionally classified MIGHTEE-COSMOS sources, and 18 physical parameters of the MIGHTEE-detected sources are evaluated as input features. As anticipated, our feature analyses rank the five parameters used in conventional classification as the most effective: the infrared-radio correlation parameter ($q_\\mathrm{IR}$), the optical compactness morphology parameter (class$\\_$star), stellar mass, and two combined mid-infrared colors. By optimizing the ML models with these selected features and testing classifiers across various feature combinations, we find that model performance generally improves as additional features are incorporated. Overall, all five algorithms yield an $F1$-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) $>90\\%$ even when trained on only $20\\%$ of the dataset. Among them, the distance-based $k$-nearest neighbors classifier demonstrates the highest accuracy and stability, establishing it as a robust and effective method for classifying SFGs and AGN in upcoming large radio continuum surveys.",

        "abstract": "No experimental test precludes the possibility that the dark matter experiences forces beyond general relativity -- in fact, a variety of cosmic microwave background observations suggest greater late-time structure than predicted in the standard $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter model. We show that minimal models of scalar-mediated forces between dark matter particles do not enhance the growth of unbiased tracers of structure: weak lensing observables depend on the total density perturbation, for which the enhanced growth of the density contrast in the matter era is cancelled by the more rapid dilution of the background dark matter density. Moreover, the same background-level effects imply that scenarios compatible with CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies in fact suppress structure growth, as fixing the distance to last scattering requires a substantially increased density of dark energy. Though massive mediators undo these effects upon oscillating, they suppress structure even further because their gravitational impact as nonclustering subcomponents of matter outweighs the enhanced clustering strength of dark matter. We support these findings with analytic insight that clarifies the physical impact of dark forces and explains how primary CMB measurements calibrate the model's predictions for low-redshift observables. We discuss implications for neutrino mass limits and other cosmological anomalies, and we also consider how nonminimal extensions of the model might be engineered to enhance structure.",

We measure the angular auto-correlation of LOFAR sources in redshift bins and their cross-correlation with multi-wavelength sources {to} measure the evolving galaxy bias for SFGs and LERGs. Our work shows the bias of the radio-selected SFGs increases from $b=0.90^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ at $z \\sim 0.2$ to $b = 2.94^{+0.36}_{-0.36}$ at $z \\sim 1.2$; faster than the assumed $b(z)$$\\propto$$1/D(z)$ models adopted in previous LOFAR cosmology studies (at sensitivities where AGN dominate), but in broad agreement with previous work. We further study the luminosity dependence of bias for SFGs and find little evidence for any luminosity dependence at fixed redshift, although uncertainties remain large for the sample sizes available. The LERG population instead shows a weaker redshift evolution with $b=2.33^{+0.28}_{-0.27}$ at $z \\sim 0.7$ to $b=2.65^{+0.57}_{-0.55}$ at $z \\sim 1.2$, though it is also consistent with the assumed bias evolution model ($b(z)$$\\propto$$1/D(z)$) within the measured uncertainties. For those LERGs which reside in quiescent galaxies (QLERGs), there is weak evidence that they are more biased than the general LERG population and evolve from $b = 2.62^{+0.33}_{-0.33}$ at $z \\sim 0.7$ to $b = 3.08^{+0.85}_{-0.84}$ at $z \\sim 1.2$. This suggests the halo environment of radio sources may be related to their properties. These measurements can help constrain models for the bias evolution of these source populations, and can help inform multi-tracer analyses.",

We show that JWST photometry alone can reveal and quantify interstellar ices and present a new open-source modeling tool, icemodels, to produce synthetic photometry of ices based on laboratory measurements. We provide reference tables indicating which filters are likely to be observably affected by ice absorption. Applying these models to NIRCam data of background stars behind Galactic Center (GC) clouds, and validating against NIRSpec spectra of Galactic disk sources, we find clear signatures of CO, H$_2$O, and CO$_2$ ices and evidence for excess absorption in the F356W filter likely caused by CH-bearing species such as methanol. The ice ratios differ between the Galactic disk and Center, with GC clouds showing a higher H$_2$O fraction. The large ice abundance in CO, H2O, and possibly complex molecules hints that the high complex molecule abundances observed in gas emission in the CMZ are driven by ice-phase chemistry in non-star-forming gas. Accounting for all likely ices, we infer that $>25%$ of the total carbon is frozen into CO ice in the GC, which exceeds the entire solar-neighborhood carbon budget. By assuming the freezeout fraction is the same in GC and disk clouds, we obtain a metallicity measurement indicating that $Z_GC\\gtrsim2.5Z_\\odot$. These results demonstrate that photometric ice measurements are feasible with JWST and capable of probing the metallicity structure of the cold interstellar medium.",

When the collimated GRB outflow interacts with the outer layers of a star or the wind generated by a binary neutron star merger, it releases energy, forming a quasi-spherical outflow around it. This broad outflow begins to radiate once it has transferred enough energy to the surrounding medium. We have developed a new analytical model that describes the synchrotron afterglow scenario of the quasi-spherical outflow, including factors such as stratified density, self-absorption regime, and the fraction of electrons accelerated by the shock front.

        "abstract": "Weak gravitational lensing signals of optically identified clusters are impacted by a selection bias -- halo triaxiality and large-scale structure along the line of sight simultaneously boost the lensing signal and richness (the inferred number of galaxies associated with a cluster). As a result, a cluster sample selected by richness has a mean lensing signal higher than expected from its mean mass, and the inferred mass will be biased high. This selection bias is currently limiting the accuracy of cosmological parameters derived from optical clusters. In this paper, we quantify the bias in mass calibration due to this selection bias. Using two simulations, MiniUchuu and Cardinal, with different galaxy models and cluster finders, we find that the selection bias leads to an overestimation of lensing mass at a 20-50% level, with a larger bias 20-80% for large-scale lensing (>3 Mpc). Even with a conservative projection model, the impact of selection bias significantly outweighs the impact of other currently known cluster lensing systematics. We urge the cluster community to account for this bias in all future optical cluster cosmology analyses, and we discuss strategies for mitigating this bias.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the foreground interstellar medium along the line of sight and intracluster medium of $\\omega$ Centauri ($\\omega$ Cen) by measuring the equivalent width of Na I D absorptions from MUSE observations. The large line-of-sight velocity difference between $\\omega$ Cen and the foreground enables us to separate Na I D absorption contributed from atomic gas in the interstellar and intracluster medium. We find that small-scale substructures in the foreground Na I D distribution correlate with differential reddening derived from photometric methods. Using an empirical Na I D equivalent width-reddening relation, we determine an average reddening of $E(B-V)=0.153\\pm0.003$ mag within the half-light radius of $\\omega$ Cen. However, the Na I D-inferred differential reddening is significantly larger than photometric estimates. This is likely due to scatter in the Na I D-reddening relation. We find no evidence for intracluster atomic gas from spectra of horizontal branch stars, as there is no significant Na I D absorption at $\\omega$ Cen's systemic velocity. Given this non-detection, we place the strongest upper limit to date on the intracluster atomic gas column density in $\\omega$ Cen of $\\lesssim2.17 \\times 10^{18}~\\rm{cm^{-2}}$. We also estimate the ionized gas density from pulsar dispersion measure variations, which exceed the atomic gas limit by $\\sim$50 times. Nevertheless, the strong correlation between dispersion measure and foreground Na I D suggests that much or all of this ionized gas resides in the foreground. Given ongoing mass loss from bright giant stars, our findings imply that the intracluster gas accumulation timescale is short, and gas removal in the cluster is likely not tied to stripping as $\\omega$ Cen passes through the Galactic disk.",

This study investigates the potential impacts of PBH Hawking radiation on the intergalactic medium from $z\\sim 800-25$, namely studying the ionization history, kinetic gas temperature, and ultimately the 21 cm signature. We find that for masses on the low edge of the asteroid mass window, there are up two orders of magnitude increases in the ionization fraction and kinetic gas temperature by redshift 25, and the 21 cm spin temperature can differ from non-PBH cosmology by factors of a few. This analysis results in maximum differential brightness temperatures of +17 mK for our lightest PBH masses of $2.12\\times 10^{16}$g. We also show maximal $53$ mK discrepancies in differential brightness temperatures between our PBH and non-PBH cosmologies for our lightest PBH mass, while our heaviest PBH mass of $1.65 \\times 10^{17}$g shows only $0.5$ mK variations.

In this paper, we present multi-band photometric and spectroscopic observations spanning $\\sim$100 days post-discovery. Its multi-band light curves display three distinct peaks: (1) an initial peak at $t \\approx 1.6$ days attributed to shock cooling emission, (2) a secondary peak of $M_{R, \\, peak} \\approx$ $-$15.8 mag at $t \\approx 10.2$ days powered by radioactive decay, and (3) a late-time bump at $t \\approx 42.8$ days likely caused by ejecta-circumstellar material/clump interaction. Spectral evolution of SN 2025coe reveals a fast transition to the nebular phase within 2 months, where it exhibits an exceptionally high [Ca II]/[O I] ratio larger than 6. Modeling of the bolometric light curve suggests an ejecta mass of $M_{\\rm ej} = 0.29^{+0.14}_{-0.15} \\, M_{\\odot}$, a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M_{\\rm ^{56}Ni} = 2.4^{+0.06}_{-0.05} \\times 10^{-2} M_{\\odot}$, and a progenitor envelope with mass $M_e = 1.4^{+6.9}_{-1.2} \\times 10^{-3} \\, M_{\\odot}$ and radius $R_e = 13.5^{+64.1}_{-11.1} \\, R_{\\odot}$.

        "abstract": "In the framework of entropic cosmology, entropic forces arising at the cosmological horizon have been proposed as an alternative mechanism to explain the Universe's current accelerated phase. However, recent studies have shown that, under the Clausius relation and assuming a linear mass-to-horizon (MHR) relation, all entropic force models reduce to the original Bekenstein-Hawking formulation, regardless of the specific form of the horizon entropy. As a result, they inherit the same observational limitations in accounting for cosmic dynamics. To address this issue, a generalized MHR has been introduced, providing the foundation for a modified cosmological scenario rooted in the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture. In this work, we explore the implications of this generalized framework for early-Universe dynamics. Specifically, we analyze the growth of matter perturbations within the spherical Top-Hat formalism in the linear regime, showing that the density contrast profile is significantly influenced by the modified background dynamics predicted by the model. Moreover, considering the sensitivity of upcoming gravitational wave detectors in the sub-$10^3\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ range, we examine the impact on the relic abundance of Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs), identifying parameter regions where deviations from standard cosmology may arise through an enhanced PGW spectrum.",

        "abstract": "Molecules are ubiquitous in space. They are necessary component in the creation of habitable planetary systems and can provide the basic building blocks of life. Solid-state processes are pivotal in the formation of molecules in space and surface diffusion in particular is a key driver of chemistry in extraterrestrial environments, such as the massive clouds in which stars and planets are formed and the icy objects within our Solar System. However, for many atoms and molecules quantitative theoretical and experimental information on diffusion, such as activation barriers, are lacking. This hinders us in unraveling chemical processes in space and determining how the chemical ingredients of planets and life are formed. In this article, an astrochemical perspective on diffusion is provided. Described are the relevant adsorbate-surface systems, the methods to model their chemical processes, and the computational and laboratory techniques to determine diffusion parameters, including the latest developments in the field. While much progress has been made, many astrochemically relevant systems remain unexplored. The complexity of ice surfaces, their temperature-dependent restructuring, and effects at low temperatures create unique challenges that demand innovative experimental approaches and theoretical frameworks. This intersection of astrochemistry and surface science offers fertile ground for physical chemists to apply their expertise. We invite the physical chemistry community to explore these systems, where precise diffusion parameters would dramatically advance our understanding of molecular evolution in space - from interstellar clouds to planetary surfaces - with implications on our understanding on the origins of life and planetary habitability.",

A striking signature is that any infalling object appears to orbit at $\\Omega_H$ due to frame dragging, while its emitted signals decay exponentially at a rate set by $\\kappa$ as a consequence of gravitational redshift.

The data reveal broad Balmer emission from H$\\alpha$-H$\\delta$ and Balmer absorption in H$\\alpha$-H$\\epsilon$. The absorption lines are kinematically split: H$\\alpha$ is blueshifted while higher-order lines are redshifted suggesting complex gas kinematics; their relative ratios are inconsistent with a single, passive absorbing screen. The line depths require absorption of both the BLR and the continuum, ruling out a stellar origin, consistent with the smooth Balmer break. We fit the broad H$\\gamma$-H$\\alpha$ lines and find the data favor a double-Gaussian effective profile, although exponential wings are evident. Depending on the adopted profile, single-epoch virial estimates give log(M$_\\bullet$/M$_\\odot$)=7.86-8.39 and $\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}$=1.7-0.4. The dynamical mass implied by the narrow lines is low log(Mdyn/M$_\\odot$)=9.1, suggesting an overmassive black hole. The narrow lines display little attenuation, A$_V<0.5$ mag; while broad H$\\alpha$/H$\\beta\\sim9$ and the broad Balmer decrements are inconsistent with standard dust attenuation curves, suggesting collisional processes. The forbidden-line spectrum includes auroral [S II] and [N II], and a forest of [Fe II] lines. Line ratios and kinematics indicate a stratified narrow-line region with both low (n$_{\\rm e}$=420 cm$^{-3}$) and high densities (n$_{\\rm e}\\gtrsim 6.3\\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$). We detect metal absorption lines in both the optical (Ca II and Na I) and UV range (Fe II UV1-UV3). Our results support a picture of a compact AGN embedded in a dense, high covering-factor and stratified cocoon, with complex neutral-gas kinematics. While the choice of broad-line profile affects the virial estimates of M$_\\bullet$, we find the effect to be of order 0.6 dex between the different approaches.",

Although the tearing-mode instability is commonly thought to trigger a plasmoid cascade that enables fast reconnection - i.e., independent of $S$ - our results, in broad agreement with the recent findings of Morillo \\& Alexakis (2025), challenge this belief. We demonstrate a Sweet-Parker scaling of the reconnection rate $V_{\\text{rec}} \\sim S^{-1/2}$ up to Lundquist numbers $S \\sim 10^4$. For larger values, plasmoid formation sets in leading to a slight enhancement of the reconnection rate, $V_{\\text{rec}} \\sim S^{-1/3}$, consistent with the prediction from linear tearing mode induced reconnection, indicating that reconnection remains resistivity dependent, and therefore slow. In our simulations, the plasmoids do not form a cascade of mergers, as they are rapidly advected out of the reconnection layer. Our findings call for the revision of the role of plasmoid formation in 2D high Lundquist number magnetic reconnection. Even if future studies demonstrate that 2D plasmoid-reconnection becomes resistivity-independent at sufficiently large $S$, directly extending those results to 3D astrophysical environments is not justified, as in realistic circumstances, the increase of $S$ also raises the Reynolds number of the outflows, making it essential to account for the dominant role of turbulence.",

The radii of each star were measured with an accuracy of about 1 \\%. By periodogram analysis of the outside-eclipse residual lights obtained from the binary star model, we extracted nine significant signals, five of which are likely aliasing frequencies due to sampling artifacts and uncorrected trends in the data used. The other signals of $f_1$, $f_2$, $f_3$, and $f_6$ are considered to be independent pulsations with frequencies ranging from 0.73 day$^{-1}$ to 1.02 day$^{-1}$, corresponding to pulsation constants of 0.63$-$0.88 days.

TIGERISS will make the first definitive measurements of Ultra-Heavy Galactic Cosmic Rays (UHGCRs; Z >29) on an individual element basis past barium ($^{56}$Ba), through the lanthinides, and to lead ($^{82}$Pb). TIGERISS has a geometry factor of 1.06 m$^2$ sr and is comprised of four planes of single-sided silicon strip detectors (SSDs) arranged in orthogonal X-Y layers with an X-Y pair above and an X-Y pair below two large-area Cherenkov detectors. The top Cherenkov detector is comprised of a mosaic of aerogel radiators (n =1.05) while the bottom Cherenkov detector has an acrylic radiator (n = 1.49). The combination of the Cherenkov velocity measurements with the precise measurements of the ionization and trajectory of the traversing cosmic rays leads to highly accurate charge measurements of $<$ 0.25 c.u. over the entire elemental range of $^5$B through $^{82}$Pb. These TIGERISS measurements are highly sensitive in determining the strength of s-process, r-process, and rp-processes of Galactic nucleosynthesis while providing critical data needed for multi-messenger studies to determine the contributions of extreme phenomena, including supernovae (SN) and Neutron Star Mergers (NSMs), in the production of galactic matter.

Previous work indicated that unless chiral chemical potential is as large as the electron vector chemical potential, the growth of magnetic fields due to the instability is washed out by chirality flipping rate enabled by electron mass. We re-examine this claim in a broader range of parameters and find that at higher temperatures the hierarchy is reversed supporting a growing magnetic field for an initial electron chiral chemical potential much smaller than the electron vector chemical potential. Further, we identify a qualitatively new effect relevant for magnetized hot and dense medium where chiral magnetic effect (CME) sourced by density fluctuation acts as a powerful source of Joule heating. Remarkably, even modest chiral chemical potentials (keV) in such environment can deposit energy densities set by the QCD scale in a relatively short time of the order of a few milliseconds or seconds. We speculate how this mechanism makes CME-driven Joule heating a potentially critical ingredient in the dynamics of turbulent density fluctuation of supernovae and neutron star mergers.",

We explore how complementary astronomical observations can break these degeneracies and, in this context, we investigate whether early DSNB observations can constrain invisible supernovae, which have no optical emission but are powerful neutrino sources before being swallowed by a forming black hole. Leveraging the differences in the spectra between invisible and visible supernovae, we estimate the sensitivity of 1) detecting the existence of invisible supernovae, and 2) determining the fraction of invisible supernovae.

Historically, any new discovery about the proton has fuelled advances in several scientific fields. We have reported that gluons inside the proton accumulate near the critical momentum due to chaotic phenomena, forming gluon condensation. Surprisingly, the pion distribution predicted by this gluon distribution for the production of high-energy proton collisions could answer two puzzles in astronomy and high-energy physics. We find that during ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray collisions, gluon condensation may abruptly produce a large number of low-momentum pions, whose electromagnetic decays have the typical breakout properties appearing in various cosmic gamma-ray spectra. On the other hand, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is well below the cosmic ray energy scale, also shows weak but recognisable signs of gluon condensation, which had been mistaken for BEC pions. The connection between these two phenomena, which occur at different scales in the Universe, supports the existence of a new structure within the proton-gluon condensation.",

        "abstract": "The Hadrosymmetric Twin Higgs (HTH) model provides a natural solution to the little hierarchy problem by incorporating all three generations of quarks in a twin sector. Unlike other Twin Higgs scenarios, such as the Mirror Twin Higgs (MTH), the HTH framework avoids introducing additional light states or radiation and thus remains consistent with stringent bounds on the effective number of relativistic species, $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$. Its particle content and interactions also make it difficult to probe at colliders, highlighting the importance of cosmological tests. In this work, we study the cosmological implications of the HTH model, focusing on the persistent tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($\\sigma_8$). Implementing the HTH sector in a Boltzmann code and confronting it with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and local $H_0$ measurements, we find that the scenario reduces the Hubble tension from more than $4\\sigma$ to about $2.5\\sigma$, while also alleviating the $\\sigma_8$ discrepancy. These results demonstrate that the HTH framework not only addresses naturalness in particle physics but also offers a viable route to mitigating current cosmological tensions, thereby strengthening the link between fundamental theory and precision cosmology.",

HIP 33609 b is a highly eccentric, 68 $M_{\\rm J}$ brown dwarf orbiting a 10,300 K, A-type star with an orbital period of 39 days. Its host star is a known member of the 150 Myr old MELANGE-6 moving group, making it an excellent laboratory for testing sub-stellar evolutionary models. Using in-transit spectra collected by the Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) on the Magellan II Clay 6.5 m telescope, we measured a sky-projected orbital obliquity of $|\\lambda|= 12.7 \\pm 1.3${\\deg}. The mass of the brown dwarf is most consistent with a stellar-like fragmentation formation history followed by a period of migration. Given the high eccentricity ($e=0.557$) but low orbital obliquity of the brown dwarf, we claim that coplanar high eccentricity tidal migration seems to be the most plausible pathway, however, it remains difficult to conclusively rule out other migration mechanisms. The low orbital obliquity for HIP 33609 is consistent with previous measurements of high mass-ratio companions, and bears a striking resemblance to the obliquity distribution of transiting warm Jupiters. We suggest brown dwarfs may follow a dynamically quiescent migration pathway, consistent with them forming in isolated conditions.",

Only a handful of events have been discovered to date, all through multi-wavelength (gamma ray) and multi-messenger (gravitational wave) signals.

To this end, we present our follow-up observations of the gravitational-wave signal, S250818k, a plausible binary neutron star merger at a distance of $237 \\pm 62$ Mpc. Pan-STARRS tiled 286 and 318 square degrees (32% and 34% of the 90% sky localisation region) within 3 and 7 days of the GW signal, respectively. ATLAS covered 70% of the skymap within 3 days, but with lower sensitivity. These observations uncovered 47 new transients; however, none were deemed to be linked to S250818k. We undertook an expansive follow-up campaign of AT 2025ulz, the purported counterpart to S250818k. The griz-band lightcurve, combined with our redshift measurement ($z = 0.0849 \\pm 0.0003$) all indicate that SN 2025ulz is a SN IIb, and thus not the counterpart to S250818k.

        "abstract": "One of the most puzzling properties of the high-redshift AGN population recently discovered by JWST, including both broad-line and narrow-line sources, is their X-ray weakness. With very few exceptions, and regardless of the optical classification, they are undetected at the limits of the deepest Chandra fields, even when stacking signals from tens of sources in standard observed-frame energy intervals (soft, hard, and full bands). It has been proposed that their elusive nature in the X-ray band is due to heavy absorption by dust-free gas or intrinsic weakness, possibly due to high, super-Eddington accretion. In this work, we perform X-ray stacking in three customized rest-frame energy ranges (1-4, 4-7.25, and 10-30 keV) of a sample of 50 Type 1 and 38 Type 2 AGN identified by JWST in the CDFS and CDFN fields. For the Type 2 sub-sample, we reach a total of about 210 Ms exposure, and we report a significant ($\\sim 3\\sigma$) detection in the hardest (10-30 keV rest frame) band, along with relatively tight upper limits in the rest frame softer energy bands. The most straightforward interpretation is in terms of heavy obscuration due to gas column densities well within the Compton thick regime ($> 2 \\times 10^{24} $cm$^{-2}$) with a large covering factor, approaching 4$\\pi$. The same procedure applied to the Type 1 sub-sample returns no evidence for a significant signal in about 140 Ms stacked data in any of the adopted bands, confirming their surprisingly elusive nature in the X-ray band obtained with previous stacking experiments. A brief comparison with the current observations and the implications for the evolution of AGN are discussed.",

This model includes a Faraday-thin component at RM ~ - 0.3 rad/m^2 (instrumental leakage) and two external Faraday dispersion astrophysical emission at RM ~ - 47 rad/m^2.

At a redshift of $z = 0.409$ and magnified by a factor of $\\sim$68, extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations have been obtained. The explosion mechanism producing this rare event and differences compared to lower redshift supernovae however have not been explored in detail. Here we compare observations of iPTF16geu to existing radiative transfer simulations of type Ia supernova explosion models selected from the literature. We find that overall the DDC6 and PDDEL1 models, specific variations of the delayed detonation explosion scenario, produce the closest match to the light curves and many absorption features, but struggle to replicate the observed colours and in particular the rest-frame UV. We also investigate the magnification and reddening values required to improve agreement with the selected models. We find some evidence in favour of a UV flux excess that may be intrinsic to iPTF16geu or due to external factors such as host galaxy subtraction and uncertainties in the reddening law. Upcoming surveys will significantly increase the samples of SNe discovered at high redshifts due to strong gravitational lensing. These glSNe will enable tighter constraints on the explosion physics of type Ia supernovae and how this has evolved throughout the Universe.",

The complicated morphology of these waveforms due to the eccentric orbital timescale variations makes it difficult to construct accurate and efficient surrogate models, especially for waveforms long enough to cover the sensitivity band of the current ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We present a novel and scalable surrogate building technique which makes surrogate modeling of long-duration eccentric binary black hole waveforms both feasible and highly efficient. The technique aims to simplify the harmonic content of the intermediate eccentric surrogate data pieces by modeling them in terms of an angular orbital element called the mean anomaly, instead of time. We show that this novel parameterization yields an order of magnitude fewer surrogate basis functions than using the contemporary parameterization in terms of time. We show that variations in surrogate data-pieces across parameter space become much more regular when expressed in terms of the instantaneous waveform eccentricity and mean anomaly, greatly easing their parameter-space fitting.

AstroMMBench comprises 621 multiple-choice questions across six astrophysical subfields, curated and reviewed by 15 domain experts for quality and relevance. We conducted an extensive evaluation of 25 diverse MLLMs, including 22 open-source and 3 closed-source models, using AstroMMBench. The results show that Ovis2-34B achieved the highest overall accuracy (70.5%), demonstrating leading capabilities even compared to strong closed-source models. Performance showed variations across the six astrophysical subfields, proving particularly challenging in domains like cosmology and high-energy astrophysics, while models performed relatively better in others, such as instrumentation and solar astrophysics. These findings underscore the vital role of domain-specific benchmarks like AstroMMBench in critically evaluating MLLM performance and guiding their targeted development for scientific applications.

        "abstract": "The quasar main sequence (QMS), characterized by the Eigenvector 1 (EV1), serves as a unifying framework for classifying type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on their diverse spectral properties. Although a fully self-consistent physical interpretation has long been lacking, our physically motivated 2.5D FRADO (Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow) model naturally predicts that the Eddington ratio ($\\dot{m}$) is the primary physical driver of the QMS, with black hole mass ($M_{\\rm BH}$) and inclination ($i$) acting as secondary contributors. We employed a dense grid of FRADO simulations of the geometry and dynamics of the broad-line region (BLR), covering a representative range of $M_{\\rm BH}$ and $\\dot{m}$. For each simulation, we computed the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the H$\\beta$ line under different $i$. The resulting FWHM--$\\dot{m}$ diagram closely resembles the characteristic trend observed in the EV1 parameter space. This establishes the role of $\\dot{m}$ as the true proxy for the Fe II strength parameter ($R_{\\rm Fe}$), and vice versa. Our results suggest that $\\dot{m}$ can be regarded as the sole underlying physical tracer of $R_{\\rm Fe}$ and should therefore scale directly with it. The $M_{\\rm BH}$ accounts for the virial mass-related scatter in FWHM, while $i$ acts as a secondary driver modulating $R_{\\rm Fe}$ and FWHM for a given $\\dot{m}$ and $M_{\\rm BH}$.",

At a redshift $z=0.161$, it was detected by MAGIC telescopes approximately four hours since the trigger. VHE dataset was complied with the datasets of other wavelengths in between the timescale of 1.7 to 4 hours to construct the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). In previous studies of GRB~160821B, synchrotron and external Compton (EC) model could explain the VHE emission better than the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. Although, these fits were mostly eyeballing data without any optimisation. Our model includes the combination of synchrotron, SSC, and EC models with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Our analysis reveals that the EC contribution is negligible in comparison with the SSC and our model explains the VHE data well for the wind medium. We found that GRB~160821B is the least energetic VHE GRB and it occurred in high density wind medium which is quiet unusual for a short GRB. But like other long-duration VHE GRBs, GRB~160821B occurred in a poorly magnetised medium. As there is no statistical study on afterglow modelling of short GRB sample, we compare the inferred properties of GRB~160821B with other VHE GRBs. It stands out distinctively in the $E_{k, \\rm iso}$ - $\\epsilon_B$ parameter space and lies outside the 3-$\\sigma$ region of the correlation. In future, more VHE detections of short GRBs, in the CTA era, will provide crucial insights into the emission sites, radiation mechanisms, and particle acceleration, as well as their connection to long GRBs.",

In both cases, the dynamics introduce a nonextensivity parameter $\\delta$, with standard $\\Lambda$CDM recovered for $\\delta=1$. Previous studies have argued that only small deviations from extensivity are observationally allowed, typically constraining $|1 - \\delta| \\lesssim 10^{-3}$. In this work we go further and present, for the first time, a systematic consistency analysis across the entire expansion history. We show that even mild departures from $\\delta=1$ lead to pathological behavior in the effective dark energy sector: its density becomes negative or complex, its equation of state diverges, or alternatively it contributes an unacceptably large early-time fraction that spoils radiation domination and violates BBN and CMB bounds. Our results sharpen and unify earlier hints of tension, providing a clear physical explanation in terms of corrections that grow uncontrollably with expansion rate toward the past. We conclude that, within both the Cai-Kim and HDE frameworks, viable cosmology is realized only in the extensive limit, effectively collapsing the models back to $\\Lambda$CDM. More broadly, our findings call attention to the importance of dynamical consistency and cosmological viability tests when assessing nonextensive entropies as possible explanations of the Universe's dynamics.",

Using a set of models covering various parameter combinations, we were able to replicate the system's observed characteristics within acceptable error margins, including fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital period, donor luminosity, and effective temperature. The model results indicate the possibility of diverse evolutionary pathways for the system, highlighting the significant role played by the initial mass of the donor star and the efficiency of mass transfer episodes. While some models are well-aligned with estimates of the mass transfer rate, they all fall short of explaining the black hole's observed moderate spin ($a^* = 0.49$). We also explored alternative magnetic braking prescriptions, finding that only an extreme and fully conservative scenario, based on the convection and rotation boosted prescription, can reproduce the observed spin and only in a marginal way.

        "abstract": "Aims. We aim to confirm and measure the mass of the transiting planet candidate around the K5V star TOI-2093, previously announced by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) project. Methods. We combined photometric data from 32 sectors between 2019 and 2024 with 86 radial velocity measurements obtained with the CARMENES spectrograph over a period of 2.4 years, along with a series of ground-based, broadband photometric monitoring campaigns to characterize the host star and the transiting planet candidate, as well as to search for additional planets in the system. Our data indicate that TOI-2093 is a main-sequence star located at a distance of 83 pc, with solar metallicity, and a rotation period of 43.8 +- 1.8 d. Results. We have confirmed the planetary nature of the TESS transiting planet candidate, named TOI-2093 c, through the detection of its Keplerian signal in the spectroscopic data. We measured a planetary radius of 2.30 +- 0.12 Rearth, a Neptune-like mass of 15.8 +- 3.7 Mearth, and an orbital period of 53.81149 +- 0.00017 d. This makes TOI-2093 c the smallest exoplanet known in the habitable zone of a main-sequence FGK star. Given its size and relatively high density, TOI-2093 c belongs to a class of planets with no analog in the Solar System. In addition, the CARMENES data revealed the presence of a second planet candidate with a minimum mass of 10.6 +- 2.5 Mearth and an orbital period of 12.836 +- 0.021 d. This inner planet, which we designated TOI-2093 b, shows no detectable photometric transit in the TESS light curves. The orbital planes of the two planets are misaligned by more than 1.6 deg despite the near 4:1 mean-motion resonance of their orbital periods.",

        "abstract": "We explore a much-neglected area of SETI: solar system techno-signatures. As our cursory solar system exploration consolidates into commercial industrialisation, it is crucial that we determine what to look for and where. We first consider the rationale for interstellar self-replicating probes and their implications for the Fermi paradox. Whether for defensive or exploratory reasons, self-replicating probes are a rational strategy for Galactic investigation. We determine that self-replicating probes will systematically explore the Galaxy by tracking resources of sufficient metallicity. We focus on the resource requirements of a self-replicating interstellar probe that may have visited our solar system. After considering asteroid resources, we suggest that evidence of asteroidal processing will be difficult to discern from natural processes given the constraints imposed by self-replication. We further determine that the Moon is an ideal base of manufacturing operations. We suggest that nuclear reactors, such as the Magnox reactor model, can feasibly be constructed from lunar resources which will have left isotopic ratio signatures of Th-232/Nd-144 and/or Th-232/Ba-137. We further suggest that in anticipatory economic trade for resources, a self-replicating probe may have left artefacts buried with asteroidal resources on the Moon. Such gifts would be detectable and accessible only once a threshold of technological sophistication has been achieved. An obvious gift in trade for the resources utilised would be a universal constructor.",

This work explores the possibility that the X-ray flux is produced by accretion onto a white dwarf companion. We use three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to model the prototype gamma Cas system assuming a white dwarf companion and investigate the accretion of the circumstellar material by the secondary star. We contrast these results to a model for 59 Cyg, a non-gamma Cas Be star system with a stripped companion. We find that the secondary stars in both systems form disk-like accretion structures with Keplerian characteristics, similar to those seen in the Be decretion disks. We also find that white dwarf accretion can produce X-ray fluxes that are consistent with the observed values for gamma Cas, while the predicted X-ray luminosities are significantly lower for the non-degenerate companion in 59 Cyg. In addition, using the three-dimensional radiative transfer code, HDUST, we find that these models produce H-alpha emission consistent with the observations for both gamma Cas and 59 Cyg, and that the predicted polarization degrees across optical and UV wavelengths are at detectable levels. Finally, we discuss the impact that future UV spectropolarimetry missions could have on our understanding of these systems.",

Analyzing jet components in these maps traditionally involves manual Gaussian fitting, a time-consuming bottleneck for large datasets. To address this, we present an automated batch-processing tool, based on the Gaussian fitting capabilities of CASA, designed to streamline VLBI jet component characterization (AAP-Imfit). Our algorithm sets a detection limit, performs automatic 2D Gaussian fitting, and removes model artifacts, efficiently extracting component flux densities and positions. This method enables systematic and reproducible analysis, significantly reducing the time required for fitting extensive VLBI datasets. We validated AAP-Imfit by using VLBI observations of the blazars 3C 279 and 3C 454.3, comparing our results with published fits. The close agreement in residual root mean square (RMS) values and model/residual-to-map RMS ratios confirms the accuracy of our automated approach in reproducing original flux distributions. While visual inspection remains important for complex or faint features, this routine significantly accelerates VLBI component fitting, paving the way for large-scale statistical studies of jet dynamics.",

In this work, we consider such a class of Newton couplings and look for the possible observational implications on the highly lensed images of the black holes. In addition to placing constraints on the parameter space of the model through the latest Sgr A* images, we find that the variations in the shape of shadows in a large portion of the parameter space can be qualitatively captured by a quantity solely defined by the event horizon. Most importantly, the consistency of thermodynamics suggests a lower bound on the shadow size, beyond which either horizon disappears, or the shadow cannot keep the standard D-shaped structure. The possibility that the black holes in this model could spin faster than the Kerr bound, and the physical implications of the resulting cuspy shadows, are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "The black hole in the Galactic Center, Sgr A*, is prototypical for ultra-low-fed galactic nuclei. The discovery of a hand-full of gas clumps in the realm of a few Earth masses in its immediate vicinity provides a gas reservoir sufficient to power Sgr A*. In particular, the gas cloud G2 is of interest due to its extreme orbit, on which it passed at a pericenter distance of around 100 AU and notably lost kinetic energy during the fly-by due to the interaction with the black hole accretion flow. 13 years prior to G2, a resembling gas cloud called G1, passed Sgr A* on a similar orbit. The origin of G2 remained a topic of discussion, with models including a central (stellar) source still proposed as alternatives to pure gaseous clouds. Here, we report the orbit of a third gas clump moving again along (almost) the same orbital trace. Since the probability of finding three stars on close orbits is very small, this strongly argues against stellar-based source models. Instead, we show that the gas streamer G1-2-3 plausibly originates from the stellar wind of the massive binary star IRS16SW. This claim is substantiated by the fact that the small differences between the three orbits - the orientations of the orbital ellipses in their common plane as a function of time - are consistent with the orbital motion of IRS 16SW.",

        "abstract": "Blazars are active galactic nuclei known for their extreme variability, offering unique opportunities to study jet physics and high-energy emission mechanisms. In 2024, the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) OP313 underwent a remarkable flare event, during which the gamma-ray flux observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi/LAT) increased by a factor of 60 over its average value. The flare peak lasted less than two days. Using optical telescopes, we conducted 100-day time-scale observations. Multi-wavelength data revealed that OP313 entered an active state 50 days prior to the flare and remained active for at least 50 days afterward. We propose that this prolonged activity results from variations in electron density within the shock front due to changes in the accretion rate. Concurrently, OP313's spectrum transitioned from an FSRQ-like state to a BL Lac-like state, characterized by a significant increase in the synchrotron peak frequency and the disappearance of broad-line region emission lines. In the post-flare phase, we observed a decoupling between synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering, along with a possible decrease in the magnetic field strength within the shock front.",

        "abstract": "To model the structure and dynamics of the heliosphere well enough for high-quality forecasting, it is essential to accurately estimate the global solar magnetic field used as inner boundary condition in solar wind models. However, our understanding of the photospheric magnetic field topology is inherently constrained by the limitation of systematically observing the Sun from only one vantage point, Earth. To address this challenge, we introduce global magnetic field maps that assimilate far-side active regions derived from helioseismology into solar wind modeling. Through a comparative analysis between the combined surface flux transport and helioseismic Far-side Active Region Model (FARM) magnetic maps and the base surface flux transport model without far-side active regions (SFTM), we assess the feasibility and efficacy of incorporating helio-seismic far-side information in space weather forecasting. We are employing the Wang-Sheeley-Arge Solar Wind (WSA) model for statistical evaluation and leveraging the three-dimensional heliospheric MHD model, EUHFORIA, to analyze a case study. Using the WSA model, we show that including far-side magnetic data improves solar wind forecasts for 2013-2014 by up to 50% in correlation and 3% in Root Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Error, especially near Earth and STEREO-A. Additionally, our 3D modeling shows significant localized differences in heliospheric structure that can be attributed to the presence or absence of active regions in the magnetic maps used as input boundaries. This highlights the importance of including far-side information to more accurately model and predict space weather effects caused by solar wind, solar transients, and geomagnetic disturbances.",

Solar Orbiter offers an unprecedented second vantage point for observing the Sun. When combined with observations from the perspective of Earth, this enables simultaneous dual-viewpoint measurements of these magnetic structures, thereby helping to mitigate observational limitations. Using such a dual-viewpoint geometry, we characterise the brightness contrast of faculae near the limb as a function of both their associated magnetic field strength and the observation angle. We analyse data from Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager on board Solar Orbiter (SO/PHI), obtained during an observation program conducted in near-quadrature configuration with Earth, in combination with data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI). The High Resolution Telescope of SO/PHI observed a facular region located near disc centre as seen from its vantage point, while the same region was simultaneously observed near the solar limb by SDO/HMI. We identify faculae and determine their magnetic field strength from the disc-centre observations, and combine these with continuum intensity measurements at the limb to derive dual-viewpoint contrast curves. We then compare these with contrast curves derived from SDO/HMI alone. Using two viewpoints, we consistently find higher facular contrast near the limb than from a single-viewpoint.",

Focussing on the static, spherically symmetric case we utilize metrics of non-singular black holes that are accompanied by a regulator length scale $L > 0$. The choice $L \\gtrsim GM$ generically removes the horizon from these metrics leading to compact, horizonless but non-singular objects. This generically guarantees the existence of a stable orbit at small radii $r \\ll r_\\text{ISCO}$, independent of the angular momentum of the massive particle. Crucially, the absence of a horizon allows the resulting VHFQPO's to escape to infinity, spanning the range from 1kHz ($M = 10M_\\odot$) to 25 kHz ($M = 2M_\\odot$). Within the paradigm of non-singular spacetime geometries, the absence of such VHFQPO's from X-ray binary spectra implies the presence of a horizon around the central, compact object.",

        "abstract": "The calwf3 software for WFC3/UVIS utilizes a reference file to flag pixels that are saturated beyond their full-well depth. Previously, this was accomplished using a constant threshold of 65,500 e$^{-}$ across the entire detector. In this study, we retrieved $\\sim$1 million stars from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) to determine the flux level at which the Point Spread Function begins to flatten, which occurs as the central pixel saturates. We quantified the saturation limit as a function of position on the detector in 1,024 discrete regions, and interpolated to a pixel-by-pixel saturation map to construct a spatially-variable saturation map reference file that is now implemented in the calwf3 calibration pipeline. We find the saturation varies by 13% across the UVIS detectors, from 63,465 e$^{-}$ to 72,356 e$^{-}$. These values agree well with earlier studies using sparser datasets, with the current analysis leading to improved characterization on small scales. Critically, the revised saturation values are larger than the previous constant threshold over 87% of the UVIS detector, leading to the recovery of usable science pixels near bright sources. This update greatly improves the robustness of saturation flags in the Data Quality arrays of observations obtained with WFC3/UVIS, and users are encouraged to redownload their data from MAST to benefit from the improved flags.",

        "abstract": "The solar atmosphere is permeated by various types of waves that originate from subsurface convection. As these waves propagate upward, they encounter they encounter a steep decrease in the density of the medium, leading to their steepening into shock waves. These shock waves typically exhibit a characteristic sawtooth pattern in wavelength-time ($\\lambda$-t) plots of various chromospheric spectral lines, viz., H$\\alpha$, Ca II 8542 {\\AA} to name a few. In this study, we investigate the propagation of shock waves in the lower solar atmosphere using coordinated observations from the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope (SST), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Our analysis reveals that after forming in the chromosphere, these shock waves travel upward through the solar atmosphere, with their signatures detectable not only in the transition region but also in low coronal passbands. These shock waves dissipate their energy into the chromosphere as they propagate. In certain cases, the energy deposited by these waves is comparable to the radiative losses of the chromosphere, highlighting their potential role in chromospheric heating. Our findings reported here provide crucial insights into wave dynamics in the lower solar atmosphere and their contribution to the energy transport process in the chromosphere.",

Cosmic rays that achieve the highest energies are rare, and their flux at Earth is extremely low.

Although observation time is limited compared with ground particle detectors, it enables direct measurements of $X_\\mathrm{max}$, a crucial parameter sensitive to the primary cosmic-ray composition. FAST will achieve large-area coverage by significantly reducing the cost of telescopes. This necessitates a simplified telescope compared to conventional designs. Demonstrating the feasibility of our telescope and observational method is essential.

The TES arrays are packaged into Universal Focal-Plane Modules (UFMs), which also contain the multiplexing readout circuit.

Each routing wafer hosts twelve bias lines, which contain the ${\\sim}$400 ${\\mu}{\\Omega}$ shunt resistors that are part of the TES bias circuitry. More than 70 routing wafers have been fabricated and tested both at room temperature and 100 mK before integration into UFMs. The lab measurements for all screened wafers have been compiled to show the distribution of measured average shunt resistance Rsh for each bias line, both across bias lines on a single routing wafer and across all routing wafers. The mean average shunt resistance for all wafers was found to be 396 ${\\mu}{\\Omega}$ with a standard deviation of 16 ${\\mu}{\\Omega}$, or ${\\sim}$4%. For each wafer, we note good uniformity of average Rsh between bias lines, with a slight downward trend with increasing distance from the center of the wafer.

We use simple examples to demonstrate the invalidity and prior sensitivity of this approach. We review the standard Bayesian interpretation of the Bayes factor as an odds ratio and recommend its use in conjunction with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Predictive Information Criterion Simplified (BPICS) in future analyses (Python implementations are included) . As a concrete example, we refit the WASP-39 b NIRSpec transmission spectrum to test for the presence of SO$_2$. The prevalent, incorrect significance calculation gives $3.67\\sigma$ whereas the standard Bayesian interpretation yields a null model probability $p(\\mathcal{B}|y)=0.0044$. Surveying the exoplanet atmosphere literature, we find widespread use of the erroneous formula.

        "abstract": "A number of cosmic shear studies have reported results that are in mild tension with the Planck cosmic microwave measurement. To explore if this can be caused by biases in the shear estimation, we revisit the analysis of data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) using an alternative shape measurement pipeline that is more robust to uncertainties in the calibration. To this end, we present an implementation of MetaCalibration, and compare its performance to that of lensfit, which has been used in previous analyses of these data. We find that the multiplicative bias is reduced, especially for the most distant redshifts, as derived from multi-band image simulations designed to match the KiDS data (SURFS-based KiDS-Legacy-Like Simulations: SKiLLS). For all tomographic bins we obtain a multiplicative bias $|m|<0.017$, with negligible additive bias. Importantly, the calibration has a negligible sensitivity to key galaxy properties. The resulting robust shear estimates were used to obtain cosmological parameter constraints. We find that the parameter $S_8\\equiv \\sigma_8 \\sqrt{\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}/0.3} =0.789_{-0.024}^{+0.020}$ is consistent with the previous KiDS-1000 lensfit constraint of $S_8=0.776^{+0.029 +0.002}_{-0.027-0.003}$ (statistical + systematic errors). Thanks to the higher effective source density, the constraining power is improved by about 28%. The difference in $S_8$ with the Planck value remains at a similar level, 1.8$\\sigma$, implying that it is not caused by the shear measurements.",

Different choices for defining the hyperonic couplings with different levels of parametric freedom are discussed. In all models, the predicted NS maximum masses are reduced compared with the purely nucleonic composition as expected. In the case of relating hyperonic couplings via $SU(6)$-symmetry arguments to the nucleonic ones, we find that NS radii for intermediate mass stars are shifted to higher values compared with purely nucleonic stars, in agreement with the existing literature. However, allowing for more freedom for the hyperonic couplings, the effect is strongly reduced, and the distributions in the NS mass-radius plane of models with and without hyperons become very close. We have also investigated how different nucleonic density functionals influence the hyperon matter composition and neutron star properties.",

        "abstract": "The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is host to gas flows into and out of galaxies and regulates galaxy growth, but the multiphase, diffuse gas in this region is challenging to observe. We investigate the properties of gas giving rise to O VI emission from the CGM that upcoming missions, such as the Aspera SmallSat, will be able to map in local galaxies. We use the FOGGIE simulations to predict the O VI emission from edge-on galaxies across the redshift range $z=1\\rightarrow0$. O VI emission is brightest surrounding small, clumpy structures near the galaxy where the gas density is high. Most of the O VI surface brightness originates from collisionally ionized, $T\\sim10^{5.5}$ K, inflowing gas and is not preferentially aligned with the major or minor axis of the galaxy disk. Simulated galaxies with higher halo masses, higher median CGM gas density, and higher star formation rates produce brighter and more widespread O VI emission in their CGM. We show that while O VI emission primarily originates in inflowing gas, turning off outflows in a simulation without star formation feedback eliminates most of the O VI emission. Enrichment from feedback is necessary to mix with the inflowing gas and allow it to glow in O VI. Collectively, our findings point towards a picture where O VI emission traces warm, ionized envelopes of cooler clouds that are accreting onto the galaxy in a metal-enriched galactic fountain. Finally, we show that the detection limit of Aspera is sufficient to detect O VI emission tens of kpc from the galaxy center for $\\sim L^\\star$ galaxies.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the diversity of star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies is key to reconstructing their evolutionary paths. Traditional models often assume parametric forms such as delayed-tau or exponentially declining models, which may not reflect the actual variety of formation processes. We aim to assess what types of SFHs are consistent with the observed present-day star formation rates (${\\text{SFR}}_0$) and time-averaged star formation rates ($\\langle \\text{SFR} \\rangle$) of galaxies in the Local Volume, without assuming any fixed functional form. We construct a non-parametric framework by generating large ensembles of randomized SFHs for each galaxy in the sample. For each SFH, we compute its predicted stellar mass and present-day SFR and retain only those consistent with the observed values within a 20% tolerance. We then infer the statistical distribution of power-law slopes $\\eta$ (fitted as ${\\text{SFR}}(t) \\propto (t-t_{\\text{start}})^\\eta$) and 50% stellar mass formation times $t_{50}$. Both $\\eta$ and $t_{50}$ correlate strongly with the SFR ratio (Spearman $\\rho > 0.75$, $p \\ll 10^{-16}$), indicating that the shape and timing of star formation are primarily governed by this ratio. The $t_{50}$ distribution shows sharp spikes near 7.74 and 7.86 Gyr, which we attribute to grid discretization combined with filtering, rather than a physical bimodality. Our results confirm that strongly declining SFH templates are disfavored in the Local Volume: most systems are consistent with flat long-term SFHs, with only mild decline or occasional rising. Importantly, this is demonstrated through a fully model-independent, data-driven approach, with per-galaxy uncertainties quantified using the standard error of $\\eta$ and $t_{50}$ from the ensemble of accepted SFHs.",

Our study focuses on how assembly history governs the structural and kinematic diversity of dwarf galaxies within the $\\Lambda$CDM framework. The simulated galaxies reproduce the observed stellar-to-halo mass, mass--metallicity, and size--mass relations, yielding stellar masses of $10^6-10^8\\,M_\\odot$ and metallicities consistent with those of Local Group dwarf galaxies. The galaxies display a broad range of rotational support, where gas is generally more rotationally supported than stars. Differences in morphology and kinematics primarily reflect variations in halo assembly timescales and merger activity. Early-assembling, high-concentration halos form stars efficiently and become gas-poor by $z=0$, while late-assembling, low-concentration halos remain gas-rich due to delayed star formation and rejuvenated gas accretion. We identify a clear anti-correlation between rotational support and the cumulative merger mass fraction, demonstrating that dynamical heating by mergers is the dominant factor shaping kinematic diversity. In some cases, late-time mergers induce the formation of extended gas disks by delivering fresh gas and angular momentum. These results demonstrate that assembly history, rather than halo mass alone, critically shapes the present-day kinematic and morphological diversity of dwarf galaxies.",

Furthermore, the interaction of convection with oscillations prevent us from accurately predicting seismic frequencies, and therefore from fully exploiting the asteroseismic data of low-mass stars. We aim to develop a new formalism to model the one-point statistics of stellar convection, to implement it in a new numerical code, and to validate this implementation against benchmark cases. This new formalism is based on Lagrangian Probability Density Function (PDF) methods, where a Fokker-Planck equation for the PDF of particle-based turbulent properties is integrated in time. We then develop a Monte-Carlo implementation of this method, where the flow is represented by a large number of notional particles acting as realisations of the PDF. Notional particles interact with each other through the time- and space-dependent mean flow, which is estimated from the particle realisations through a scheme similar to Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. We establish a model for the evolution of turbulent properties along Lagrangian trajectories applicable to stellar turbulent convection, with only a minimal number of physical assumptions necessary to close the system. In particular, no closure is needed for the non-linear advection terms, which are included exactly through the Lagrangian nature of formalism. The numerical implementation of this new formalism allows us to extract time-dependent maps of the statistical properties of turbulent convection in a way which is not possible in grid-based large-eddy simulations, in particular the turbulent pressure, Reynolds stress tensor, internal energy variance and convective flux.",

We measure [Eu/Fe] abundance ratios in 209 giant stars that are confirmed members of the SMC, providing the first extensive dataset of Eu abundances in this galaxy across its full metallicity range, spanning more than 1.5 dex. We compare Eu abundances with those of Mg and Ba to evaluate the efficiency of the r-process relative to $\\alpha$-capture and s-process nucleosynthesis. The SMC shows enhanced [Eu/Fe] values at all metallicities (comparable with the values measured in the Milky Way), with a clear decline as [Fe/H] increases (from $\\sim$ -1.75 dex to $\\sim$ -0.5 dex), consistent with the onset of Type Ia supernovae. In contrast, [Eu/Mg] is enhanced by about +0.5 dex at all [Fe/H], significantly above the values observed in Milky Way stars, where [Eu/Mg] remains close to solar, reflecting comparable production of r-process and $\\alpha$-capture elements. Moreover, [Ba/Eu] increases with metallicity, beginning at [Fe/H] $\\approx$ -1.5 dex, namely at a lower metallicity with respect to the Milky Way, where [Ba/Eu] starts to increase around [Fe/H] $\\approx$ -1 dex. Our findings suggest the SMC has a higher production of Eu (with respect to the $\\alpha$-elements) than the Milky Way but in line with what observed in other dwarf systems within the Local Group. We confirm that galaxies with star formation efficiencies lower than the Milky Way have high [Eu/$\\alpha$], probably indicating a stronger efficiency of the delayed sources of r-process at low metallicities.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge in modeling classical Cepheids is the treatment of convection, particularly its complex interplay with pulsation. This inherently three-dimensional process is typically approximated in one-dimensional hydrocodes using dimensionless turbulent convection (TC) free parameters. Calibrating these parameters is essential for reproducing key observational features such as light-curve amplitudes, secondary bumps, and the red edge of the instability strip. In this work, we calibrate TC parameters adopted in the publicly available MESA-RSP code through comparison with both observational data of classical Cepheids and stellar parameter constraints from the Stellingwerf code. We compute multi-band (V, I, and Ks) MESA-RSP light curves for 18 observed Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids, using stellar parameters determined from the Stellingwerf code. By fine-tuning the mixing-length and eddy viscosity parameters, we calibrate the TC treatment in MESA-RSP. We then compare the resulting period-luminosity (PL), period-radius (PR), and period-mass-radius (PMR) relations with predictions from the Stellingwerf models. We successfully reproduce multi-band light curves and obtain PL, PR, and PMR relations consistent with Ragosta et al. (2019). While in broad agreement with previous work, we explicitly identify distinct mass-luminosity (ML) relations for fundamental-mode and first-overtone Cepheids for the first time. This suggests that the macroscopic processes affecting the ML relation depend on stellar mass and/or effective temperature range. Although our study focuses on the calibration of TC parameters, we do not find a single set of parameter values that reproduces all light curves. No statistically significant correlation is found between stellar properties and convection parameters, although subtle trends with period and effective temperature may be present.",

In this work, we investigate the temporal evolution of key indicators of dynamical relaxation, with particular emphasis on the secular growth of the diffuse intragroup light (IGL), the four major group galaxies, and the mass distributions of their progenitors. We also assess the diagnostic power of several magnitude gaps between top-ranked galaxies as proxies for dynamical age. As in our previous study, we compare outcomes from three group classes defined by the number of brightest group galaxies (BGGs) present at the end of the simulations. The early assembly of galaxy groups is consistent with a stochastic Poisson process at an approximately constant merger rate. Various dynamical diagnostics - including galaxy pairwise separations, velocity dispersions, and the offset of the first-ranked galaxy from the group barycentre - indicate that single-BGG groups evolve more rapidly towards virialisation than double- and especially non-BGG systems. We further find that first-ranked group members and the IGL, follow distinct growth histories, with the IGL assembled from a more numerous and systematically lower-mass population than the central object. This distinction is particularly pronounced in non-BGG systems, where about one third of the IGL originates from small galaxies, each contributing less than 5% to this component. Among the tested magnitude gaps, the difference between the first- and fourth-ranked galaxies, $\\Delta M4-1$, proves a more robust indicator of dynamical age for low-mass groups than the conventional $\\Delta M2-1$ gap.

We present 'single-zone' analytic solutions for the chemical evolution of galaxies when the stellar yields are metallicity-dependent. Our solutions assume a constant star formation efficiency, a constant mass-loading factor and that the yields are linearly dependent on the interstellar medium abundance (with the option of a saturation of the yields at high metallicity). We demonstrate how the metallicity dependence of the yields can be mathematically considered as a system-dependent delay time (approximately equal to the system's depletion time) that, when combined with system-independent delay times arising from stellar evolutionary channels, produces the separation of different systems based on their star formation efficiency and mass-loading factor. The utility of the models is highlighted through comparisons with data from the APOGEE spectroscopic survey. We provide a comprehensive discussion of the chemical evolution models in the [Al/Fe]-[Mg/Fe] plane, a diagnostic plane for the separation of in-situ and accreted Galactic components.

        "abstract": "Mass loss shapes the fate of massive stars; however, the physical mechanism causing it remains uncertain. We present a comprehensive analysis of seven red supergiants, for which we searched evidence of episodic mass loss, in three low-metallicity galaxies: NGC~6822, IC~10, and WLM. Initially, the spectral classification of their optical spectra was refined and compared to previous reported classifications, finding four sources that display spectral variability. We derived the physical properties of five of them using the \\textsc{marcs} atmospheric models corrected for nonlocal thermal equilibrium effects to measure stellar properties from our new near-infrared spectra, such as the effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and microturbulent velocity. Additional empirical and theoretical methods were employed to calculate effective temperatures, finding consistent results. We constructed optical and infrared light curves, discovering two targets in NGC~6822 with photometric variability between 1 and 2.5 mag in amplitude in r and ~ 0.5 mag in the mid-infrared. Furthermore, we discovered a candidate-dimming event in one of these sources. Periods for three red supergiants were determined using epoch photometry, which were consistent with the empirical estimations from literature period-luminosity relations. Our comprehensive analysis of all the available data for each target provides evidence for episodic mass loss in four red supergiants.",

Two-dimensional simulations confirm DDT and demonstrate that the multidimensional cellular structure of the oxygen detonation can promote carbon detonation at somewhat lower densities than in one dimension.

        "abstract": "The interplay between the accretion of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the stellar mass growth of the host galaxies is still a matter of hot debate. The accretion of the SMBHs is expected to release energy under the form of AGNs. This energy is believed to impact the star formation activity and contribute to the quenching of galaxies. Here, we address this key unsolved issue with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE. In DECODE, we grow galaxies with their SFR linked to halo accretion rate distributions via abundance matching. SMBHs are evolved following the stellar mass growth of their host galaxies by assigning an accretion rate at each redshift from the empirical Eddington ratio distributions and duty cycles. We test the assumption that galaxies permanently quench when their central SMBHs approach the limit imposed by the observed $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma_\\star$ relation, as a proxy of SMBH disruptive feedback. We find that simply imposing the $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma_\\star$ condition is sufficient to generate a fraction of quenched galaxies consistent with current data, including the newest ones from Euclid. In addition, our minimal, data-driven model, also predicts SMBH scaling relations consistent in slope and normalisation with those observed, and an $M_{\\rm BH} - M_\\star$ relation weakly evolving with redshift. The model also naturally generates SMBH accretion rates peaking within 1 Gyr of their host SFHs. We note that all the main predictions on galaxy quenched fractions and SMBH growth histories and scaling relations are degenerate with those expected in a halo quenching model. The comprehensive data-driven model presented in this work represents an invaluable tool to investigate SMBH demography across time and environments in an accurate, physically motivated manner, ideally suited to rapidly explore the implications from large surveys, such as Euclid and Rubin-LSST.",

These fields correlate with supernova (SN)-driven turbulence, but whether the scaling is universal across galaxy properties, ISM phases, and energy budgets remains unclear. We quantify the dependence of magnetic fields on star formation activity including both regular and starburst galaxies. We analyse 19 spiral disks from the cosmological RTnsCRiMHD Azahar suite, deriving line-of-sight integrated maps to measure median magnetic-field strength ($B$), specific energies (thermal, turbulent, magnetic, and cosmic-ray), and star formation rate (SFR), star formation surface density ($\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SFR}}$) and specific SFR (sSFR). We find an almost universal magnetic-field-SFR scaling with slope $\\alpha \\approx 0.2$-$0.3$ across galaxy mass and ISM phases. The $B$-$\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SFR}}$ slope ($\\alpha \\approx 1/3$) supports an SN-driven, turbulence-regulated origin.

We perform ALMA $870~\\mu$m dust continuum polarization and CO(3-2) emission line polarization, and report the first detection of CO(3-2) emission line polarization through the Goldreich-Kylafis effect in an outflow. Dust polarization shows that Arp 220 E has a spiral-like B-field on the disk with a linear polarization fraction of $0.4\\pm0.1$% that may produce the detected circular polarization passing through foreground aligned dust grains. Arp 220 W reveals a B-field parallel to the red- and blueshifted outflows in both the dust and emission line polarization maps. The outflows show a dust polarization of $0.2$%, while the CO(3-2) emission line polarization is $1-2$% at $4-6\\sigma$ significance across independent velocity channels. A highly polarized ($3-5$%) dusty bridge has a B-field orientation of $\\sim110^{\\circ}$ connecting both nuclei. Mean B-field strengths of $1.6$ mG and $8$ mG for the blue- and redshifted outflows, respectively, are estimated. These strong B-fields are attributed to amplification by compression in nuclear clouds and supernova remnants. This amplified B-field is likely sustained by the turbulent kinetic energy in the outflow and may be critical in directing the transport of metals and cosmic rays into the circumgalactic medium.",

We combine our results with previous works to estimate the age and age spread of each population.

Additionally, we connect for the first time the Chromosome Diagram to the two-stream age-metallicity relation, allowing us to link the P1 and P2 stars to the distinct star formation tracks, proposed to be in-situ and ex-situ contributions to the cluster's assembly. Our results are consistent with some suggested formation models and rule out others but no current model can explain all observed features of the subpopulations.",

Multi-wavelength archival data was used to consistently apply all of these methods to every galaxy within this compiled set. The cross application of these methods resulted in a diversity of sub-populations identified as active by some set of these techniques. In this paper, we estimate host galaxy properties from spectral energy distribution models. We connect the active galactic nuclei (AGN) signatures to our estimated host galaxies' properties using statistical dimensionality reduction methods. We find that dwarf AGN selected by infrared colors are the most distinct population, with the highest star formation rates and lowest stellar masses. We also find some other key population differences, such as the broad line AGN having significantly higher AGN luminosities. X-ray and variability selected AGN have higher average star formation rates than those selected with optical narrow line spectroscopic diagrams.

        "abstract": "We use the full-disk VLT-MUSE mosaic of NGC 253 to identify 2492 HII regions and study their resolved structure. With an average physical resolution of 17 pc, this is one of the largest samples of highly resolved spectrally mapped extragalactic HII regions. Regions of all luminosities exhibit a characteristic emission profile described by a double Gaussian with a marginally resolved or unresolved core with radius <10 pc surrounded by a more extended halo of emission with radius 20-30 pc. Approximately 80% of the emission of a region originates from the halo component. As a result of this compact structure, the luminosity-radius relations for core and effective radii of HII regions depend sensitively on the adopted methodology. Only the isophotal radius yields a robust relationship in NGC 253, but this measurement has an ambiguous physical meaning. We invert the measured emission profiles to infer density profiles and find central densities of n_e = 10-100 cm-3. In the brightest regions, these agree well with densities inferred from the [SII]6716,30 doublet. The central density of HII regions correlates well with the surface brightness within the effective radius. We show that this same scaling relation applies to the recent MUSE+HST catalog for 19 nearby galaxies. We also discuss potential limitations, including completeness, impacts of background subtraction and spatial resolution, and the generality of our results when applied to other galaxies.",

It is now possible using the apsidal motion rate in close eccentric binaries! The apsidal motion rate depends on the tidal interactions occurring between the stars and is proportional to k2, a measure of the star's inner density profile. Confronting standard stellar models with observations reveals the famous k2-discrepancy: models predict too high a k2 for the stars, that is to say, stars with too low a density contrast between their core and envelope. We built bespoke GENEC stellar evolution models including tidal mixing for the twin massive binary HD 152248. The models reveal the instabilities allowing to reproduce the stellar density profiles: advecto-diffusive models better reproduce k2 than magnetic models. A large overshooting is necessary to converge towards the observed k2, yet alone is not sufficient. While a change in metallicity or mass-loss rate has no significant impact on k2, a larger initial helium abundance allows us to better reproduce the k2. Yet, a super-solar helium abundance is not observationally supported. Our analyses highlight the need for a process in the stars that slows down the radial expansion.",

        "abstract": "FAST HI observations reveal unprecedented internal structures of the high-velocity cloud AC-III, which is found to consist of several coherent subclumps (D1--D6) with nearly constant line widths of $\\sim 20~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, while the global velocity spread ranges from $-220$ to $-180~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$. These subclumps exhibit parabolic morphologies, consistent with ram-pressure--confined droplets, with their heads tending to point toward the Galactic plane. A steady-state model reproduces both the morphology and the observed exponential density profiles. The tip density reaches $\\sim 2~\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, implying an ambient medium density of $\\sim 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, in agreement with the Galactic warm ionized medium at a distance of $\\sim 5$~kpc. Deviations from symmetric droplet shapes, along with internal patterns such as strip-like ridges, rings, and holes, indicate rich internal dynamics. In particular, the observations are consistent with fluid loops forming inside the droplets in response to interactions between neighboring subclumps. These loops can generate ring-like dynamic patterns and drive secondary turbulence, sustaining long-lived internal motions. An intermediate-velocity component ($-150$ to $-100~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) exhibits a shell-like morphology aligned with the head of AC-III, possibly shaped by pressure interactions mediated by the WIM. Overall, we suggest that HVC AC-III is entering the Galactic WIM layer and being sculpted by ram pressure into a droplet-like morphology, providing a valuable case for studying the structure formation, turbulence origin, and dynamic evolution of HVCs, as well as the physical properties of the ambient medium.",

The solver models anisotropic viscous transport along magnetic field lines following the Braginskii formulation and includes physically motivated limiters based on the mirror and firehose instability thresholds, which constrain the viscous stress in weakly collisional plasmas. To validate the implementation, we performed a suite of standard test problems -- including two variants of the sound-wave test, circularly and linearly polarized Alfven waves, fast magnetosonic wave, and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability -- both with and without the plasma-instability limiters. The results show excellent agreement with the AREPO implementation of a similar anisotropic viscosity model (Berlok et al. 2019), confirming the accuracy and robustness of our method. Our formulation integrates seamlessly within the individual adaptive timestepping framework of OpenGadget3, avoiding the need for subcycling. This provides efficient and stable time integration while maintaining physical consistency. Finally, we applied the new solver to a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy cluster, demonstrating its capability to model anisotropic transport and plasma microphysics in realistic large-scale environments. Our implementation offers a versatile and computationally efficient tool for studying anisotropic viscosity in magnetized astrophysical systems.",

However, existing observations only yield the total amount of dust emission along the line of sight (LoS), with no information on its LoS distribution. Aims. We present a new method designed to give access to the LoS distribution of the dust emission, both in terms of intensity and polarization. Methods. We relied on three kinematic gas tracers (HI, 12CO, and 13CO emission lines) to identify the different clouds present along the LoS. We decomposed the measured intensity of the dust emission, $I_d$, into separate contributions from these clouds. We performed a similar decomposition of the measured Stokes parameters for linear polarization, $Q_d$ and $U_d$, to derive the polarization parameters of the different clouds, and from this we inferred the clouds' magnetic field orientations. Results. We applied our method to a $3~{\\rm deg}^2$ region of the sky, centered on $(l,b) = (139{\\deg}30',-3{\\deg}16')$ and exhibiting signs of star formation activity. We found this region to be dominated by an extended and bright cloud with nearly horizontal magnetic field, as expected from the nearly vertical polarization angles measured by Planck. More importantly, we detected the presence of two smaller, depolarizing molecular clouds with very different magnetic field orientations in the plane of the sky ($\\simeq 65{\\deg}$ and $\\simeq 45{\\deg}$ from the horizontal). This is a novel and viable result, which cannot be directly read off the Planck polarization maps. Conclusions. The application of our method to the G139 region convincingly demonstrates the need to complement 2D polarization maps with 3D kinematic information when looking for reliable estimates of magnetic field orientations.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel technique to decompose line-of-sight (LOS) stellar polarization as a function of distance, aimed at reconstructing three dimensional (3D) plane-of-sky (POS) magnetic structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). The method assumes that the observed polarization arises from discrete, thin dust layers located at varying distances along the LOS. Using a simple frequentist framework, it identifies structural changes in the distance-sorted cumulative Mahalanobis distance of Stokes parameters (q and u) to detect the locations of dust layers and estimate their associated physical properties (parallax and Stokes parameters) necessary to construct 3D maps. We benchmark the method using mock datasets representative of high-Galactic-latitude regions, incorporating realistic Gaia parallax uncertainties and polarization expected from the upcoming Pasiphae survey. Tests show that the method reliably recovers dust cloud distances and polarization properties when the polarization exceeds 0.1%, and the effective background-star fraction is greater than 10% in samples of about 345 stars. The dependence on background fraction decreases as the intrinsic polarization amplitude of the dust field increases. We apply our method to existing polarization data from two illustrative sightlines, one at intermediate-high Galactic latitude and one near the Galactic plane, with known tomographic solutions, finding excellent agreement with the literature and demonstrating its accuracy across both regions. Comparing with the BISP-1 approach, both methods effectively recover dust cloud properties, but our approach is prior-free and computationally more efficient in determining the optimal number of clouds along the LOS. These advantages make it flexible and broadly applicable for multi-layer dust cloud reconstruction for the upcoming era of large-scale stellar polarization surveys.",

However, the spatial scales over which the initial conditions can exert a significant influence are not well constrained. We report the first evidence for parsec-scale spatial correlations of stellar magnetospheric inclinations ($i_{\\rm mag}$), observed in the Lupus low-mass star forming region. Applying consensus clustering with a hierarchical density-based clustering algorithm, we demonstrate that the detected spatial dependencies are stable against perturbations by measurement uncertainties. The $i_{\\rm mag}$ correlation scales are on the order of ~3 pc, which aligns with the typical scales of the Lupus molecular cloud filaments. Our results reveal a connection between large-scale forces -- in the form of expanding shells from the Upper Scorpius and Upper-Centaurus-Lupus regions -- and sub-au scale system configurations. We find that Lupus has a non-uniform $i_{\\rm mag}$ distribution and suggest that this results from the preferential elongation of protostellar cores along filamentary axes. Non-uniformity would have significant implications for exoplanet occurrence rate calculations, so future work should explore the longevity of these biases driven by the star-cloud connection.",

How this evolution depends on protostellar physical properties remains unclear. We investigate the chemical content of 22 well-studied massive protostars from the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation survey, aiming to identify correlations between chemical and physical parameters. We analyzed Atacama Compact Array and Total Power 1.3 mm (Band 6) data, deriving column densities, line widths, and excitation temperatures of multiple molecular species by modeling detected lines under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) using MADCUBA. Spectra show 35 species, from simple molecules (e.g., CO, SO, SiO) to complex organic molecules (COMs), with seven sources exhibiting high chemical complexity (> 100 transitions). Average excitation temperatures vary across the sample: $T_\\text{ex}>100~\\text{K}$ for eight sources, $50-100~\\text{K}$ for four, and $T_\\text{ex} < 50~\\text{K}$ for the remainder. Sources with $T_\\text{ex} 100~\\text{K}$ indicate the presence of typical hot cores where thermal desorption is efficient, resulting in line-rich spectra. Comparing these chemical properties with the bolometric luminosity to envelope mass ratio ($L_\\text{bol}/M_\\text{env}$), an evolutionary tracer, we find tentative correlations with line widths, excitation temperature, and column densities.

Spatially resolved analysis of the pure rotational H$_2$ lines (S(1)-S(7)) reveals a characteristic power-law temperature distribution in different apertures, with the two prominent southern star-forming regions exhibiting unexpectedly high molecular gas temperatures, comparable to those in the AGN powered nuclear region. We investigate potential heating mechanisms including direct AGN photoionisation, UV fluorescent excitation from young star clusters, and shock excitation. We find that shock heating gives the most plausible explanation, consistent with multiple near- and mid-IR tracers and diagnostics. Using photoionisation models from the PhotoDissociation Region Toolbox, we quantify the ISM conditions in the different regions, determining that the southern star-forming regions have a high density ($n_H \\sim 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) and are irradiated by a moderate UV radiation field ($G_0 \\sim 10^{3}$ Habing). Fitting a suite of Paris-Durham shock models to the rotational H$_2$ lines, as well as rovibrational 1-0 S(1), 1-0 S(2), and 2-1 S(1) H$_2$ emission lines, we find that a slow ($v_s \\sim 10$ km/s) C-type shock is likely responsible for the elevated temperatures. Our analysis loosely favours local starburst activity as the driver of the shocks and circumnuclear gas dynamics in NGC 7582, though the possibility of an AGN jet contribution cannot be excluded.",

Any spectral region showing transmission must be highly ionized, while dark regions could be ionized or neutral, thus the dark pixel fraction provides a (nearly) model independent upper limit to the volume-filling fraction of the neutral intergalactic medium, modulo choices in binning scale and dark pixel definition. Here we provide updated measurements of the 3.3 comoving Mpc dark pixel fraction at $z=4.85-6.25$ in the Ly$\\alpha$, Ly$\\beta$, and Ly$\\gamma$ forests of 34 deep $5.8\\lesssim z\\lesssim 6.6$ quasar spectra from the (enlarged) XQR-30 sample.

        "abstract": "The equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) have become the standard mathematical framework for modeling high-energy plasmas in curved spacetimes. However, the fragility of the primitive variable reconstruction operation in GRMHD, as well as the difficulties in maintaining strong hyperbolicity of the equations, sharply limit the applicability of the GRMHD model in scenarios involving large Lorentz factors and high magnetizations, such as around neutron stars. Non-ideal effects, such as electron inertia and Hall terms, are also neglected, and the absence of an explicitly evolved electric field precludes the self-consistent modeling of the strong poloidal fields found around spinning black holes, which are known to be crucial for jet formation. Here, we present a general relativistic multifluid model which strictly generalizes the GRMHD equations, consisting of an arbitrary number of relativistic fluid species interacting with a shared electromagnetic field via an explicit coupling of their source terms, thus allowing for the incorporation of non-ideal effects. We sketch how our model may be derived from general relativistic kinetics (via moments of the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation), as well as how GRMHD may be recovered in the single-fluid limit as the mobility of charge carriers goes to infinity. We present a numerical scheme for solving the general relativistic multifluid equations, and validate it against the analogous scheme for the GRMHD equations. Since the primitive variable reconstruction operation for our multifluid model is purely hydrodynamic, and therefore independent of the magnetic field, the resulting solver is highly robust, and able to simulate significantly larger Lorentz factors and higher magnetizations (across both black hole and neutron star spacetimes) than GRMHD without loss of either accuracy or stability.",

Current morphological studies have been limited by small samples, as well as by insufficient imaging depth, which may not allow reliable separation between point-like and extended components, leaving the existence and properties of extended components in LRD largely unconstrained. Here, we perform the image stacking analysis of 217 LRDs in four NIRCam bands, representing the largest and homogeneous sample observed from COSMOS-Web survey to date. Our results reveal an unambiguous detection of faint extended emission in the F444W band, with a typical size of ~200 parsecs and magnitude of ~27.7 AB at z~6.5. We perform four-band photometric SED fitting based on galaxy templates and derive a stellar mass of 8.91+-~0.1 logM_sun. Given this stellar mass, the host galaxy is compact, i.e., ~2.5 times smaller than star-forming populations at similar mass, and the typical black hole mass of LRDs is elevated by ~1.5 dex above the local MBH-M* relation.

One standard mechanism for constraining decaying dark matter from 21-cm observations relies on heating of the intergalactic medium by the decay products, an effect whose observability is entangled with the uncertain Lyman-$\\alpha$ fluxes and X-ray heating from the first stars. In this Letter, we explore a novel mechanism, where the Lyman-$\\alpha$ photons produced from dark matter decay initiate early Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the spin temperature to the gas temperature, thereby boosting the 21-cm signal. This mechanism provides constraints on dark matter that are less dependent on uncertainties associated with star formation than constraints on exotic heating. We study this effect for decaying dark matter with masses $m_{\\chi}\\sim20.4-27.2$ eV, where diphoton decay efficiently produces Lyman-series photons. We present forecasts for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and the Square Kilometre Array, showing their potential to probe an unconstrained parameter space for light decaying DM, including axion-like particles.",

Using simulated, masked CMB temperature maps, we validate our pipeline by reconstructing both maps and angular power spectra, and we perform cosmological parameter inference with competitive precision. In comparison with the standard pseudo-$C_\\ell$ approach, Flinch delivers substantially tighter constraints, with error bars reduced by up to 40%.

Here, we present data from the first two seasons targeting the Shapley Supercluster (0.02<0.06), which is responsible for a large but unknown fraction of our local group's motion. Until now, no supernovae had been analyzed in the direction of Shapley. Through the WHALES survey, we have identified 12 likely SNe Ia in this region using SkyMapper, including 8 with spectroscopic confirmation. We present the first light curves of these SNe and combine our observations with data from ATLAS. We demonstrate that the low number of discovered SNe Ia per season is consistent with various rate calculations, highlighting the need for future surveys to monitor superclusters over a multi-year timespan. Finally, we present simulations of SN Ia observations in the environments of massive galaxy clusters, demonstrating how the inferred peculiar velocities can constrain cluster masses, and highlighting the added complexity within superclusters. We find that a sample of 100 SNe Ia would enable a 25% precision measurement of the total mass of the Shapley Supercluster.",

Such couplings modify solutions of general relativity (GR) and therefore can be probed in various astrophysical systems. A particularly interesting scenario arises if dark matter experiences non-minimal couplings, as dark matter densities are expected to spike in the vicinity of binary black hole mergers. This gives a novel setting for simultaneously studying dark matter and (beyond) GR physics via observations of gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we explore effects of various non-minimal couplings on GWs by working with a model-independent parameterization for left- and right-handed GW strains. We extend the parameterization proposed in \\cite{Jenks:2023pmk,Daniel:2024lev} to include early-universe effects, and we write down the generic solution assuming slowly-varying matter fields.

Our analysis incorporates both Gaussian, stationary, and unpolarized point sources from diverse sky locations as well as a random sky map. We have performed full-sky map reconstruction in pixel space using maximum likelihood estimation to extract the angular distribution of the SGWB. The results demonstrate that, when considering the detector noise, the TianQin+LISA+Taiji detector network can reconstruct the angular power spectrum of the stochastic background up to a maximum multipole moment of $l = 14 $, which can provide valuable information for studies on the spatial distribution of galactic compact binaries and physical imprints from the early Universe.",

        "abstract": "Magnetically arrested disks (MADs) are a compelling model for explaining variability in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), including horizon-scale outbursts like those observed in Sagittarius A*. MADs experience powerful flux eruptions-episodic ejections of magnetic flux from the black hole horizon-that may drive the observed luminosity variations. In this work, we develop and validate a new formalism describing large-scale magnetic field transport in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of MADs with geometrical thicknesses of $h/R=0.1$ and $h/R=0.3$. We introduce a net flux transport velocity, $v_\\Phi$, which accounts for both advective and diffusive processes. We show that MADs maintain a statistical quasi-steady state where advection and diffusion nearly balance. Flux eruptions appear as small deviations from this equilibrium, with $v_\\Phi/V_k\\ll1$, where $V_k$ is the local Keplerian velocity. Using this framework, we analytically derive a recurrence timescale for flux eruptions, $t_{\\rm rec}\\sim1500\\, r_g/c$. This timescale closely matches simulation results. The smallness of $v_\\Phi$ explains the long recurrence times of flux eruptions compared to other system timescales. We also take a closer look at the diffusion of the magnetic field by performing the first measurement of turbulent resistivity in MADs. We then estimate the turbulent magnetic Prandtl number, defined as the ratio of turbulent viscosity to turbulent resistivity. We find $\\mathcal{P}_m\\sim3$, consistent with shearing-box simulations of magneto rotational instability-driven turbulence. While flux eruptions excite large-scale non-axisymmetric modes and locally enhance turbulent resistivity, magnetic field diffusion is dominated by smaller-scale turbulent motions. These results provide new insight into the nature of AGN variability and the fundamental physics of magnetic field transport.",

This unprecedented composition, combined with substantial absolute CO levels (CO/H2O = 1.65+-0.09) and red spectral slopes, provides direct evidence for galactic cosmic ray (GCR) processing of the outer layers of the interstellar comet nucleus. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that GCR irradiation efficiently converts CO to CO2 while synthesizing organic-rich crusts, suggesting that the outer layers of 3I/ATLAS consist of irradiated material which properties are consistent with the observed composition of 3I/ATLAS coma and with its observed spectral reddening. Estimates of the erosion rate of 3I/ATLAS indicate that current outgassing samples the GCR-processed zone only (depth ~15-20 m), never reaching pristine interior material. Outgassing of pristine material after perihelion remains possible, though it is considered unlikely. This represents a paradigm shift: long-residence interstellar objects primarily reveal GCR-processed material rather than pristine material representative of their primordial formation environments. With 3I/ATLAS approaching perihelion in October 2025, immediate follow-up observations are critical to confirm this interpretation and establish GCR processing as a fundamental evolutionary pathway for interstellar objects.",

In this work, we propose a novel extension to astrometry.net that incorporates stellar spectral type, which is derived from hyperspectral imagery, into the matching process. By adding this spectral dimension to each star detection, we constrain the search space and improve match specificity, enabling successful astrometric solutions with significantly fewer stars. Our modified pipeline demonstrates improved fit rates and reduced failure cases in cluttered or ambiguous star fields, which is especially critical for autonomous space situational awareness and traffic management. Our results suggest that modest spectral resolution, when incorporated into existing geometric frameworks, can dramatically improve robustness and efficiency in onboard star identification systems.",

        "abstract": "We present AT2022kak, a rapidly evolving optical transient discovered by the KiloNova and Transients Program (KNTraP). This interesting burst exhibited extremely fast evolution, with a large amplitude blue outburst of m > 3.3 in a single night, and a rapid fade back to quiescence in the following two nights. We deployed a multi-wavelength follow-up campaign, monitoring the object for the next two months, but saw no recurrent burst. Three years later, while observing to get spectroscopy of the object in quiescence, there was a new outburst, enabling the collection of time-resolved spectra of the rise and fade of the outburst. The light curve properties of the first burst and spectra of the second burst are consistent with a dwarf nova. Its fast evolving behaviour makes it one of the fastest and faintest dwarf novae observed. The estimated distance of AT2022kak from the Galactic centre is ~6.6 kpc, with a scale height of ~2 kpc. This scale height places it in the Galactic thick disk, where only very few dwarf novae have been found, and is therefore a potential Population II dwarf novae system.",

HYDRA spectra, Gaia astrometry, and isochrone fitting constrain the absolute reddening, apparent modulus, and age to E(B-V) = 0.30 +/- 0.02, (m-M)=12.51 +/- 0.06, and 1.46 +/- 0.02 Gyr for [Fe/H] between -0.2 and solar; the spectroscopic [Fe/H] = -0.13 +/- 0.068 (MAD) from 156 single-star members. Corrections for variable reddening reduce the scatter in the unevolved main sequence below the turnoff. A(Li) is derived for only single star members from the G-dwarf Li-Plateau to the tip of the red giant branch. Giants separate into two distinct groups, probable first-ascent giants with detectable Li that declines with evolution toward the red giant tip and stars within the clump and the asymptotic giant branch which only exhibit upper limits. A(Li) structure from the turnoff to the unevolved main sequence, including the Li-Dip, and the presence of an extended color spread among the upper main sequence stars are attributed to the V_ROT distribution, indicating the wall of the Li-Dip as the true hot boundary of the Kraft break. Differences in the color-magnitude diagram topology of NGC 7789 and NGC 752 are explored and attributed to differences in the individual cluster V_ROT distributions. Prior indications that main sequence stars more massive than the Li-Dip evolve redward across the Li-Wall, undergoing rotational spindown and Li depletion like stars within the Li-Dip, are confirmed.",

Two observations, targeting the cluster X-ray core and the prototypical cold front, were performed with exposures of 105 ks and 276 ks, respectively. We find that the gas in the core is blueshifted by $v_z\\sim-200$ km s$^{-1}$ relative to the brightest cluster galaxy, while the low-entropy gas inside the cold front is redshifted by $v_z\\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$. As one moves further off-center across the front, the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity changes significantly, by $\\Delta v_z=535^{+167}_{-154}$ km s$^{-1}$, back to the value similar to that in the core. There are no significant LoS velocity gradients perpendicular to the cluster symmetry axis. These features suggest that the gas forming the cold front is flowing in the plane oriented along the LoS, supporting an offset merger scenario in which the main cluster has passed in front of the subcluster and induced rotation of the core gas in the plane perpendicular to the sky. The region just inside the front exhibits the largest LoS velocity dispersion seen across two pointings, $\\sigma_z\\sim420$ km s$^{-1}$, which can be interpreted as a developing turbulence or a projection of the LoS velocity shear within the front. The large LoS velocity jump across the cold front, combined with the lack of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the surface of the front, suggests some mechanism to suppress it. For example, a magnetic field with $B>5\\,\\mu$G is required if the cold front is stabilized by magnetic draping.",

        "abstract": "Recent reconstructions of the large-scale cosmological velocity field with kinetic Sunyaev Zeldovich (kSZ) tomography have returned an amplitude that is low with respect to the halo model prediction, captured by the kSZ velocity reconstruction bias $b_v <1$. This suggests that common choices for modeling the galaxy-electron cross correlation have systematically overestimated the true power, at least over scales and redshifts used in the velocity reconstruction measurements. In this paper, we study the implications of this overestimation for constraints on local-type primordial non-Gaussianity in current and near-future cosmological surveys. For concreteness, we focus on kSZ velocity reconstruction from a Vera Rubin Observatory-like survey in tandem with contemporary cosmic microwave background measurements. Assuming standard choices for the fiducial model of the small-scale galaxy-electron cross correlation, we find that upcoming kSZ tomography measurements can significantly improve constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity via measurement of scale-dependent galaxy bias, in broad concordance with previous studies of the application of kSZ tomography to primordial non-Gaussianity. However, when we instead modify the assumed galaxy-electron cross-spectrum to be consistent with recent measurements of the velocity reconstruction bias, this picture can change appreciably. Specifically, we find that if the inferred suppression of galaxy-electron power persists at higher redshifts $z\\gtrsim 1$, kSZ-driven improvement in local primordial non-Gaussianity constraints may be less significant than previously estimated. We explore how these conclusions depend on various modeling and experimental assumptions and discuss implications for the emerging program of kSZ velocity reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "The observation of the redshifted 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen is a promising probe for understanding the phase transition of the early universe and its evolution during the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). One of the primary obstacles to the statistical detection of the target signal is the presence of residual foreground, which arises from gain calibration errors. Previous studies have shown that gain calibration errors as small as 0.01% can lead to a biased interpretation of the observed signal power spectrum estimation, by nearly an order of magnitude. A recent study further highlights that to retrieve astrophysical parameters accurately, the threshold gain calibration error should be lower than 0.01%. In this work, we develop a post-calibration mitigation strategy that combines foreground subtraction techniques with foreground avoidance to address residual contamination arising from gain calibration errors. We use an end-to-end pipeline 21cmE2E to simulate a realistic sky model and telescope configuration within the 138-146 MHz frequency range. To assess the impact of residual antenna-based gain calibration errors, we perform a detailed power spectrum analysis across several threshold levels. Our analysis shows that the extraction of the target signal over the wavenumber range $0.05 \\leq k \\leq 0.5$ Mpc$^{-1}$ is possible with a threshold gain calibration error of 1%, although with a significant SNR tradeoff on larger scales. Moreover, this work also offers a comparative assessment of foreground removal and avoidance techniques in the context of future SKA1-Low AA* observations.",

In this paper, we calculate one-dimensional thermal profiles of the third interstellar object 3I/ATLAS throughout its trajectory in an attempt to gain insight into its bulk properties based on measurements of its volatiles. Assuming a variety of typical comet and asteroid bulk geophysical properties such as heat capacities, densities, and conductivities, we calculate the radial thermal profile as a function of depth throughout the hyperbolic trajectory. The methods and code to generate the thermal profile are flexible for any hyperbolic or bound orbit. The thermal profiles are benchmarked to the nominal sublimation temperatures of H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO, but are still applicable to any volatile. Comparison between the modeled surface temperatures and the observed onset of H$_2$O activity near 3 au indicates that surface temperatures exceeding $\\sim$150 K can only be achieved if the albedo is below 0.2. We therefore set the upper limit on the albedo of 3I/ATLAS to be 0.2.",

        "abstract": "Stellar-mass compact objects (COs) embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs are commonly assumed to accrete via Bondi or Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) prescriptions, neglecting gas angular momentum. We show that differential rotation in AGN discs can impart non-negligible angular momentum, in which case accretion proceeds through a viscous disc rather than Bondi/BHL flow. Our model provides a new framework estimating the CO accretion rate as $\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{CO} = \\min\\{\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{vis}, \\dot{M}_\\mathrm{BHL}\\}$, where the viscous rate $\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{vis}$ accounts for gas--CO relative motion decomposed into a local gradient term (due to differential rotation) and bulk motion (from differing orbital parameters). This rate can be expressed as $\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{vis} = \\alpha \\xi (r_\\mathrm{H}/r_\\mathrm{BHL})^3\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{BHL}$, where $\\xi$ is a coefficient of order unity. It can also be approximately scaled to the global AGN accretion rate as $\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{vis} \\propto \\dot{M}_1$, with the scaling coefficients in both forms determined by the specific dynamical configuration. The accretion is viscosity-limited when $q > [\\alpha \\xi(1+\\mathcal{M}^2)^{3}/3]^{1/2} h^3$, where $q$ is the mass ratio between the CO and the supermassive black hole, $\\alpha$ the viscosity parameter, $\\mathcal{M}$ the Mach number of the bulk relative motion, and $h$ the aspect ratio of the AGN disc. In thin AGN discs this condition is satisfied for most stellar-mass or more massive COs. Our framework also naturally allows for the inclusion of established outflow corrections, thereby enabling a more realistic treatment of super-Eddington flows. Our formulation thus improves upon Bondi/BHL prescriptions and offers a more physically motivated basis for studying CO evolution in AGN environments.",

This is achieved by relaxing the perfect fluid assumption in the standard model and considering a general viscous cosmic fluid (vCF) with non-zero particle creation rate and evolving adiabatic equation of state. Transition points of the Universe and the finite boundary connecting them is exactly determined. We then propose a novel method to determine the early-time viscous coefficient and inflation energy scale using the Cosmic Mode Index value postulated by Padmanabhan. Considering the data from the Planck 2018 analysis, this yields an inflationary Hubble parameter of $H_{I}\\approx10^{13}$\\,GeV. An equivalent scalar-field description for the inflationary epoch is then constructed and inferences are made regarding the nature of inflation. Notably, we find that the model describes an ultra-slow-roll hilltop inflation scenario with a graceful exit to radiation-dominated epoch. Subsequently, we show that bulk viscosity in this model can be expressed as Israel-Stewart equation in relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics with an appropriate underlying viscous coefficient and relaxation time that satisfy the causality constraint in its extreme limit. Finally, by comparing the evolution of this causal relation and its Navier-Stokes counterpart, we infer that the evolution from inflation to radiation era signifies a fluid transitioning from viscoelastic to pseudoplastic behavior.",

Because it is chemically inert, it has never been considered in astrochemical models that studied molecular evolution. In the cold dark environments of pre-stellar cores, where the temperatures are below 10 K, Ne can condense onto the surface of interstellar grains. We investigated the effect of Ne on the production of formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH) through carbon monoxide (CO) hydrogenation on different cold surfaces. We highlight its role in conditions corresponding to pre-stellar cores. In an ultra-high vacuum system, we conducted two types of experiments. The first experiment involved the co-deposition of CO and H atoms with or without Ne. The second experiment involved depositing a monolayer of CO and separately a monolayer of Ne (or vice versa), followed by bombarding the layers with hydrogen atoms. Additionally, we used a gas-grain chemical code to simulate a pre-stellar core and determine where Ne can affect the chemistry. The presence of Ne on the surface significantly inhibits CO hydrogenation at temperatures below 12 K. In the co-deposition experiments, we observed a 38% decrease in the H$_2$CO production at 11 K when the quantity of Ne in the mixture was lower than a monolayer. At 10 K and with one monolayer in the mixture, the production decreased to 77%, and it reached 91% for a few monolayers of Ne in the mixture at 9 K. While the decrease in CH$_3$OH formation is still notable, it is less pronounced: 43% at 11 K, 61% at 10 K, and 77% at 9 K. Experiments with stacked layers revealed that the CO layer decay varies slightly when the Ne layer is positioned above or below it. This observation indicates that Ne and CO create a mixture in which Ne can diffuse and stabilize at the surface, which isolates CO molecules from the accreting H atoms.",

        "abstract": "The dipper subclass of YSOs are characterised by frequent dips in their light curves. Irregular dippers do not show periodic signatures and have dips accounting for significant proportions of their photospheric flux. Given the short timescales on which these dips occur, their driving mechanisms are linked to the inner circumstellar disc dynamics. We present the first multi-epoch analysis of 16 irregular dippers observed with X-Shooter. Investigating the properties of their dips, and in particular the analysis of the dust characteristics, we aim to understand the root of their variability, and get a glimpse of the inner disc behaviour. We employed a novel approach to measure the properties of the dips, by combining class III templates with Gaia photometry to construct the intrinsic photospheres. We measured several dip properties including the depth of the dips, near-infrared (NIR) excesses, and their optical depths as a function of wavelength. We record 20 significant dips that range in their dip properties and show no relation to one another. In almost all cases, the low optical depths and small NIR excesses are observed. Comparison of their optical depths with grain opacity models show that the dips can be explained by the presence of dust substructures containing processed grains obscuring their photospheres and/or their discs. These grain distributions can have maximum sizes as large as 20$\\mu m$ and in many cases have almost grey-like extinction, while some require a strong scattering component. The findings highlight the extent of the irregularity of dippers, but also link it to the dust dynamics in the inner regions of circumstellar discs. The dust substructures causing the variability require processed dust grains to be lifted above the disc into the line of sight. Possible lifting mechanisms including disc winds, unstable accretion columns, and disc warps are discussed.",

        "title": "Evidence of cosmic-ray acceleration up to sub-PeV energies in the supernova remnant IC 443",
        "abstract": "Supernova remnants (SNRs) have been considered as the primary contributors to cosmic rays (CRs) in our Galaxy. However, the maximum energy of particles that can be accelerated by shocks of SNRs is uncertain observationally and theoretically, and the role of contribution to CRs around PeV energies by SNRs is unclear. In this study, we present observations of high-energy $\\gamma$-ray emission from the SNR IC 443 using the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). The morphological analysis reveals a pointlike source whose location and spectrum are consistent with those of the Fermi-LAT-detected compact source with $\\pi^0$-decay signature, and a more extended source which is consistent with a newly discovered source, previously unrecognized by Fermi-LAT. The spectrum of the point source can be described by a power-law function with an index of $\\sim3.0$, extending beyond $\\sim 30$ TeV without apparent cutoff. Assuming a hadronic origin of the $\\gamma$-ray emission, the $95\\%$ lower limit of accelerated protons reaches about 300 TeV. The extended source might be coincident with IC 443, SNR G189.6+3.3 or the putative pulsar wind nebula CXOU J061705.3+222127, and can be explained by either a hadronic or leptonic model.

We compute the tidal deformability and the $f$-mode oscillation frequency of anisotropic neutron stars using a phenomenological quasi-local model characterized by a single dimensionless anisotropy parameter. We find that while the relation between the tidal deformability and the $f$-mode frequency depends on the degree of anisotropy, it remains largely insensitive to variations in the equation of state (the relation between radial pressure and energy density) for a fixed anisotropy parameter, similar to the isotropic case. Leveraging this anisotropy-dependent universal relation within a statistical framework, we place constraints on the anisotropy parameter using both the gravitational wave observation of GW170817 and simulated data for a GW170817-like event observed by a future network of detectors. We find that the anisotropy parameter can be constrained to order unity with current data, and the bounds remain comparable with future detector sensitivities. Importantly, these constraints are only weakly affected by uncertainties in the neutron-star equation of state.",

We show that at these stages, the full spectral energy distribution - X-ray spectra and UV/optical photometry - is well described by a compact, yet standard accretion disk, the same disk which powers the X-rays at all times. By fitting up to three three epochs per source with a fully relativistic disk model, we show that many system properties can be reliably recovered, including importantly the black hole mass ($M_{\\bullet}$). These accretion-based $M_{\\bullet}$ values, which in this sample span nearly three orders of magnitude, are consistent with galactic scaling relations but are significantly more precise (68\\% credible interval $ < \\pm 0.3$ dex) and physically motivated. Expected accretion scaling relations (e.g., $L_{Bol}^{ disk} / L_{Edd} \\propto T_p^4 \\propto M_{\\bullet}^{-1}$), TDE-specific physics correlations ($L_{plat} \\propto M_{\\bullet}^{2/3}$ and $R_{out}/r_g \\propto M_{\\bullet}^{-2/3}$) and black hole-host galaxy correlations ($M_{\\bullet}$-$M_{\\star}$ and $M_{\\bullet}$-$\\sigma_{\\star}$) naturally emerge from the data and, for the first time, are self-consistently extended into the intermediate-mass (IMBH, $M_{\\bullet} < 10^{5}$) regime. We discuss the implications of these results for TDE physics and modeling.

        "abstract": "In a tidal disruption event (TDE), a star is disrupted by the tidal field of a massive black hole, creating a debris stream that returns to the black hole, forms an accretion flow, and powers a luminous flare. Over the last few decades, several numerical studies have concluded that shock-induced dissipation occurs as the stream returns to pericentre (i.e., pre-self-intersection), resulting in efficient circularisation of the debris. However, the efficacy of these shocks is the subject of intense debate. We present high-resolution simulations (up to 10^10 particles) of the disruption of a solar-like star by a 10^6M_sun black hole with the new, GPU-based, smoothed-particle hydrodynamics code SPH-EXA, including the relativistic apsidal precession of the stellar debris orbits; our simulations run from initial disruption to the moment of stream self-intersection. With 10^8 particles - corresponding to the highest-resolution SPH simulations of TDEs in the pre-existing literature - we find significant, in-plane spreading of the debris as the stream returns through pericenter, in line with previous works that suggested this is a significant source of dissipation and luminous emission. However, with increasing resolution this effect is dramatically diminished, and with 10^10 particles there is effectively no change between the incoming and the outgoing stream widths. Our results demonstrate that the paradigm of significant dissipation of kinetic energy during pericentre passage is incorrect, and instead it is likely that debris circularisation is mediated by the originally proposed, stream-stream collision scenario.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of hot Jupiters has challenged the classical planet formation theory. Although various formation mechanisms have been proposed, the dominant channel and relative contributions remain unclear. Furthermore, hot Jupiters offer a unique opportunity to test tidal theory and measure the fundamental tidal quality factor, which is yet to be well-constrained. In this work, based on a hot Jupiter sample around single Sun-like stars with kinematic properties, {we find that the declining trend of their frequency is broken with a ridge at about 2 Gyr, providing direct evidence that hot Jupiters are formed with multiple origins of different timescales. By fitting with the theoretical expectations, we provide a constraint of tidal factor for Sun-like stars, which aligns well with the detected number of hot Jupiters with orbital decay. Moreover, we simultaneously constrain the relative importance of different channels: although the majority of hot Jupiters are formed early, within several tenths of Gyr via 'Early' models (e.g., in-situ formation, disk migration, planet-planet scattering and Kozai-Lidov interaction), a significant portion (about 40%) should be formed late on a relatively long timescale extending up to several Gyr mainly via the secular chaos mechanism, further supported by the obliquity distribution of 'late-arrived' hot Jupiters. Our findings provide a unified framework that reconciles hot Jupiter demographics and long-term evolution with multichannel formation.",

        "abstract": "Recent observations of the Fornax cluster show depolarization signatures on megaparsec scales, which may be associated with shocks and/or sloshing motions during cluster merger and/or in-fall. To investigate the possible reasons behind the depolarization, we carry out analytical and full polarized radiative transfer (PRT) calculations of radio point sources behind a merging galaxy cluster simulated using the FLASH code. With uniform background light, we analyzed the rotation measure (RM) morphology near the shock front and the cluster center, where sloshing cold fronts appear. For the shock scenario, we find a local RM enhancement by $\\sim56\\%$ behind the shock front on megaparsec scales, arising from the compression of hot gas and magnetic field lines. Behind the sloshing cold front, the cluster center shows decrement in RM magnitude by $\\sim23.3\\%$, as a result of the cancellation effect of randomly-oriented magnetic fields induced by sloshing-driven turbulence. We find that beam depolarization increases behind shock fronts and across sloshing cold fronts, indicating enhanced magnetic field fluctuations across the plane of the sky in both scenarios. By fully accounting for all radiative transfer coefficients in the PRT calculations, the uniform background light becomes more depolarized near the cluster center, with the effect growing more pronounced as background intensity decreases. This suggests that synchrotron emission and Faraday rotation of the intracluster medium can significantly influence the polarization of background sources.",

Using a statistically significant sample of Milky Way- and Andromeda-like (MW/M31) analogs from the high-resolution TNG50 cosmological simulation, we carry out the first systematic investigation of spiral-arm formation, their observable properties, and the underlying physical drivers. The selected analogs predominantly exhibit two-armed ($m = 2$) spirals in both stars and gas, while the gaseous disks often display stronger, more tightly wound, and multi-armed patterns ($m>2$). Spiral features appear across stellar populations of different ages, confirming their density-wave nature and producing coherent spirals in both metallicity and mean stellar age distributions-consistent with recent Gaia observations of the Milky Way. Our analysis reveals a diverse dynamical scenario for spiral generation: gas content, disk coldness, and shear jointly regulate the growth and morphology of spiral perturbations. We find that the gas content and the dynamical coldness of the disk jointly regulate spiral growth: galaxies with higher gas fractions and colder disks develop more prominent spirals. The measured relation between spiral pitch angle and disk shear shows significant scatter around the analytic prediction, likely due to the combined influence of bars, gas inflows, and feedback. These results demonstrate that spiral density waves can persist in fully cosmological disks, linking internal dynamical processes to galaxy assembly and offering testable predictions for present and future surveys such as JWST and Roman.",

The low-frequency data, particularly in band 3, is highly sensitive to propagation effects such as dispersion measure (DM) fluctuations, which can be imprints of some astrophysical phenomena (scientific outliers). Here, we analyze the two outliers of possible astrophysical origin coming from the band 3 DM time series of two pulsars: PSR J1022+1001, with an ecliptic latitude of -0.06 degree , and PSR J2145-0750, one of the brightest MSPs, with multi-component profile morphology. Our study reveals compelling evidence for a coronal mass ejection (CME) event traced in the data of PSR J1022+1001, and reports evidence for a potential mode-changing event in PSR J2145-0750. Extending the analyses presented here to the full sample of InPTA-DR2 pulsars is expected to reveal additional CME events, and possible mode-changing events. Such detections will not only improve our understanding of solar and pulsar magnetospheric plasma interactions but will also enable more accurate modelling of DM variations, leading to improved pulsar timing solutions, which are crucial for high-precision Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) science.",

The quality and completeness of light curves have a direct impact on variability studies, particularly for faint AGNs and high-redshift AGNs. To improve the quality of long-term light curves for AGNs, we bin and stack multi-epoch images balancing the image depths and temporal resolution. As a case study, we apply this method to Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) field, where the overlapping region covers an area of about 370 arcmin$^2$ and includes $g$-band and $r$-band data taken from March 2018 to December 2024. The co-added images are approximately 2.0 to 2.5 magnitudes deeper than the ZTF single-epoch images. With co-added images, we construct light curves for 73 AGNs in the EGS field. Compared to the traditional ZTF light curves, our light curves maintain consistent long-term variability trends but with higher photometric precision. Furthermore, this method can help detect AGNs with weak variability which are missed from the traditional ZTF data due to the noisy light curves or below the detection limit in ZTF's single-epoch exposure. Among the 73 AGNs, the majority exhibit a bluer-when-brighter (BWB) trend on long-term timescales, which is consistent with previous studies. This work offers insights for optimizing AGN light curves in both current and upcoming all-sky time-domain surveys.",

We determine how the fraction of radio loud sources changes across this parameter space, finding that jets are most efficiently produced in quasars with either a very massive central black hole ($M_{\\textrm{BH}} > 10^9 \\textrm{M}_{\\odot}$) or one that is rapidly accreting ($\\lambda_{\\textrm{Edd}}>0.3$). We also show that there are differences in the blueshift of the CIV $\\lambda$1549{\\AA} line and the equivalent width of the HeII $\\lambda$1640{\\AA} line in radio loud and radio quiet quasars that persist even after accounting for differences in the mass and accretion rate of the central black hole. Generally, we find an anti-correlation between the inferred presence of disc winds and jets, which we suggest is mediated by differences in the quasars' spectral energy distributions. The latter result is shown through the close coupling between tracers of wind kinematics and the ionising flux-- which holds for both radio loud and radio quiet sources, despite differences between their emission line properties-- and is hinted at by a different Baldwin effect in the two populations.",

        "abstract": "We present a detailed single-pulse study of the long-period pulsar PSR J2129+4119 using high-sensitivity FAST observations. Despite locating well below the traditional death line, the pulsar exhibits sustained and multi-modal emission behavior, including nulls, weak pulses, regular emission, and occasional bright pulses. The nulling fraction is measured to be $8.13\\% \\pm 0.51\\%$, with null durations typically under four pulse periods. Fluctuation spectral analysis reveals both phase-modulated subpulse drifting and intermittent beat-like modulation. At the same time, polarization profiles show high linear polarization and stable polarization position angle (PPA) swings consistent with a near-tangential sightline geometry. Quasi-periodic microstructures are detected in 11.54\\% of regular pulses, with a mean periodicity and width of 4.57 ms and 4.30 ms, respectively. A well-defined scintillation arc in the secondary spectrum confirms the presence of a localized scattering screen. These results indicate that PSR J2129+4119 remains magnetospherically active and coherently emitting despite its low energy loss rate, offering key insights into pulsar emission physics near the death line.",

        "abstract": "Traditional seesaw mechanisms provide an elegant theoretical framework for explaining the small yet non-zero masses of neutrinos. Nevertheless, they face significant experimental challenges, primarily because the energy scale associated with the seesaw mechanism is too high to be directly probed in terrestrial experiments. In this paper, we explore the gravitational waves (GWs) generated via graviton bremsstrahlung during the decay of seesaw particles in the early Universe. Specifically, we compute the GW spectrum resulting from the decay of the Higgs triplet within the type-II seesaw model. Our results demonstrate that the resulting GW spectrum depends sensitively on the mass of the Higgs triplet and its couplings to the Standard Model Higgs doublet and the left-handed lepton doublet. The detection of such a high-frequency GW background could offer a unique experimental window into the seesaw mechanism and provide indirect evidence for its validity.",

        "abstract": "Pulsar surveys generate millions of candidates per run, overwhelming manual inspection. This thesis builds a deep learning pipeline for radio pulsar candidate selection that fuses array-derived features with image diagnostics. From approximately 500 GB of Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) data, raw voltages are converted to filterbanks (SIGPROC), then de-dispersed and folded across trial dispersion measures (PRESTO) to produce approximately 32,000 candidates. Each candidate yields four diagnostics--summed profile, time vs. phase, subbands vs. phase, and DM curve--represented as arrays and images. A baseline stacked model (ANNs for arrays + CNNs for images with logistic-regression fusion) reaches 68% accuracy. We then refine the CNN architecture and training (regularization, learning-rate scheduling, max-norm constraints) and mitigate class imbalance via targeted augmentation, including a GAN-based generator for the minority class. The enhanced CNN attains 87% accuracy; the final GAN+CNN system achieves 94% accuracy with balanced precision and recall on a held-out test set, while remaining lightweight enough for near--real-time triage. The results show that combining array and image channels improves separability over image-only approaches, and that modest generative augmentation substantially boosts minority (pulsar) recall. The methods are survey-agnostic and extensible to forthcoming high-throughput facilities.",

To establish this connection, we derive constraints on the PBH abundance parameter $\\beta$ as a function of the initial PBH mass $M_{\\mathrm{BH_0}}$ and DM mass $m_{\\mathrm{DM}}$, by considering the bound from the observed relic DM abundance. Using these constraints, we compute the resulting neutrino flux and show that DM masses in the PeV-EeV range can yield neutrinos of comparable energies, capable of accounting for both the KM3-230213A and IceCube events while remaining consistent with the relic abundance constraint. Interestingly, the scenario remains viable over a broad region of parameter space while satisfying existing cosmological and astrophysical bounds. Overall, our results demonstrate that PBH evaporation followed by DM decay provides a consistent and natural explanation for the observed ultra-high-energy neutrino events in the absence of accompanying multimessenger signatures.",

        "abstract": "Stars on bound orbits around a supermassive black hole may undergo repeated partial tidal disruption events (rpTDEs), producing periodic flares. While several candidates have been suggested, definitive confirmation of these events remains elusive. We report the discovery of AT2023uqm, a nuclear transient that has exhibited at least five periodic optical flares, making it only the second confirmed case of periodicity after ASASSN-14ko. Uniquely, the flares from AT2023uqm show a nearly exponential increase in energy--a \"runaway\" phenomenon signaling the star's progressive destruction. This behavior is consistent with rpTDEs of low-mass, main-sequence stars or evolved giant stars. Multiwavelength observations and spectroscopic analysis of the two most recent flares reinforce its interpretation as an rpTDE. Intriguingly, each flare displays a similar double-peaked structure, potentially originating from a double-peaked mass fallback rate or two discrete collisions per orbit. The extreme ratio of peak separation to orbital period draws attention to the possibility of a giant star being disrupted, which could be distinguished from a low-mass main-sequence star by its future mass-loss evolution. Our analysis demonstrates the power of rpTDEs to probe the properties of disrupted stars and the physical processes of tidal disruption, though it is currently limited by our knowledge of these events. AT2023uqm emerges as the most compelling rpTDE thus far, serving as a crucial framework for modeling and understanding these phenomena.",

Such information is now being measured for dozens of planets with state-of-the-art facilities using Bayesian atmosphere retrievals. We collect measurements of exoplanet composition of gas giants into a Library of Exoplanet Atmospheric Composition Measurements for comparison on a population level. We develop an open-source toolkit, ExoComp, to standardize between solar abundance, metallicity, and C/O ratio definitions. We find a systematic enhancement in the metallicity of exoplanets compared to T-dwarf and stellar populations, a strict bound in C/O between 0 and 1, and statistically significant differences between measurements from direct, eclipse, and transmission spectroscopy. In particular, the transit spectroscopy population exhibits a systematically lower C/O ratio compared to planets observed with eclipse and direct spectroscopy. While such differences may be astrophysical signals, we discuss many of the challenges and subtleties of such a comparison. We characterize the mass-metallicity trend, finding a slope consistent between planets measured in transit versus eclipse, but offset in metallicity. Compared to the Solar System and constraints from interior modeling, gas giant atmospheres appear to exhibit a steeper mass-metallicity trend. We hope that the tools available in ExoComp and the data in the Library of Exoplanet Atmospheric Composition Measurements can enhance the science return of the wide-array of space- and ground-based exoplanet science being undertaken by the community.",

We perform correlation analysis to study the time lags between different bands, which may be directly related to the size of the dust torus. After correcting for infrared flux contamination from the accretion disk and accounting for the redshift effect, we measure the Ks-optical and W1-optical lags for the targets VVV J1834-2925 and VVV J1845-2426. Using typical sublimation temperatures and reverberation time lags, we obtain a graphite-to-silicate grain size ratio of $\\frac{a_C}{a_S}\\sim$ 0.4.

        "abstract": "We present a multi-spacecraft analysis of the 2024 July 16 Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Flare (LDGRF) detected by the Large Area Telescope on the Fermi satellite. The measured >100 MeV $\\gamma$-ray emission persisted for over seven hours after the flare impulsive phase, and was characterized by photon energies exceeding 1 GeV and a remarkably-hard parent-proton spectrum. In contrast, the phenomena related to the coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock linked to this eruption were modest, suggesting an inefficient proton acceleration unlikely to achieve the energies well-above the 300 MeV pion-production threshold to account for the observed $\\gamma$-ray emission. Specifically, the CME was relatively slow (~600 km/s) and the accompanying interplanetary type-II/III radio bursts were faint and short-duration, unlike those typically detected during large events. In particular, the type-II emission did not extend to kHz frequencies and disappeared ~5.5 hours prior to the LDGRF end time. Furthermore, the associated solar energetic particle (SEP) event was very weak, short-duration, and limited to a few tens of MeV, even at magnetically well-connected spacecraft. These findings demonstrate that a very-fast CME resulting in a high-energy SEP event is not a necessary condition for the occurrence of LDGRFs, challenging the idea that the high-energy $\\gamma$-ray emission is produced by the back-precipitation of shock-accelerated ions into the solar surface. The alternative origin scenario based on local particle trapping and acceleration in large-scale coronal loops is instead favored by the observation of giant arch-like structures of hot plasma over the source region persisting for the entire duration of this LDGRF.",

These CT AGN are often difficult to detect with current instruments, but the X-ray data within the JWST-North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time Domain Field (TDF) present a unique opportunity to study faint and obscured AGN. The NEP contains the deepest NuSTAR survey to date, and Zhao et al. (2024) detected 60 hard X-ray sources from the combined exposure of NuSTAR's Cycle 5 and 6 observations. In this work, we utilize the NuSTAR Cycle 5+6+8+9 data and simultaneous XMM-Newton observations in order to perform the first spectroscopic analysis of the 60-source catalog. We present this analysis and measure the $N_{{\\mathrm{H}}}$ distribution of the sample. We measure an observed CT fraction of $0.13_{-0.04}^{+0.15}$ down to an observed $8-24$ keV flux of $6.0 \\times 10^{-14}$ erg/s/cm$^{2}$, and we correct our analysis for absorption bias to estimate an underlying CT fraction of $0.32_{-0.08}^{+0.23}$. The derived obscuration distribution and CT fraction are consistent with population synthesis models and previous surveys.",

        "abstract": "Tidal interactions influence the orbital motions of binary star systems and extrasolar planets alike. Tides also affect stellar and planetary rotation rates. We demonstrate that in addition to altering spin synchronization and pseudosynchronization, tidally driven inertial waves in the convective envelopes of low-mass stars and gas giant planets can enhance tidal eccentricity damping. Analytically, we find that eccentricity damping by inertial waves can be orders of magnitude faster than equilibrium tides, independent of any eddy viscosity prescription. We use simplified numerical experiments to demonstrate this enhancement, and to explore the effects of different mixing length treatments of convective turbulence, as well as a spin-down torque from magnetic braking. These calculations demonstrate that tidally driven inertial waves can produce an extended cool core of nearly circular binaries, helping to reconcile a longstanding discrepancy between observed and predicted main-sequence binary circularization. Our calculations additionally suggest that tidally driven inertial waves may leave identifiable signatures in the ratios of orbital to rotation periods for stellar binaries, including synchronous and sub-synchronous rotation periods reminiscent of populations identified in Kepler, TESS, and Gaia data.",

        "abstract": "Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.",

In this work, we extend the thermodynamic framework of black holes by incorporating charge and analyzing its role in entropy production. Using an analogy with charged rotating soap bubbles, we demonstrate that charge contributes to the total angular momentum and affects the entropy-event horizon relationship. By applying the Gouy-Stodola theorem, we establish a consistent thermodynamic formulation for charged black holes, showing that the first law of thermodynamics remains valid in this context. Furthermore, we explore the behavior of the partition function from the perspective of a distant observer, revealing that charge effects diminish with increasing distance. These findings reinforce the thermodynamic interpretation of black holes and provide insights into the interplay between charge, rotation, and entropy in gravitational systems.",

Meanwhile, inconsistencies in measurements of the curvature parameter $\\Omega_\\mathrm{K}$ between different datasets also have emerged. In this work, we employ two global and cosmic age-based parameterizations, PAge and MAPAge, to perform model-independent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and $\\Omega_\\mathrm{K}$ by utilizing the inverse distance ladder (IDL). To construct the PAge-improved IDL, we utilize the strong gravitational lensing (SGL), cosmic chronometers (CC), and gamma ray bursts (GRB) data to calibrate the latest DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation data and DESY5 type Ia supernova data. Our analysis indicate that DESI+DESY5+SGL+CC+GRB gives $H_0=71.59\\pm 0.94\\,{\\rm km}~{\\rm s}^{-1}~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ in the MAPAge model, reducing the $H_0$ tension to the $1.0\\sigma$ level. Extending to MAPAge$+\\Omega_{\\rm K}$ model, we obtain $\\Omega_\\mathrm{K}=0.001\\pm 0.038$, which suggests that current late-time data are consistent with a flat universe. Finally, the Bayesian analysis indicates that the present late-universe data provide weak to moderate evidence in favor of PAge and MAPAge relative to $\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}$.",

Grounded in accreditation standards such as ABET and NCAAA, the model introduces mathematical tools that map exercises, assessment questions, teaching units (TUs), and student assessment components (SACs) to CLOs and PLOs. This dual-layer approach-combining micro-level analysis of assessment elements with macro-level curriculum evaluation-enables detailed tracking of learning outcomes and helps identify misalignments between instructional delivery, assessment strategies, and program objectives. The framework incorporates alignment matrices, weighted relationships, and practical indicators to quantify coherence and evaluate course or program performance. Application of this model reveals gaps in outcome coverage and underscores the importance of realignment, especially when specific PLOs are underrepresented or CLOs are not adequately supported by assessments. The proposed model is practical, adaptable, and scalable, making it suitable for academic programs. Its systematic structure supports institutions in implementing evidence-based curriculum improvements and provides a reliable mechanism for aligning teaching practices with desired learning outcomes. Ultimately, this framework offers a valuable tool for closing the feedback loop between instructional design, assessment execution, and learning outcomes, thus promoting greater transparency, accountability, and educational effectiveness. Institutions that adopt this model can expect to strengthen their quality assurance processes and help ensure that students graduate with the competencies required by academic standards and professional expectations.",

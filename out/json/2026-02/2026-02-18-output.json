        "abstract": "To date no exoplanets have been detected outside the Milky Way, and their extragalactic occurrence rates are poorly constrained. Using available data from TESS we perform the first transit survey of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream using 15,176 main sequence stars identified as likely members. We calculate an upper limit of $<$1.01% for hot Jupiters with radii of 1-2 R$_{Jup}$ and periods of 0.6-10 days after detecting zero planets. We compare our calculated occurrence rate upper limits to the upper limits found in the Milky Way globular clusters M4 and 47 Tuc. Our 1-$\\sigma$ occurrence rate upper limit of $<$0.37% for the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy stream, for planets with radii of 1.5-2 R$_{Jup}$ and periods $<$10 days, is lower than the $<$0.57% upper limit measured in 47 Tuc. Similarly, our 2 sigma upper limit of $<$0.78% for planets with radii of 1.4-2 $_{Jup}$ and periods $<$8 days is below the $<$0.81% upper limit measured in M4. We predict that a future analysis of TESS data with a high detection efficiency for hot Jupiter transit depths would require $\\eta_{extragalactic}$ $\\geq$ 11,467 target stars to detect a planet of extragalactic origin. Therefore, we predict that a future investigation of TESS data which includes additional extragalactic stellar streams will be able to either detect the first extragalactic origin planet or provide evidence that older, lower metallicity extragalactic environments may experience a lower hot Jupiter occurrence rate than is observed for the Milky Way.",

        "abstract": "We have calibrated the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) using our recent catalog of homogeneous, high-accuracy Globular Cluster (GC) distances. The GC distances were determined by a global joint fit to optical period-Wesenheit relations of their member RR Lyrae stars and type-II Cepheids, anchored by trigonometric parallaxes; all data taken from the ESA Gaia mission's (early) third data release (GDR3). Using I-band measurements in 48 GCs from P. Stetson's database, we determined $M_{I,0} = -3.948^{+0.037}_{-0.034}$ mag (1.6% in distance). Calibrating the TRGB using Gaia's homogeneous, space-based RP photometry of 53 GCs, we found $M_{RP,0} = -3.807^{+0.041}_{-0.035}$ mag (1.8%). The stated uncertainties include statistical and systematic effects, including the correlated nature of the GC distances. The robustness of our calibrations is demonstrated via tests against small-number statistics and analysis choices. Specifically, we found no significant metallicity effect for our sample of old, low-metallicity GCs. We measured $\\sim 2\\%$ distances to the Large (LMC) and Small Magellanic Clouds (SMC), $18.447^{+0.036}_{-0.042}$ mag ($48.9 \\pm 0.9$ kpc) and $18.898^{+0.049}_{-0.054}$ mag ($60.2 \\pm 1.4$ kpc), respectively, using a single well calibrated photometric system: RP (spectro-)photometry from GDR3. Our new TRGB distances, whose absolute scale derives from Gaia parallaxes, are fully independent of the well-known detached eclipsing binary (DEB) distances and agree with them to within the uncertainties. Combining our new TRGB and existing DEB distances, we illustrate how additional constraints may be incorporated in the Local Distance Network and obtain $H_0 = 73.52 \\pm 0.80$ km/s/Mpc.

        "abstract": "Carbon stars on the asymptotic giant branch are major contributors to galactic dust enrichment, with gas mass-loss rates up to 1e-4 Msun/yr. We present a homogeneous spectral energy distribution analysis of the Gaia DR3 Golden Sample of carbon stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. Our dataset includes 14,747 sources with multi-band photometry from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE, combined with recent distance and extinction estimates. For a subsample of 2,494 Mira variables, we model multi-band light curves to derive accurate mean magnitudes.   Stellar and circumstellar parameters are obtained by fitting observations with a large grid of synthetic spectra computed with the DUSTY radiative transfer code using COMARCS atmospheres. We derive effective temperature, optical depth, and gas mass-loss rate for each source. The distributions peak around Teff = 3150 K, with mass-loss rates spanning 1e-11 to 1e-4 Msun/yr and inner dust temperatures near 1000 K. We find a correlation between variability amplitude and mass-loss rate.   This framework provides a statistically robust view of carbon stars across environments with different metallicities. Apparent environmental dependencies are influenced by luminosity distributions and selection effects rather than purely intrinsic metallicity differences. The combined Gaia and WISE selection limits the detection of both highly obscured and faint Magellanic Cloud sources, but the observed trends remain significant within the sampled populations.",

        "abstract": "[ABRIDGED] Galaxy evolution is shaped by internal and external mechanisms that regulate the baryon cycle and star formation activity. We present a theoretical framework based on the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) semi-analytic model. We extracted portions of simulated volumes that include isolated galaxies, pairs, group, and filament members at z ~ 0, specifically avoiding massive clusters. Galaxies were classified using both intrinsic (halo-based) and observational (2D projected) parameterizations, reconstructing their environmental histories from z = 2 and identifying mergers, tidal interactions, ram pressure stripping (RPS), and starvation. 2D information decreases isolated and group fractions while doubles pairs. More than half of galaxies remain unaffected by the investigated processes since z = 2. Among affected galaxies, mergers dominate at high stellar masses (40-60% at log(M*/Msun) > 10.5). Tidal interactions are less frequent, and their incidence increases with stellar mass. RPS dominates in groups and filaments at intermediate masses (~50%), while starvation ranges from 20 to 30%. The incidence of the different mechanisms depends strongly on both mass and environment, though their imprints on global properties are often subtle. Distinct evolutionary pathways emerge: log(M*/Msun) < 9.5, galaxies in groups and filaments have a faster mass growth than galaxies in the other environments, especially those undergoing starvation, mergers and, to less extent, RPS. Differences are reduced moving to higher masses, where no clear dependence on physical mechanism emerge, even though at these masses a clear star formation suppression is evident in mergers and starved galaxies. This theoretical investigation provides essential context for the recently started multi-wavelength program Mechanisms Affecting Galaxies Nearby and Environmental Trends (MAGNET), which we introduce here.",

These diagnostics have rarely been studied together during the modern era of high-resolution solar flare observations, and never at the spectral and spatial resolution of the DKIST. We directly compare DKIST spectra to state-of-the-art RADYN+RH simulations, including one heated by a nonthermal electron beam and one by in-situ thermal conduction. While certain salient properties of the spectra such as the width of H-epsilon are reproduced, the models severely underestimate the width of Ca II H in the red wing and fail to reproduce the exact relative intensity of Ca II H to H-epsilon. The models exhibit a range of condensation electron densities spanning over an order of magnitude. Unlike the modeled lower-order Balmer-series lines, we find that the width of H-epsilon is not solely related to the condensation properties; the widths and intensities are also sensitive to the deeper flare layers. We outline possible avenues towards improvement of flare models, such as a comprehensive evaluation of flare heating mechanisms in the context of both impulsive and decay phase high-resolution data.",

        "abstract": "Hot subluminous stars (sdO/B) are evolved low mass stars originating from red giants that lost their envelope almost entirely. The multitude of observed phenomena imply that several pathways may form hot subdwarfs, most involving close binary channels. The Hamburg Quasar Survey (HQS) led to the discovery of many faint blue stars including hot subdwarf. Many of the HQS-sdB stars have been studied in detail, but analyses of the helium-rich sdOB and sdO stars are lacking. The recent development of hybrid LTE/non-LTE model spectra 2nd generation Bamberg model grids enables us to improve the spectroscopic analyses of the sdB stars as well as of the previously unstudied sdO stars allowing precise atmospheric parameters to be derived, while consistently accounting for parameter correlations and systematic uncertainties. ... We use spectral energy distributions to identify composite-colour sdB binaries and present the result of detailed spectroscopic analyses of 122 non-composite subdwarfs from the HQS to identify potential evolutionary pathways. ...Their derived mass distribution and median mass of 0.45 Msun is consistent with the canonical EHB mass. ... The helium-rich sdOB and sdO stars, are found near the helium main-sequence (He-MS). The derived mass distribution of the extremely He-rich subdwarfs is broader (0.48 to 1.05 Msun) and peaks at a median of 0.70 Msun, significantly larger than those of the hydrogen-rich stars. Intermediate He-rich subdwarfs are also He-MS stars, but of lower mass (0.55 Msun) than the extremely He-rich. This strongly supports the merger scenario for the origin of He-rich sdO stars, in which two helium white dwarfs merge following orbital decay driven by gravitational-wave emission, producing a He-rich sdO or sdOB star. From comparison to the results of similar studies we speculate that older populations produce more massive He-WD mergers.(abbreviated)",

Most theoretical work is based on analytic calculations or idealised simulations, which has yielded several theories of spiral structure. The radial profile of the spiral arm rotation speed - the pattern speed - is a key observable prediction of these theories. However, observations that infer spiral pattern speeds reveal a mixed picture with no clear consensus. Here, we expand on theoretical efforts by examining the pattern speed profiles in the Auriga Superstars set of high-resolution cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulatons of Milky Way-mass spiral disc galaxies. These simulations combine galaxy formation in a cosmological environment with the high dynamical fidelity afforded by an $\\sim 800$ $\\rm M_{\\odot}$ star particle resolution, giving $\\sim 100$ million star particles in the disc. We show that several different spiral arm theories are realised among our simulations, including large-scale kinematic density waves, manifold spirals, dynamic (co-rotating) spirals, and overlapping modes. In particular, we demonstrate that a strong tidal interaction leads to clear kinematic density waves, and that manifold spirals are present in a strongly-barred galaxy. Interestingly, we find that the same galaxy may show qualitative evolution of their spiral pattern speed profiles, indicating that the nature of spiral arms can evolve on potentially sub-Gigayear timescales. Our results demonstrate that in the absence of a strong external encounter or a strong bar, galactic spiral structure is highly transitional and complex with no clear long-lived underlying wave.",

The star-forming gas (SFG) in HII regions and young stars (YSs) trace the recent evolutionary history of the galaxy. We aim to assess the extent to which the joint analysis of metallicity gradient alignment in YSs and SFG can constrain the recent evolutionary history of galaxies. Using the high-resolution run of the EAGLE project, we derived radial, azimuthally averaged oxygen abundance profiles for YSs (age < 2 Gyr) and SFG and measured their gradients as the slopes of linear fits to these profiles. We classified galaxies into four groups based on the signs (N for negative and P for positive) of the slopes: NN, NP, PP, and PN (the first letter is for YSs and the second for SFG). We found that galaxies with NN, NP, PP, and PN combinations of metallicity profiles reflect different evolutionary paths over the past ~ 2 Gyr. NN galaxies exhibit sustained inside-out growth accompanied by high star formation efficiency, whereas NP and PP systems show evidence of recent or ongoing feedback-driven disruption, with PP galaxies likely being predominantly shaped by supernova feedback. PN galaxies, by contrast, show evidence of past violent events followed by gradient recovery, highlighting the interplay between inflows, feedback, and gas cooling in shaping metallicity distributions. The degree of alignment between the stellar and gas metallicity gradients provides a way to time the occurrence of significant events in the evolutionary history of galaxies, which contribute through a combination of gas inflows, star formation triggering, and metal mixing. They could also serve as probes of sub-grid physics when observations provide suitable comparison datasets. [Abridged]",

Because these features are extremely faint, alternative tracers such as globular clusters (GCs) provide a powerful tool to study cluster assembly. We use deep VLT/FORS $V$- and $I$-band imaging to investigate the GC population in the nearby Hydra I galaxy cluster ($\\sim 45.7$ Mpc). GC candidates were selected from the $VI$ colour-magnitude diagram and divided into blue and red subpopulations. We find a clear spatial dichotomy: red GCs are concentrated around the massive central galaxies NGC 3311 and NGC 3309, while blue GCs are more extended and offset from the centre, coinciding with a secondary peak of X-ray-emitting gas. In the central regions, GC spatial distributions further depend on stellar population properties: young metal-rich GCs are more extended and may be linked to ram-pressure stripping, whereas old metal-poor GCs are more centrally concentrated, possibly originating from disrupted dwarf galaxies. Comparing the GC number density profiles to the surface brightness profile of NGC 3311, we find that the red GCs closely follow the galaxy light, while the blue population significantly deviates from it and traces the global gravitational potential of the cluster. This is also reflected in the specific frequency of blue GCs, which is approximately $\\sim 5\\times$ higher in the ICL-dominated outskirts than in the inner regions dominated by red GCs. Finally, we present a novel method to constrain the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function of the cluster using GC specific frequencies and colour distributions, yielding a past faint-end slope of $\\alpha=-1.81^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ compared to $\\alpha=-1.41^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ today, consistent with high-redshift observations and cosmological simulations.",

If the atmosphere is near hydrostatic equilibrium and is stable to convection, then it can remain nearly homogeneous, as long as it is not too dense. But if its density is great enough, it becomes prone to producing a rain of cold clouds that fall toward the galaxy's center and accrete onto its central black hole. Here we explain how relatively weak magnetic fields enhance a galactic atmosphere's tendency to produce cold clouds and how the cold gas becomes organized into vertically elongated, highly magnetized filaments descending at sub-Keplerian speeds. It is intended to complement recent numerical simulations of the process and to serve as a guide to interpreting both simulations and observations of the filamentary gas in hot galactic atmospheres.",

        "abstract": "In solar-like stars, acoustic modes provide the main way of probing their internal structure and dynamics. Although these modes are expected to be ubiquitous in stars with convective envelopes, Kepler observations reveal that a significant fraction of solar-like stars show no detectable acoustic modes, particularly among rapidly rotating and magnetically active stars. Recent theoretical work by Bessila et al. (2025) has proposed that rotation tends to inhibit convective motions, thereby reducing the power available for stochastic mode excitation. Here, we test this prediction using fully compressible hydrodynamical simulations of a solar-like star. We perform a series of 2.5D simulations, which consider longitudinal symmetry, using the MUSIC code spanning rotation rates from 0 to 8 $\\Omega_{\\odot}$. We find a clear and systematic decline of acoustic mode amplitudes with increasing rotation rate. In the most rapidly rotating models, mode damping rates are also enhanced. The combined reduction in excitation and increase in damping with increasing rotation rate provide a physical explanation for the observed decrease in mode detectability in rapidly rotating solar-like stars. Our results demonstrate that rotation can significantly modify oscillation properties and must be accounted for when interpreting asteroseismic observations.",

        "abstract": "Current observational and simulated large-scale structure (LSS) catalogues often lack consistency in assigning galaxies to specific structures, due to the absence of a universally accepted classification criterion. With the aim to generate synthetic empirical data for fine-tuning LSS classification algorithms, as well as to train machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) models for the same purpose, this work presents a purely geometrical simulation based on statistical spatial properties found in LSS surveys, using the spectroscopic main galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogue up to a redshift of z~0.1 as a specific use case. A parallelism between the LSS and the Voronoi tessellation was utilised, in which the nodes, links, surfaces, and cells of the diagram correspond to clusters, filaments, walls, and voids, respectively. The simulation used random positions within voids as seeds for tessellating the 3D space. The resulting structures were randomly populated with galaxies that adhere to the statistical properties of their observational respective structures. As the galaxies were generated, they were tagged with their corresponding structure. In each simulation, six LSS mock catalogues were generated, following the statistical behaviour observed in the SDSS catalogue, depending on the structure they belong to. The Malmquist bias and the Fingers of God effect were simulated as well. We present a novel geometrical LSS simulator, where generated galaxies mimic the statistical properties of their observational belonging structure. The simulator was tuned to mimic the SDSS catalogue, although any other catalogue can be considered. With the generated catalogue, it is possible to adjust the LSS classification algorithms, train and test ML/DL models, and benchmark several LSS classification methods using this pre-labelled data to contrast their results and performance.",

        "abstract": "Barium stars are unusually enriched in barium ([Ba/Fe] >= 1.0 dex) and not predicted by current Galactic chemical evolution models. Previous observations of barium stars have found evidence that they form through mass transfer from a companion asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star or through radiative levitation. The chemical abundance and kinematic information of barium stars may help constrain AGB stellar nucleosynthesis, binary star evolution, and internal evolutionary processes that affect surface abundances. Using ~450,000 stars from the GALactic Archaeology with Hermes (GALAH) survey, we identify nearly 3000 new barium-rich stars and separate them into hot (Teff > 6000 K) and cool (Teff = 1.4), compared to 16.3% of a comparable sample of the GALAH field, suggesting multiplicity plays an important role in the formation of both populations of barium stars. A subset of hot barium stars exhibit low RUWE (RUWE < 1.2) and [alpha/Fe] < -0.2, supporting radiative levitation as an origin as well. We determine Galactic memberships using both kinematics and chemistry and find that barium stars exist in the thin disk, thick disk, and halo though they are slightly more prevalent at lower metallicities. Overall, we show evidence for barium stars produced by mass transfer and for those produced by radiative levitation, with both formation mechanisms occurring ubiquitously across the Galaxy.",

Unusually for an ETG, the GMCs of NGC 1387 follow scaling relations very similar to those of the Milky Way disc and Local Group galaxy clouds, and most are virialised. GMCs with large masses and radii and/or small galactocentric distances have their angular momenta aligned with the large-scale galactic rotation, while other GMCs do not.

Using the multizone framework -- designed to capture bidirectional inflow--outflow from the event horizon to the Bondi scale -- we present a suite of long-duration GRMHD simulations spanning BH spins $|a_\\ast|=0$--0.9 and Bondi radii $R_B/r_g=4\\times10^2$--$2\\times10^6$. From these simulations we derive spin-dependent subgrid prescriptions from first principles, applicable to hot accretion flows with low-Eddington ratios ($f_{\\rm Edd}\\lesssim10^{-3}$), for adoption in cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models. We provide compact analytic fits for the time-averaged accretion rate $\\dot M(R_B,a_\\ast)$ and feedback power $\\dot E_{\\rm fb}(R_B,a_\\ast)$ with respect to the Bondi rate $\\dot{M}_B$, which are largely insensitive to the initial gas configuration and magnetic field strength. To capture intrinsic time-variability, we also quantify the full distributions of $\\dot M$ and feedback efficiency $\\eta$, both well described by lognormal statistics, with widths that increase toward larger $R_B$. We further measure self-consistent spin evolution in the hot accretion mode, finding that the spin-up parameter varies as $s(a_\\ast)\\simeq -3.7\\,a_\\ast$, which implies a very long spindown timescale $t_s\\simeq 12(10^{-3}/f_{\\rm Edd})\\,{\\rm Gyr}$. Thus, BH spins are effectively frozen during phases of quiescent accretion. Compared to conventional small-domain GRMHD calculations, our simulations, which reach dynamical equilibrium across horizon-to-galaxy scales, yield systematically different long-term accretion, feedback, and spin properties, cautioning against direct extrapolation from small-scale GRMHD simulations when constructing galactic-scale subgrid models.",

MOCAdb provides a census of memberships for 10259 associations and open clusters within 500 pc of the Sun, with a comprehensive compilation of literature measurements such as spectral types, kinematics, rotation periods, activity indices, spectral indices, and photometry. All known substellar objects are cataloged in MOCAdb, along with 2943 public spectra, to enable the characterization of substellar association members. MOCAdb also features periodically updated calculations such as Galactic UVW space velocities. We use this compilation to construct mappings between independent association definitions, and to update the BANYAN $\\Sigma$ membership classification tool, which now includes 8125 associations. The BANYAN $\\Sigma$ model construction is improved to account for heterogeneous and correlated errors and to capture complex association shapes using Gaussian mixture models. Combined with Gaia DR3, this enabled us to identify 11535 yet unrecognized candidate members of young associations within 500 pc, mostly M dwarfs. Our results corroborate a recent observation that systematics up to $\\approx$4 km/s remain in Gaia DR3 radial velocities for A-type stars. We present an updated census of age-calibrated exoplanets and substellar objects: 134 age-calibrated exoplanet systems (plus 121 TESS exoplanet candidates), 99 of which did not appear to have known memberships so far, and 455 substellar (L0 or later) candidate members of young associations, 196 of which appear newly recognized.

The supernova remnant (SNR) G292.0+1.8 is one of only three known oxygen-rich SNRs in the galaxy-remnants of core-collapse for which relatively pure fragments of ejecta can be seen. Several dozen ejecta knots from G292.0+1.8 were the subject of a proper motion analysis, based on [O III] 5007-Angstrom images taken over a 22-year baseline by Winkler et al. 2009 (arXiv:0810.1935). They determined that the transverse velocities of the filaments are linearly proportional to their distances from a common expansion center, thus the O-rich filaments have been traveling with little deceleration since the initial supernova event,about 3000 years ago. In this paper, we use optical spectra of G292.0+1.8, all taken from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), to measure radial velocities for 93 knots. Assuming un-decelerated expansion, as indi- cated by the proper motions, the radial velocity should be proportional to the distance from the center along the line of sight, just as the proper motions are proportional to the transverse distance. Therefore, we can map the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of the SNR. We find that the knots generally follow a broad bi-conical distribution, suggesting that the supernova explosion produced broad jets of ejecta. This structure is similar to that seen in some other young core-collapse supernova remnants.",

Our results provide strong evidence for significant differences ($\\sim$3$\\sigma$) between the triggering mechanisms of the different sub-types of powerful radio AGN. The high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs) show a high rate of morphological disturbance (62$^{+6}_{-7}$ per cent) -- an excess of $\\sim$4$\\sigma$ compared with the control sample -- consistent with them being predominantly triggered in galaxy mergers and interactions. In contrast, the low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) show a much lower rate of morphological disturbance (36$^{+7}_{-6}$ per cent), consistent with the control sample, and suggesting a different dominant triggering mechanism, such as the accretion of gas from the hot X-ray haloes of the host galaxies or galaxy clusters. We also demonstrate that, when considering the radio morphology, the FRII HERG sources preferentially reside in disturbed morphologies, a difference of $\\sim$3$\\sigma$ to the FRII LERG objects.

The 21cm signal, however, is intrinsically highly non-Gaussian, limiting the effectiveness of conventional two-point cross-correlation statistics, which capture information only up to the second order. In this work, we therefore investigate the utility of k-nearest-neighbour cumulative distribution functions (kNN CDF), which encode information from the joint clustering at all orders, as an alternative framework for probing 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations. Using self-consistently simulated mock 21cm fields and a catalog of line-emitting galaxies at z = 7, we conducted a proof-of-concept study comparing the kNN CDF formalism and the two-point cross-correlation approach. We find that the kNN CDF statistics outperform the two-point statistics in detecting 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations, even in the presence of instrumental noise and aggressive foreground filtering. Moreover, at a fixed global ionized fraction, it is even able to differentiate between reionization models that remain indistinguishable using two-point statistics. These results demonstrate the power and unexplored potential of exploiting higher-order statistics for extracting maximal information from 21cm-galaxy synergies.",

PIFF is widely used in leading weak-lensing surveys, including the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The PSF characterizes how a point source, such as a star, is imaged after its light traverses the atmosphere and telescope optics, effectively representing the \"blurred fingerprint'' of the entire imaging system. Accurate PSF modeling is essential for weak gravitational lensing analyses, as biases in its estimation propagate directly into cosmic shear measurements -- one of the primary cosmological probes of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of large-scale structure for dark energy studies. To address the limitations of PIFF, which constructs PSF models independently for each CCD and therefore loses spatial coherence across the focal plane, we introduce a deep-learning-based framework for PSF reconstruction. In this approach, an autoencoder is trained on stellar images obtained with the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) of the Subaru Telescope and combined with a Gaussian process to interpolate the PSF across the telescope's full field of view. This hybrid model captures systematic variations across the focal plane and achieves a reconstruction error of $3.4 \\times 10^{-6}$ compared to PIFF's $3.7 \\times 10^{-6}$, laying the foundation for integration into the LSST Science Pipelines.",

This CML simulates the viscoelastic and chaotic dynamics and evolution of gas clumps containing a little dust with a minimal set of one Eulerian procedure for the flow formation of gas clumps due to gravitational interaction, and one Lagrangian procedure for the collision and mixture of gas clumps due to viscoelastic advection. Despite its simplicity, this CML successfully obtains four typical astronomical objects consistent with protoplanetary disk observations: a central star, Keplerian disk, spiral arms, and even stellar, substellar, and planetary companions. All these formation processes are truly dynamic, with the central star \"starring\" in them, and they are not based on the conventional disk gravitational instability but on the central star gravitational instability with high-dimensional chaotic gas ejection, namely the chaotic itinerancy. Of particular note is the process in which diverse companions are formed due to the rapid density increase caused by the intersection of spiral arms. This suggests a novel companion formation scenario that should be called \"arm-crossing companion formation\" with a view to planet formation, which may overcome the radial drift barrier and angular momentum problem.",

        "abstract": "Type II supernovae (SNe II) have been traditionally separated into several subgroups based on their photometric and spectroscopic properties, but whether these represent distinct progenitors or a continuous distribution remains debated. Over the past decade, growing observational evidence has suggested a possible continuity between slow- (IIP) and fast-declining (IIL) SNe. We investigate the continuity of the SNe IIP/L subclasses through a data-driven statistical analysis of spectral time series, aiming to determine whether significant correlations exist between overall spectral shapes and light-curve decline rates. We introduce a novel standardization method for SN II spectra. After empirically flattening the spectra via continuum normalization, we interpolate the resulting \"feature spectra\" onto a fixed grid of epochs using Gaussian Process regression. The interpolated spectra are then analyzed using Principal Component Analysis to explore correlations. We find that SNe IIP and IIL form a continuum spectroscopically, though some clustering remains. The spectral diversity is characterized mainly by two components: one continuous group with well-defined P-Cygni profiles and another with \"less-regular\" features likely driven by enhanced circumstellar material (CSM) interaction. Our results reveal that the spectral diversity of SNe IIP/L diminishes over time. We confirm observational correlations: steeper light-curve declines correspond to weaker spectral features, indicating that SNe IIL tend to show weaker emission and, in some cases, a lack of distinct absorption lines. These trends seemingly break down by enhanced CSM interaction that affects the P-Cygni profiles. Our data-driven method reveals underlying spectral correlations and supports a continuous distribution between IIP and IIL subtypes. This method paves the way for more refined classification algorithms.",

The quasar (QSO) number densities are a powerful probe for understanding the effects of intervening material. Absorption lines in QSO spectra reveal the presence of interstellar and intergalactic gas, which can change observed fluxes through dust extinction and plasma lensing. By combining observations from radio (VLASS), infrared (WISE), and optical bands (DESI), we assembled a sample of QSOs: ~4000 sources with MgII absorbers, and ~12, 000 non-absorbers. In the radio band, the MgII sample shows a moderate excess at the bright end of the flux distribution, which is broadly consistent with plasma lensing predications. In the optical, the MgII sample turns over at higher g-band fluxes and exhibits a steeper decline at the faint end than the non-MgII sample. Control samples were constructed by matching in redshift, infrared (W1), and optical (g) luminosities. In these comparisons, the radio excess becomes less prominent, suggesting that the apparent magnification may not be robust evidence for plasma lensing. Nevertheless, a weak contribution cannot be ruled out, especially given residual excess observed at the bright end relative to the non-MgII sample. Dust extinction along the line-of-sight remains a plausible alternative. Regardless of the dominant mechanism, the multi-wavelength differences offer a valuable probe of the physical state of the intervening medium.",

Similarly, the AGN and controls do not show strong differences in their rest-frame $(u-z)$ colours or local environment, suggesting that neither the recent star formation histories nor the surroundings of the AGN are strongly atypical of the general galaxy population. This study provides a glimpse into forthcoming AGN science using the LSST. With vastly improved statistics, LSST will offer unprecedented insights into AGN demographics, host-galaxy evolution and the processes that fuel supermassive black holes, potentially reshaping our understanding of their place in the Universe.",

Existing studies of gravitational wave production from evaporating PBHs typically assume vacuum evaporation, neglecting the fact that PBHs in the early Universe are embedded in a hot thermal plasma. In this work, we investigate gravitational wave production from primordial black holes whose evaporation is thermally influenced by their surrounding environment. We adopt a thermal evaporation framework in which interactions with the ambient plasma modify the effective decay rate of the black hole, leading to enhanced mass loss at early times and a redistribution of the evaporation history compared to the standard non-thermal vacuum case. Since graviton emission is intrinsically tied to the evaporation history of PBHs, these thermal effects play a crucial role in determining the timing and spectral properties of the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background. Our results provide a consistent framework for incorporating thermal effects into gravitational wave production from evaporating primordial black holes and set the stage for a detailed analysis of their observational signatures.",

        "abstract": "Spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric observations, which rely on the Doppler effect, only provide access to the line-of-sight component of the solar plasma velocity (vz). However, many dynamic processes in the solar atmosphere involve strong horizontal motions (in the plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight: vx, vy). Existing methods for estimating horizontal velocities are generally insensitive to variations in height (the z-coordinate), providing them only on a single plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight: vx(x,y), vy(x,y). Motivated by the fact that modern analysis techniques allow us to retrieve the height dependence of vz and B, our goal is to infer also this height dependence for the horizontal velocity field in the solar atmosphere. As a first step, we present, and test a method for the two-dimensional case on the (y,z) plane so as to show that the z dependence can be successfully retrieved. The components of the two-dimensional magnetic induction equation are discretized via finite differences, leading to an overdetermined system whose solution provides vy. The method assumes that B, its time variation, as well as vz are known. This is currently possible through modern Stokes inversion techniques applied to spatially and temporally resolved spectropolarimetric observations. Using analytically prescribed values and two-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the solar surface, we demonstrate that, in these idealized cases, the horizontal velocity component in a two-dimensional domain, can be successfully recovered with a mean error of about 1 %. The proposed method successfully retrieves the horizontal velocity field in the (y,z) plane, thereby establishing the foundation for future extensions to three-dimensional reconstructions of the horizontal velocity field.",

The method exploits analytic structure in the relevant Wigner-3j symbol configurations appearing in temperature and polarization coupling matrices, expressing all required quantities in terms of a small set of recurrence-generated values which are precomputed and stored in lookup tables. This approach reduces the computational cost of constructing the full coupling matrices whilst maintaining numerical accuracy.   We demonstrate the performance of the threej_cosmo implementation using realistic survey masks from current CMB experiments. Relative to standard recursion-based approaches used in existing pseudo-C_l pipelines, the method achieves speedups of 6-25x in practical coupling-matrix constructions, with the largest gains occurring at high multipoles. The algorithm admits efficient parallelisation on both CPUs and GPUs, the latter providing additional acceleration, up to a further order of 50 on modern hardware, without altering the underlying formalism.   Beyond full matrix construction, the approach is naturally suited to applications in which only a restricted set of l3 modes is required for each (l1,l2) pair, such as in the computation of band-limited coupling matrices and analytic covariance terms. These features make threej_cosmo a practical backend for pseudo-C_l estimation and related calculations in next-generation CMB analysis pipelines.",

In this paper, we show that in a broad class of single-field inflation models with sufficiently small energy scales, an extremely efficient tachyonic instability develops at the end of inflation. This instability rapidly drives the system into a nonlinear regime before coherent oscillations can be established, leading to a first-order phase-transition--like phenomenon without tunneling or barrier crossing. The resulting ultra-relativistic shock fronts surrounding the bubble interiors expand to near the Hubble scale, corresponding to the most strongly enhanced tachyonic modes, and collide with one another, producing energetic inflaton particles and gravitational waves. As a result, the post-inflationary dynamics can differ significantly from the conventional high-scale inflationary scenario. Interestingly, inflation at MeV--EeV energy scales can be probed via gravitational-wave observations, including pulsar timing arrays, ground-based detectors, and future space-based experiments. Recent limits from the LIGO--KAGRA--Virgo collaboration already constrain EeV-scale inflation, while pulsar timing array results may be interpreted as evidence for gravitational waves generated by GeV-scale inflation. We also briefly discuss further implications of the resulting tachyonic shocks.",

Moreover, also the starburst ring of these sources is bright in the radio and hence, a potential source of $\\gamma$-rays and neutrinos.   We aim to explain the non-thermal features of these two sources with our homogeneous steady-state Seyfert-starburst composite model, which we refined in this work. Hereby, we account for stochastic diffuse acceleration and energy losses within the corona and $\\gamma\\gamma$-pair attenuation of the escaping $\\gamma$-rays. Since the non-thermal features of Seyfert sources contribute only marginally to the electromagnetic spectrum, only few data points can be assigned to the starburst ring or the AGN corona. Hence, prior information on the physical parameters is incorporated within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to avoid overfitting.   Based on this Bayesian parameter study we show, that the non-thermal features of NGC 1068 can be explained well. Still a more detailed treatment of the spatial inhomogeneities in the central region of the AGN could further improve the fit results. This manifests itself even more clearly in the case of NGC 7469, where the mm-bump needs to emerge from a coronal size $R_{\\rm c}>100\\,\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm s}$, whereas (TeV-PeV)-neutrino emission requires $R_{\\rm c}< 10\\,\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm s}$. Similar to what has previously been shown in other wavebands, our analysis highlights that the spatial extension of the so-called AGN corona depends the considered energy of the messenger. Hence, it seems that there is not a unique edge of the corona and a substantial progress in the understanding of these phenomena is expected if future analysis account for these spatial inhomogeneities.",

The inherently nonlinear nature of such motion, shaped by general relativity, makes direct analysis highly challenging. To overcome this, pseudo-Newtonian potentials are used to approximate relativistic effects within a Newtonian framework. In this study, we model the central SMBH using the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov (1996) potential to mimic the rotational effects of a Kerr-like black hole. The surrounding prolate halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution, represented through a multipole expansion including dipole and quadrupole components.

C 92, no.5, 052801 (2015), Phys. Rev. C 106, no.5, 055806 (2022)]. For representative choices $f_s=0$ (no cutoff) and $f_s=0.58$ (stiffened), we solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff and tidal perturbation equations to obtain equilibrium sequences, mass-radius relations, and tidal deformabilities. We then derive and solve the linear general-relativistic radial pulsation equations to compute the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the fundamental and overtone modes. The $\\sigma$-cutoff suppresses the growth of the scalar field at supranuclear density, increases the pressure, and shifts the maximum mass, radii, and $\\Lambda_{1.4}$ accordingly, while systematically raising the radial-mode frequencies at fixed mass. Using the sign change of $\\omega_0^2$ as a stability criterion, we identify stiffened models that remain radially stable up to the observed $\\sim 2M_\\odot$ mass scale and are consistent with current multimessenger constraints, demonstrating how radial spectra complement static EoS tests.",

        "abstract": "We consider the early binary neutron star inspiral phase as a scenario to probe environmental axion--photon resonant conversion. For this we approximately model the merger site electromagnetic fields as the superposition of two rotating dipolar stellar magnetic fields at the thousand--km scale when both magnetospheres are not largely distorted. We capture the time-sliced near-zone magnetospheric geometry relevant for axion--photon mixing. Plasma effects are incorporated through an effective Goldreich--Julian charge density, used to determine the effective plasma frequency and the location of resonant conversion surfaces. Our results show that axion--photon resonant conversion in binary magnetospheres mostly occurs on extended peanut-shaped surfaces whose global geometry evolves as the binary inspiral evolves. As a consequence, the total electromagnetic power emitted through axion--photon conversion exhibits a characteristic dependence on axion mass and a slow temporal modulation correlated with the gravitational wave frequency emission. This feature is potentially detectable for $m_a \\in [50,170] \\,\\rm \\mu eV$ and set $g_{a \\gamma} \\lesssim 10^{-11}\\rm \\,GeV^{-1}$ as it lies within the sensitivity limits of current or planned radio observation missions.

        "abstract": "Non-trivial spatial topology of the Universe can imprint potentially observable signatures on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this study, we investigate how deviations from the standard nearly-scale-free primordial power spectrum impact observables for the fully compact, orientable Euclidean topologies ($E_1$--$E_6$). We examine how such deviations modify the detectability of the underlying topology, depending on whether they are an intrinsic consequence of non-trivial topology or independent of it. We compute CMB temperature correlation matrices across a range of topologies, fundamental domain sizes, and observer locations for both standard and modified primordial power spectra. The impact of these modifications on the detectability of topology is quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, providing an estimate of the distinguishability of non-trivial and simply-connected topologies based solely on CMB temperature observations. In addition, we employ the CatBoost machine learning algorithm to classify harmonic-space realizations of CMB temperature maps and thereby assess the observational prospects for topology detection. Signatures of non-trivial topology are encoded in the off-diagonal structure of the CMB temperature correlation matrices and are most prominent on the largest angular scales. Deviations from the simple power-law primordial spectrum at these scales can substantially alter the detectability of topology, either enhancing its characteristic CMB imprints or suppressing them below observational sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in the primordial power spectrum must be carefully accounted for in robust searches for cosmic topology using the CMB.",

We first study the motion of neutral test particles and derive the fundamental orbital and epicyclic frequencies, which are then employed to analyze different quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) models. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schr\\\"{o}dinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $\\zeta$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum. Finally, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the black hole entropy and obtain the logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. We show that these corrections become important for small black holes, while for large horizon radius the standard thermodynamic behavior is recovered. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum correction parameter leaves observable imprints on both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the spacetime and can be constrained through QPO observations.",

Using nonstandard global monopole solutions as a toy model for realistic particles, we show that the spatial average of $F$ typically differs significantly from $F$ evaluated at the spatially averaged trace of $T$, implying that homogeneous cosmological models generally fail to capture the correct large-scale dynamics of the Universe. We further show that dust in these theories generally exhibits a non-vanishing proper pressure.

The interaction between these plasma cells and the Sun's magnetic field provides valuable insights into plasma dynamics near the solar surface and how they evolve in the presence of magnetic fields. This study analyses the morphological characteristics of solar convective cells, investigating the relationship between magnetic field properties and granule dynamics - specifically how granule area, shape, and brightness vary under different magnetic field conditions. Observations of the active region NOAA 11768 were taken with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). A segmentation algorithm was applied to continuum intensity images to identify individual granules and determine their sizes, shapes, and mean brightness. The magnetic field vector and line-of-sight velocity were derived from CRISP spectropolarimetric data to investigate their role in shaping granule properties. We find that granular area decreases systematically with increasing magnetic field strength, with the largest granules occurring in non-magnetic regions and a mean granule area of approximately 1.58 arcsec$^2$ (effective diameter of 1.42 arcseconds). Both mean continuum intensity and granule size decrease with stronger fields, confirming the suppression of convective energy transport in magnetised regions. No correlation was found between mean granule brightness and mean up-flow velocity. Highly elongated granules appear in both magnetic and non-magnetic regions, while near-circular granules are exclusive to non-magnetic areas. An alignment between granule major axes and magnetic field azimuth is observed where the horizontal field component is strong, confirming that granules are highly sensitive to magnetic fields, which inhibit the lateral expansion of convective cells.",

This is particularly true for g-modes, whose frequency and tidal coupling are highly sensitive to the composition of NSs, especially in their centers, where microphysical models are the least reliable. However, due to their weak coupling to external tidal fields, their effect on the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary inspirals can be difficult to observe. Here we show that the detectability of these tides can be significantly enhanced by binary NSs with moderate eccentricities. This is primarily due to higher eccentric harmonics in the early phase of the binary evolution experiencing larger phase shifts, which they transport to the sensitive band of GW detectors. In addition, g-mode tides in eccentric binaries undergo several epicyclic resonances, which also amplify the total phase shift. We demonstrate that these effects increase the detectability of g-mode dynamical tides by more than an order of magnitude for eccentricities of $e_\\mathrm{10Hz}\\sim0.2-0.4$, making it possible to put robust constraints on g-mode properties using current GW detectors, while all relevant models could potentially be constrained with eccentric binary NSs with Einstein Telescope.",

Such triggers are essential for coordinating rapid electromagnetic follow-up. In this work, we introduce GW-FALCON, a novel feature-driven DL framework for early-time detection between GW signal+noise and noise-only data in next-generation detectors. Instead of feeding raw time series to CNN or more complex neural network architectures, we first extract a large set of statistical, temporal, and spectral quantities from short observational time windows using the TSFEL library. The resulting fixed-length feature vectors are then used as input to feed-forward ANNs suitable for low-latency operation. We demonstrate the method using simulated BNS and NSBH inspiral waveforms injected into colored Gaussian noise generated from the ET and CE design PSDs. We train separate ANNs on feature sets extracted from partial-inspiral windows characterized by different maximum instantaneous frequencies, enabling early-warning triggers from tens to hundreds of seconds before merger. Across all detector configurations and datasets, the resulting classifiers achieve high accuracy and detection efficiency, with ET-like networks typically reaching test accuracies of order 90% and CE-like ones exceeding 97% at low false-alarm probability. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first comprehensive feature-based DL detection framework for Next-generation GW observatories, connecting feature extraction from strain time series data to robust signal-noise classification within a setup that can be extended to real data and to more advanced neural network architectures.",

        "abstract": "Laser guide stars (LGSs) have been deployed for the last 20-30 years in ground-based astronomical telescopes to overcome the limited sky coverage of classical adaptive optics (AO) systems. Unfortunately, slow altitude drifts of the sodium layer compromise focus measurements, generating the so-called slow focus error, and, consequently, a natural guide star (NGS) is needed to compensate for that error. Our goal is to develop and operationalize a focal plane wavefront sensing (FPWFS) technique for slow focus tracking for the Keck I telescope, which can significantly increase sky coverage and allow slow focus tracking at higher frequencies, reducing the lag error. We develop, characterize, and compare three different FPWFS algorithms, namely Gerchberg-Saxton (GS), linearized focal plane technique (LiFT), and Gaussian fit (Gf). These algorithms were studied for the specific purpose of slow focus sensing in the NIR (H and K bands) using numerical simulations and data collected at Keck in 2025 (bench and on-sky). The three algorithms were studied and characterized against different criteria such as linearity, computational costs, and resistance to low signal-to-noise ratio and/or residuals. From the results obtained, the main candidate for an on-sky deployment was GS. On-sky tests showed promising results, with GS successfully compensating for purposely introduced focus errors, even under the presence of high turbulence conditions. This work can also be extrapolated to other existing 8-10 m class telescopes, or even future 30-40 m class telescopes, where the use of FPWFS can significantly improve sky coverage and reduce the lag error.",

Recent models of TDE disks show that they undergo brief thermal instabilities with temporal super-Eddington accretion at late times, which has been suggested as a possibility to explain the ubiquitous late radio emergence in TDEs. We model the ultraviolet (UV) and optical signatures of such disk instabilities, expected from the accretion power being reprocessed by the optically-thick outflow following super-Eddington accretion. Our model predicts brief UV-bright transients lasting for days, with luminosities of $10^{42}$-$10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in near-UV and $10^{41}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in optical for a typical TDE by a $10^6~M_\\odot$ black hole. These could be detectable by near-future surveys such as ULTRASAT, Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Argus Array, for TDEs of redshifts out to $\\approx 0.1$. We further conduct a search for these transients in existing nearby TDEs using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility, placing upper limits on the flare rate for each TDE of $1$-$2$ yr$^{-1}$ dependent on the outflow mass. In the era of future surveys, combined UV/optical and radio monitoring would be an important test to the disk instability phenomena, as well as its explanation for the late-time radio emission in TDEs.",

We combine measurements of the photospheric magnetic field from SDO/HMI and non-thermal velocity in log T~6.2 coronal plasma from Hinode/EIS for 28 active regions and find a moderate correlation between the two exists in quiescent active regions, consistent with the photospheric field injecting upward Poynting flux into the solar corona and causing coronal heating.

        "title": "A New Plotly-Dash-based Query Infrastructure for the Keck Observatory Archive",
        "abstract": "The Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) curates all observational data acquired at the W. M. Keck Observatory. The archive is expected to grow rapidly as complex new instruments are commissioned and as the expectations of archive users have expanded. In response, KOA has implemented a new Python-based, VO-compliant query infrastructure. This work is a continuation of the architectural design and technology selection identified at ADASS 2024. We have deployed real-time ingestion of newly acquired data and a dedicated interface for observers to manage these data. Our ADASS 2024 poster identified the new technologies chosen: Plotly-Dash, a low-code framework that exploits event-driven callbacks to simplify the handling of user interactions; R-tree spatial indexing to speed up spatial searches by x20; a VO-compliant TAP middleware, already in use at the NASA Exoplanet Archive and NEID archive; and mViewer, a visualization engine in the Montage Image Mosaic toolkit that is optimized for astronomy images.   These technologies will underpin new services that can be hosted on web pages or in Jupyter notebooks, and when completed, will replace the current query infrastructure. We have completed two new services now in beta release. The first is the Data Discovery Service, a web-based dashboard that returns spatial and temporal queries of the entire archive in seconds. It supports filtering observations by keywords, previewing results in an interactive data grid, and visualizing images, and it offers data downloads. The second is a Jupyter notebook that performs interactive visualization of Keck observations of protostars in the Rho Oph Dark Cloud and uses data from CDS and IRSA, as well as KOA.",

        "title": "Dust measurements with the Mars Dust Counter on board Nozomi (PLANET-B)",
        "abstract": "Nozomi was Japan's first space mission to Mars, launched on 3 July 1998 UT. It was equipped with the Mars Dust Counter (MDC) which was an impact ionisation dust detector. MDC detected 96 dust particle impacts when the spacecraft was in Earth orbit and later in interplanetary space, before its operation ended in April 2002 due to a technical failure on board. We compare the Nozomi dust measurements with the dust measurements obtained with the dust detector on board the Ulysses spacecraft. Impact speeds and masses of dust particles measured by Nozomi MDC are overall consistent with the measurements obtained by Ulysses in the same region of interplanetary space. Based on the impact speeds measured while Nozomi was in Earth orbit, MDC detected neither dust particles of natural origin that were bound to the Earth nor space debris. The dust impact rate measured in interplanetary space varied by approximately a factor of 2, consistent with theoretical predictions by the Interplanetary Meteoroid Engineering Model. The particle impact direction was concentrated towards the ecliptic plane, in agreement with an interplanetary origin of the majority of the measured dust particles. No impacts of cometary trail particles could positively be identified during known cometary trail crossings of Nozomi. The Nozomi dust data may become a valuable reference for the dust measurements to be obtained in the same region of interplanetary space with future space missions like, for example, MMX and DESTINY$^+$.",

        "title": "On the dynamics, thermodynamics and fine structure of virtual erupting filaments",
        "abstract": "It is not fully understood why some solar filaments erupt while others do not. Those that do typically undergo a slow rise followed by an acceleration phase, though this transition requires further investigation. Erupting prominences have been observed to heat up during the acceleration phase, but the origin of this heating remains unclear. Moreover, some coronal mass ejections possess additional fine structure in white-light observations beyond the classical three-part morphology. We aim to elaborate on the dynamics of erupting prominences, investigate the heating during the acceleration phase, and correlate our findings with observations. We employ the open-source MPI-AMRVAC code to solve the 2.5D MHD equations on a coronal domain extending to 300 Mm, using adaptive mesh refinement to attain high resolution. Controlled combinations of footpoint shearing and converging motions applied to an initial magnetic arcade produce erupting flux ropes with self-consistent prominence and coronal rain formation due to thermal instability. We find both non-erupting and erupting cases related to the system energization. Comparison with observations from the AIA Filament Eruption Catalog shows that the slow-rise and impulsive phases are modulated by magnetic reconnection. The transition to acceleration corresponds to an increase in the inflow Alfv\\'en Mach number. Thermal conduction and compressional heating can lead to prominence evaporation. We obtain nested circular fine structure in EUV images of the ejected flux ropes, partly resulting from plasmoid interactions. We conclude that internal heating processes and magnetic reconnection play key roles in the early evolution of CMEs.",

        "abstract": "One objective of Artemis science is to determine the impact human activities have on the lunar environment, which might compromise science objectives and measurements. We perform a preliminary analysis of the contamination associated with airlock venting and outgassing from a prototype lunar-module geometry intended to host astronauts on the lunar surface. The air flow generated by the depressurization of the airlock, expanding in the lunar exosphere, is studied using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for two different venting configurations and the particle flux on the surface is computed as a function of the distance from the the module. Outgassing from the main body of the module -- assumed to be covered with a Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) blanketing -- and from the solar panels is then analyzed using a view-factor method, employing outgassing rates from the literature.Our results give preliminary indications of the distance at which contamination levels fall below the values characteristic of native species in the lunar atmosphere. Scientific measurements targeting 40Ar should be carried farther than 30--100 meters from the module, while the detection of lower-abundance species such as polar-crater water might require to travel up to and beyond 3 km from the module.",

The dataset contains Surface Rainfall Intensity (SRI) observations from the Italian Civil Protection Department's national radar mosaic, harmonized into a coherent Analysis-Ready Cloud-Optimized (ARCO) Zarr datacube. The archive comprises over one million timesteps at temporal resolutions from 15 to 5 minutes, covering a $1200\\times1400$ kilometer domain at 1 kilometer spatial resolution, compressed from 7TB to 51GB on disk. We address the historical fragmentation of Italian radar data - previously scattered across heterogeneous formats (OPERA BUFR, HDF5, GeoTIFF) with varying spatial domains and projections - by reprocessing the entire record into a unified store. The dataset is accessible as a static versioned snapshot on Zenodo, via cloud-native access on the ECMWF European Weather Cloud, and as a continuously updated live version on the ArcoDataHub platform. This release fills a significant gap in European radar data availability, as Italy does not participate in the EUMETNET OPERA pan-European radar composite.

        "abstract": "We respond to the critique by Watters et al. (2026) of the statistical analyses in Villarroel et al. (2025) and Bruehl & Villarroel (2025). We argue that the critique conflates object-level validation with ensemble-level statistical inference and relies on a reduced, heterogeneously filtered subset originally constructed for a different scientific purpose. We further question whether the aggressively filtered subset used in Watters et al. (2026) demonstrates a meaningful improvement in sample purity, given the twenty-fold reduction in sample size. Our simple, visual check does not suggest that it does. The subset further lacks complete temporal information and is seriously statistically underpowered for testing the reported Earth-shadow deficit. We emphasise that the horizontal separation metric used for plate assignment and time reconstruction as in Watters et al. (2026) depends on the inclusion of the cos(Dec) factor to ensure geometric consistency. Any omission would alter plate assignment and inferred observation times. Moreover, the analyses presented in Watters et al. (2026) do not include uncertainty estimates or error propagation, limiting the interpretability of the claimed null results. We conclude that the principal findings reported in Villarroel et al. (2025) and Bruehl & Villarroel (2025) are not invalidated by the analyses presented in Watters et al. (2026).",

        "abstract": "We present a sample of 127 gas-bearing dwarf galaxies around 56 late-type host galaxies within 30 Mpc using 21-cm HI data from the WALLABY, MHONGOOSE, and ALFALFA surveys. We characterize the environment of each dwarf galaxy based on its host galaxy halo and derive optical properties using the DESI Legacy Surveys for 110. The gaseous satellites span $\\log (M_{\\rm HI}/M_{\\odot}) = 5.7-9.7$ and $\\log (M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot}) = 5.6-10.0$, with a median velocity line-width of $W_{50}=37$ km/s, comparable to the Local Group gaseous dwarf galaxies. We assess the HI mass sensitivity of the data by injecting model dwarf galaxies and find $M_{\\rm HI,lim} = 10^{6.7} M_{\\odot}$ for WALLABY and $M_{\\rm HI,lim} = 10^{5.4} M_{\\odot}$ for MHONGOOSE at 10 Mpc. With this sensitivity, our sample shows lower average gas-to-stellar mass ratios ($M_{\\rm HI}/M_{\\star}$) than literature dwarf galaxy samples. The abundance of gaseous satellites per host is low and increases with host mass: $0-2$ for isolated dwarf galaxy hosts and $0-5$ for Milky Way-mass spiral hosts. These numbers are consistent with the Milky Way, M31, and star-forming satellite abundances from recent deep optical surveys. The inferred quenched fractions and gas-depleted satellites indicate that environmental quenching is effective in Milky Way-mass hosts, likely driven by gas stripping processes.",

Our simulations show that dwarf galaxies initially form as compact galaxies ($R_e < 2$ kpc).

We find that the growth of rotation-supported stellar disks is the primary means by which isolated dwarfs become extended in size. These stellar disks are formed by mergers with high orbital angular momentum satellites on high angular momentum (spiraling-in) orbits, which spin up the gas surrounding the central galaxy and contribute $\\approx 30 \\%$ of the cold gas mass at $z=0$. For these systems, star formation in the angular momentum supported gas and the gradual build up of stars in the disk result in secular size growth.",

        "abstract": "Dark matter subhalos and satellite galaxies in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations still suffer from the ``overmerging'' problem, where inadequate force and/or mass resolution cause artificially enhanced tidal mass loss and premature disruption. Previous idealized simulations addressing this issue have been restricted to a small subset of the subhalo orbital parameter space, and all assumed subhalos to be isotropic. Here, we present the first extensive simulation suite that quantifies numerical convergence in the tidal evolution of anisotropic subhalos under varying numerical resolutions and orbits. We report a universal force resolution criterion: the subhalo's instantaneous tidal radius must always be resolved by at least 20 cells in adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)-based simulations, or by 20 softening lengths (Plummer equivalent) in tree-based simulations, regardless of refinement details or subhalo physical properties such as concentration or velocity anisotropy. We also report a universal expression for the discreteness-noise-driven scatter in the bound-mass fraction of subhalos that depends only on the subhalo mass resolution at infall and the instantaneous bound mass fraction, agnostic of any further subhalo properties. Such stochastic discreteness noise causes both premature disruption and, notably, spurious survival of poorly mass-resolved subhalos. We demonstrate that as many as 50 percent of all subhalos in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations are likely to be either force and/or mass unresolved. Our findings advocate for adaptive softening or grid refinement based on the instantaneous tidal radius of the subhalo.",

Traces of these accreted structures persist to the present day in the chemical and kinematic properties of stars and their orbits and allow for the disentangling of the accretion history of the Galaxy through observations of Milky Way stars.   We utilised 6D phase-space information in combination with [Fe/H] measurements to facilitate a clustering analysis of stars using their kinematics and chemistry simultaneously, a technique known as chemo-kinematic tagging. Using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE), we performed dimensionality reduction and identify stars from clusters and streams that are co-localised in the kinematic and chemical parameter space. We included E, Jr, Jz, Lz, r_apo, r_peri, and eccentricity as well as [Fe/H] as input into the algorithm, and used a sample of 5347 stars from 229 individual Milky Way substructures compiled from various sources in the literature.   Most notably, we recovered several large-scale structures that have been reported in the literature, including GSE, Thamnos, Sequoia, I'itoi, LMS-1/Wukong, Sagittarius, Kraken/Koala, the splashed disc, and a candidate structure recently found in another work. We find that 44\\% of Milky Way globular clusters are consistent with having an accreted origin. We also find that the chemo-dynamic properties of omega cen are consistent with a common accretion with the Thamnos structure. In addition, we identified many stream-progenitor associations, most notably a connection between the Orphan-Chenab stream and the Grus II ultra-faint dwarf galaxy, which supports previous findings that these two objects were brought into the Galaxy in the same accretion event.",

        "abstract": "The distribution of gas-phase metals within galaxies encodes the impact of stellar feedback on galactic evolution. At high-redshift, when galaxies are rapidly assembling, feedback-driven outflows and turbulence can strongly reshape radial metallicity gradients. In this work, we use the FIRE-2, SPICE, Thesan and Thesan Zoom cosmological simulations -- spanning a range of stellar feedback from bursty (time-variable) to smooth (steady) -- to investigate how these feedback modes shape gas-phase metallicity gradients at $3 10^{9}~{\\rm M_\\odot}$. These results demonstrate that bursty stellar feedback provides sufficient turbulence to prevent strong negative gradients from forming, while smooth stellar feedback does not generically allow for efficient radial redistribution of metals thereby keeping gradients steep. Finally, we compare with recent observations, finding that the majority -- but, notably, not all -- of the observed gradients may favor a bursty stellar feedback scenario. In all, these results highlight the utility of high-resolution observations of gas-phase metallicity at high-redshift as a key discriminator of these qualitatively different feedback types.",

Rapid cooling at these inner radii further implies that thermal pressure support is small, and the gas is dominated by the cool and warm ($\\sim10^4-10^5\\,{\\rm K}$) phases. Inner CGM energetics are thus dominated by turbulence, with gas density distributions and velocity structure functions similar to those seen in simulations of isothermal supersonic ISM turbulence, rather than those seen in subsonically turbulent stratified media such as the ICM. The gas accretion rate in these systems is regulated by the turbulence dissipation rate rather than by the cooling rate as in more massive halos. We argue that galaxy feedback is unlikely to qualitatively change our conclusions unless it continuously injects high specific energy material ($\\gg v^2_{\\rm vir}$) into the CGM. Such `turbulence-dominated' CGM can be identified in observations via the predicted wide lognormal ionization distributions and large velocity dispersions in UV absorption spectra, particularly in the inner CGM of $\\sim L^\\star$ and lower-mass halos.",

When observed at similar spatial and velocity resolutions, molecular clouds in the same mass range across these galaxies show broadly comparable physical properties and similar star formation rates (SFRs). However, this comparability depends on smoothing Milky Way clouds to match the resolution of the extragalactic observations. The beam effect can artificially inflate cloud sizes, leading to inaccurate estimates of radius, density, and virial parameters. By comparing high-resolution and smoothed Milky Way data, we established criteria to exclude beam-affected clouds in the extragalactic sample. After applying this filter, cloud properties remain consistent across galaxies, though some clouds in NGC 5236 show elevated velocity dispersions, likely due to environmental effects. In the inner Milky Way, molecular clouds fall into two groups: those with clumps and those without. Clump-associated clouds are more massive, denser, have higher velocity dispersions, lower virial parameters, and stronger 8~\\(\\mu\\)m emission, suggesting more intense feedback. Strong correlations are found between cloud mass and total clump mass, clump number, and the mass of the most massive clump. These results suggest that a cloud's physical conditions regulate its internal clump properties and, in turn, its star-forming potential.",

At the same time, both simulations and observations point to a widespread population of off-center intermediate-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies. Their ability to merge outside galactic centers may play a key role in shaping black hole mass assembly. Here, we investigate the dynamics of off-center black holes in dwarf galaxies hosting cored dark matter haloes, where long dynamical friction timescales and core stalling naturally arise. By embedding off-center black holes into an idealized galactic potential and scanning a wide range of orbital configurations, we assess the likelihood of close interactions through Jacobi capture. We find that captures occur in about 13% of cases. Such captures, possibly sustained within compact stellar systems like stripped nuclei or globular clusters, represent a crucial first step toward assembling massive black hole binaries beyond galactic centers.",

We introduce two complementary neighbor-search strategies, a standard k-d tree and a novel linked-cell grid, and demonstrate that jFoF attains up to an order-of-magnitude speedup compared to optimized CPU implementations while maintaining consistent halo catalogs. Beyond performance, jFoF enables gradient propagation through discrete halo-finding operations via both frozen-assignment and topological optimization modes. Using a topological optimization approach via a REINFORCE-style estimator, our approach allows smooth optimization of halo connectivity and membership, bridging continuous simulation fields with discrete structure catalogs. These capabilities make jFoF a foundation for differentiable inference, enabling end-to-end, gradient-based optimization of structure formation models within GPU-accelerated astrophysical pipelines.

        "abstract": "The distribution and the abundance of metals in the intergalactic medium (IGM) have strong implications on galaxy formation and evolution models. The ionic transitions of heavy elements in quasar spectra can probe both the mechanisms and the sources of chemical pollution, but high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra are required, as the IGM absorbers can be too weak for direct detection. In this work, we investigate the IGM metallicity, focusing on the detection of the weak absorption lines. We exploited the cosmological tool of the two-point correlation function (TPCF) and applied it to the transmitted flux in the CIV forest of the ultra-high S/N UVES spectrum of the quasar HE0940-1050 (z~3). We also \"deabsorbed\" the strongest circum-galactic medium (CGM) systems to reveal the underlying IGM signal. For each test, we generated 1000 mock spectra with shuffled line positions to derive an estimate for the TPCF noise level. The TPCF shows a clear peak at the characteristic velocity separation of the CIV doublet, but when deabsorbing the CGM contribution (i.e. all metal lines and CIV lines associated with logN(HI)>14.0), the peak is no longer significant at 1$\\sigma$, although 7 weak CIV systems remain visible. Even adding up to 135 additional weak mock CIV systems (logN(HI)<14.0) to the spectrum does not produce a significant CIV peak. Eventually, when we create a synthetic spectrum with gaussian distributed noise and same S/N as the complete spectrum, we remove the signal caused by the spectral intrinsic features and thus find a peak compatible with a metallicity of -3.80<[C/H]<-3.50. We conclude that the TPCF method is not sensitive to the presence of the weakest systems in the real spectrum, despite the extremely high S/N and high resolution of the data. However, the results of this statistical technique would possibly change when combining more than one line of sight.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel telescope concept based on Earth's gravitational lensing effect, optimized for the detection of distant dark matter sources, particularly axion-like particles (ALPs). When a unidirectional flux of dark matter passes through Earth at sufficiently high velocity, gravitational lensing can concentrate the flux at a distant focal region in space. Our method combines this lensing effect with stimulated backward reflection (SBR), arising from ALP decays that are induced by directing a coherent electromagnetic beam toward the focal point. The aim of this work is to numerically analyze the structure of the focal region and to develop a framework for estimating the sensitivity to ALP-photon coupling via this mechanism. Numerical calculations show that, assuming an average ALP velocity of 520,km/s -- as suggested by the observed stellar stream S1 -- the focal region extends from $9 \\times 10^9$,m to $1.4 \\times 10^{10}$,m, with peak density near $9.6 \\times 10^9$,m. For a conservative point-like ALP source located approximately 8,kpc from the solar system, based on the S1 stream, the estimated sensitivity in the eV mass range reaches $g/M = \\mathcal{O}(10^{-22}),\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. This concept thus opens a path toward a general-purpose, space-based ALP observatory that could, in principle, detect more distant sources -- well beyond $\\mathcal{O}(10),\\mathrm{kpc}$ -- provided that ALP-photon coupling is sufficiently strong, that is, $M \\ll M_\\mathrm{Planck}$.",

        "abstract": "Pre-explosion mass loss in supernova (SN) progenitors is a crucial unknown factor in stellar evolution, yet has been illuminated recently by the diverse zoo of interacting transients. We present SN2024cld, a transitional core-collapse SN at a distance of 39 Mpc, straddling the boundary between SN II and SN IIn, showing persistent interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) similar to H-rich SN1998S and PTF11iqb. The SN was discovered and classified just 12h post-explosion via the GOTO-FAST high-cadence program. Optical spectroscopy, photometry, and polarimetry over 220d chart the complex, long-lived interaction in this transient. Early evolution is dominated by CSM interaction, showing a 14d rise to a peak absolute magnitude of g=-17.6 mag, with clear flash-ionisation signatures. SN2024cld also shows a marked double-plateau light curve powered by CSM interaction, with high-velocity (6000 km/s) shoulders on a strong multi-component H-alpha profile. Dense polarimetric coverage reveals marked evolution in the photospheric geometry -- peaking at p=2% 10 days post-explosion, and rotating approx. 60 deg as the ejecta sweep more distant CSM. We observe a narrow 60 km/s H-alpha P Cygni feature throughout, associated with pre-shock CSM. SN2024cld represents among the best-observed 98S-like SNe to date, revealing a multi-component CSM structure: a dense, inner aspherical envelope, CSM disk/torus, and tenuous, extended wind. We propose this SN arose from an evolved supergiant progenitor experiencing multiple mass loss episodes in its terminal years, with binary interaction plausibly generating the CSM disk. SN2024cld constrains the progenitors and mass-loss paradigms of 98S-like SNe, unveiling the chaotic ends of evolved supergiant stars from afar.",

        "title": "Evolution of stellar magnetic activity: probing planet engulfment by red giants",
        "abstract": "The fraction of low-mass (LM) stars (M  1.5 Msun). One hypothesis is that LM red giants (RGs) engulf more planets than IM RGs, which results in a faster surface rotation and a higher magnetic activity. Indeed, LM stars reach a maximum radius at the RGB tip that is much larger than for IM stars, making them more likely to engulf planets. However, we need to study the evolution of the active star fraction along the RGB to firmly check this hypothesis. I use independent indicators tracing the activity level in the chromosphere based on the Ca II H&K, Halpha, Mg I and infrared Ca II spectral lines from LAMOST data for about 3000 RGs whose evolutionary stage has been identified by asteroseismology with the Kepler mission. I find that the fraction of active stars decreases for IM stars along the RGB but unexpectedly increases for LM stars. Such an increase is not explained by models of single-star evolution and is consistent with the fact that LM stars are more susceptible than IM stars of engulfing planets. Indeed, data shows that IM main-sequence stars exhibit a dearth of planets, consistently with predictions from planet formation theory. I also observe that the fraction of active stars tends to increase for both LM and IM stars on the HB, in partial contrast with previous findings. Finally, I discover that the IM RGB star KIC 9780154 may have engulfed one or more planet(s) as its surface rotation from photometry is twice faster than its envelope rotation from asteroseismology. Characterizing planet engulfment by RGs provides insights into the evolution and fate of most planetary systems, since about 97 % of stars pass through the RG evolution stage.",

One possibility is to use parametric fits calibrated against $N$-body simulations, that capture the cosmological parameter dependence of the halo mass function. Several studies have shown that this can be obtained through a calibration against haloes with spherical masses defined at the virial overdensity. In contrast, if different mass definitions are used for the HMF and the scaling relation, a mapping between them is required. Here, we investigate the impact of such a mapping on the cosmological parameter constraints inferred from galaxy cluster number counts. Using synthetic data from $N$-body simulations, we show that the standard approach, which relies on assuming a concentration-mass relation, can introduce significant systematic bias. In particular, depending on the mass definition and the relation assumed, this can lead to biased constraints at more than 2$\\sigma$ level. In contrast, we find that in all the cases we have considered, the mass conversion based on the halo sparsity statistics result in a systematic bias smaller than the statistical error.",

Prior to the arrival of MeerKAT, this intensity mapping technique had only been tested on a couple of pre-existing single-dish radio telescopes with a handful of observational hours with which to make early pioneering detections. The 64-dish MeerKAT array, precursor to the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO), can scan the sky in auto-correlation mode and perform intensity mapping across large sky areas, presenting the exciting potential for a wide-sky (${\\gtrsim}\\,10{,}000\\,{\\rm deg}^2$) spectroscopic survey across redshift $0.4\\,{<}\\,z\\,{<}\\,1.45$. Validating the auto-correlation (or single-dish) mode of observation for a multi-dish array and developing the analysis pipeline with which to make unbiased measurements has presented major challenges to this endeavour. In this work, we overview the advances in the field that have facilitated a robust analysis framework for single-dish intensity mapping, and review some results that showcase its success using early MeerKLASS surveys. We demonstrate our control of foreground cleaning, signal loss and map regridding to deliver detections of cosmological clustering within the intensity maps through cross-correlation power spectrum measurements with overlapping galaxy surveys.

The information about the density profile can be extracted from this quantity, which characterizes the type of condensate and, therefore, the corresponding DM property. This quantity allows us to probe the dark dense environment by multi-wavelength GW observation with existing ground-based and future space-based GW detectors, potentially reveals the properties of the dark sector and sheds light on the primordial origin of the stellar mass BHs.

We present here the first detailed theoretical study of the chemical evolution of fluorine at low metallicity by means of a stochastic chemical evolution model for the Galactic halo, in light of the most recent data for fluorine, which further pushed observations to lower metallicities down to [Fe/H]$\\sim$-4 dex, more than a factor of 10 lower in metallicity than previous detections. We employ a state-of-the-art stochastic chemical evolution model to follow the evolution in the Galactic halo, which has been shown to reproduce well the main observables in this Galactic component and the abundance patterns of CNO and neutron-capture elements, and we implement nucleosynthesis prescriptions for fluorine, focusing on the chemical evolution of this element. By comparing recent observations with model predictions, we confirm the importance of rotating massive stars at low metallicities to explain both the [F/Fe] vs [Fe/H] and [F/O] vs [O/H] diagrams. In particular, we showed that we can reach high [F/Fe]$\\sim$2 dex at [Fe/H]$\\sim$-4 dex, in agreement with recent observations at the lowest metallicity. With a stochastic chemical evolution model for the Galactic halo, we confirm the importance of rotating massive stars as fluorine producers, as hinted by previous studies using chemical evolution models for the Galactic disc. We also expect an important production of F at high redshift, in agreement with recent detections of supersolar N by JWST. Further data for fluorine at low metallicities and also at high redshift would be needed to put further constraints on the chemical evolution of fluorine and be compared to our theoretical predictions.",

        "abstract": "In the Milky Way disk there is a strong trend linking stellar age to surface element abundances. Here we explore this relationship with a dataset of 8,803 red-giant and red-clump stars with both asteroseismic data from NASA Kepler Mission and surface abundances from the SDSS-V MWM. We find, with a k-nearest-neighbors approach, that the [Mg/H] and [Fe/Mg] abundance ratios predict asteroseismic ages to an accuracy of about 2 Gyr for the majority of stars. That said, there are substantial outlier stars whose surface abundances do not match their asteroseismic ages. Because asteroseismic ages for these stars are fundamentally based on density or mass, these outliers are mass-transfer candidates. Stars whose surface abundances predict a younger age (higher mass) than what's seen in the asteroseismology are mass accretor candidates (MAC); stars whose abundances predict an older age (lower mass) than the asteroseismology age are mass donor candidates (MDC). We create precise control samples, matched according to (1) surface abundances and (2) asteroseismic ages, for both the MAC and MDC stars; we use these to find slight differences in rotational velocity, [C/N], and [Na/Mg] between the mass-transfer candidates and their abundance neighbors. We find no drastic differences in kinematics, orbital invariants, UV excess, or other stellar abundances between outliers and their abundance neighbors. We deliver 377 mass-transfer candidates for follow-up observations. This project implicitly suggests a fundamental limit on the reliability of asteroseismic ages, and supports existing evidence that age-abundance outliers are products of binary mass transfer.",

Magnetic and abundance maps of chemically peculiar (CP) stars, derived with the help of Zeeman Doppler mapping, have invariably been used as arguments against theories, in particular atomic diffusion theory. We intend to expose the fallacy of these claims.   Methods. We have identified in the literature those (5) CP stars for which multiple maps have been published, all based on the same Zeeman Doppler mapping strategy. For each of these stars we have then carried out inter comparisons between the recovered distributions of magnetic field and of abundances.   Results. Agreement between maps often turns out to be quite poor in regard to both abundances, field topology and absolute field strengths. Maps based on the same set of observations can differ considerably, even when they are coming from the same authors.   Conclusions. It becomes clear that Zeeman Doppler mapping cannot be guaranteed to yield unique results. When a number of physically impossible magnetic geometries all provide good fits to the observed Stokes $IQUV$ profiles, these solutions must necessarily be spurious and cannot be used as constraints to diffusion theory.",

We find a strong correlation between the He I D3 line intensity variation and the Sun's unsigned magnetic flux derived from SDO HMI data as well as with the solar RVs. Our results suggest that the He I D3 line offers a promising and straightforward proxy for magnetic activity, which may complement existing stellar activity indicators.

From approximately 120 candidates, we identify 12 objects with at least a prominent emission lines among \\Oii, \\Hb, \\Oiiia, \\Oiiib, and \\Ha that are spectroscopically confirmed by both instruments. Our key findings reveal systematic differences between the two spectrographs based on source morphology and shutter aperture placement. Compact objects show comparable or higher integrated flux in NIRSpec relative to NIRISS (within 1$\\sigma$ uncertainties), while extended sources consistently display higher flux in NIRISS measurements. This pattern reflects NIRSpec's optimal coverage for compact objects while potentially undersampling extended sources. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that NIRSpec recovers at least $63\\%$ of NIRISS-measured flux when the slit covers $>15\\%$ of the source or when $R_e<1$kpc. For lower coverage or larger effective radii, the recovered flux varies from $24\\%$ to $63\\%$. When studying the \\Ha/\\Oiiib emission line ratio, we observe that measurements from these different spectrographs can vary by up to $\\sim$0.3 dex, with significant implications for metallicity and star formation rate characterizations for individual galaxies. These results highlight the importance of considering instrumental effects when combining multi-instrument spectroscopic data and demonstrate that source morphology critically influences flux recovery between slit-based and slitless spectroscopic modes in JWST observations.",

Our determination of the distance to the system, 185.7 +/- 2.4 pc, agrees very well with the parallax distance of 185.39 +/- 0.39 pc from Gaia DR3.

Jet deceleration, which is often attributed to the entrainment of material, such as stellar winds, is thought to be necessary for efficient coupling. We present a simple model of jet deceleration due to stellar mass-loading to investigate the energy budget of direct jet feedback in the local Universe. To this end, we produce models of stellar mass-loss, including deriving a prescription for main sequence mass-loss rates as a function of stellar population age. We pair this mass-loss data with a parametric fit for radio AGN incidence, predicting that a majority of jets are decelerated within their hosts, and generally replicate the expected FR-II fraction in LERGs. We calculate that $\\gtrsim$25\\% of the jet power in the local Universe is efficiently decelerated and available for direct feedback within galaxies for any stellar population age. This fraction is largely invariant to the shape of the radio AGN incidence function at low jet Eddington fractions. The stellar mass-loss rate evolves significantly over time, approximately following $\\tau^{-1.1}$, leading to corresponding decreases in decelerated jet power in older stellar populations. Although asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars dominate mass-loss at all ages, we find that their stochasticity is important in low-mass galaxies, and derive a critical jet power below which main sequence stars alone are sufficient to decelerate the jet.",

The strong one corresponds to the standard adiabatic initial conditions, while the weak one is related to the strong via internal isocurvature fluctuations. We show that both types of adiabatic initial conditions are consistent with the separate universe approach, although the latter requires initial internal isocurvature.

Furthermore, this model can contribute to accounting for the lack of power anomaly in the low $l$ angular power spectra of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Using the latest data from the Planck (2018) collaboration, we establish observational constraints on the model parameters, which produce a characteristic low-$\\ell$ suppression in the cosmic microwave background spectrum.

The $E_G$ statistic is a discriminating tool for modified gravity theories, which leave imprints in lensing observables and peculiar velocities. Existing $E_G$ measurements rely on redshift space distortions (RSD) to infer the velocity field. Here, we employ kSZ velocity-reconstruction instead of RSD, a complementary technique that constrains the largest-scale modes better than the galaxy survey it uses. We construct a novel $\\widehat{V}_G$ estimator that involves a ratio between cross-correlations of a galaxy sample with a CMB convergence map and that with a 3D kSZ-reconstructed velocity field. We forecast for current and upcoming CMB maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Simons Observatory (SO), respectively, in combination with three spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We find cumulative detection significances in the range $S/N \\sim 20-55$, which can robustly test the scale-independent $E_G$ prediction under general relativity (GR) at different effective redshifts of the galaxy samples ($z\\approx 0.73, 1.33, 1.84$).

        "title": "A Decade of Solar High-Fidelity Spectroscopy and Precise Radial Velocities from HARPS-N",
        "abstract": "We recently released 10 years of HARPS-N solar telescope and the goal of this manuscript is to present the different optimisations made to the data reduction, to describe data curation, and to perform some analyses that demonstrate the extreme RV precision of those data.   By analysing all the HARPS-N wavelength solutions over 13 years, we bring to light instrumental systematics at the 1 m/s level. After correction, we demonstrate a peak-to-peak precision on the HARPS-N wavelength solution better than 0.75 m/s over 13 years. We then carefully curate the decade of HARPS-N re-reduced solar observations by rejecting 30% of the data affected either by clouds, bad atmospheric conditions or well-understood instrumental systematics. Finally, we correct the curated data for spurious sub-m/s RV effects caused by erroneous instrumental drift measurements and by changes in the spectral blaze function over time.   After curation and correction, a total of 109,466 HARPS-N solar spectra and respective RVs over a decade are available. The median photon-noise precision of the RV data is 0.28 m/s and, on daily timescales, the median RV rms is 0.49 m/s, similar to the level imposed by stellar granulation signals. On 10-year timescales, the large RV rms of 2.95 m/s results from the RV signature of the Sun's magnetic cycle. When modelling this long-term effect using the Magnesium II activity index, we demonstrate a long-term RV precision of 0.41 m/s. We also analysed contemporaneous HARPS-N and NEID solar RVs and found the data from both instruments to be of similar quality and precision, with an overall RV differece rms of 0.79 m/s.   This decade of high-cadence HARPS-N solar observations with short- and long-term precision below 1 m/s represents a crucial dataset to further understand stellar activity signals in solar-type stars , and to advance other science cases requiring such an extreme precision.",

        "abstract": "Photo-z algorithms that utilize SED template fitting have matured, and are widely adopted for use on high-redshift near-infrared data that provides a unique window into the early universe. Alternative photo-z methods have been developed, largely within the context of low-redshift optical surveys. Machine learning based approaches have gained footing in this regime, including those that utilize raw pixel information instead of aperture photometry. However, the efficacy of image-based algorithms on high-redshift, near-infrared data remains underexplored. Here, we test the performance of Detection, Instance Segmentation and Classification with Deep Learning (DeepDISC) on photometric redshift estimation with NIRCam images from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. DeepDISC is designed to produce probabilistic photometric redshift estimates directly from images, after detecting and deblending sources in a scene. Using NIRCam-only images and a compiled catalog of spectroscopic redshifts, we show that DeepDISC produces reliable photo-zs and uncertainties comparable to those estimated from template fitting using HST+JWST filters; DeepDISC even outperforms template fitting (lower scatter/fewer outliers) when the input photometric filters are matched. Compared with template fitting, DeepDISC does not require measured photometry from images, and can produce a catalog of 94000 photo-zs in ~4 minutes on a single NVIDIA A40 GPU. While current spectroscopic training samples are small and incomplete in color-magnitude space, this work demonstrates the potential of DeepDISC for increasingly larger image volumes and spectroscopic samples from ongoing and future programs. We discuss the impact of the training data on applications to broader samples and produce a catalog of photo-zs for all JADES DR2 photometric sources in the GOOD-S field, with quality flags indicating caveats.",

The launch of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) has opened a new window into the study of magnetic fields in SNRs through X-ray polarization measurements. For the first time, IXPE allows us to resolve the polarization degree (PD) and angle (PA) in the X-ray band across different areas of SNRs, offering direct insight into the geometry and coherence of magnetic fields on different scales. In this mini-review, I summarize the key observational results on SNRs obtained with IXPE over the past four years and discuss their implications for our understanding of magnetic turbulence in synchrotron-emitting regions.

        "abstract": "Cyclopentadiene (c-C5H6) is considered a key molecule in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar medium (ISM). The synthesis of PAHs from simpler precursors is known as the \"bottom-up\" theory, which, so far, has been dominated by reactions between organic radicals. However, this mechanism struggles to account for the origin of the smallest cycles themselves. Ion-molecule reactions emerge as promising alternative pathways to explain the formation of these molecules. In the present work, we investigate the reaction network of the main ionic precursor of cyclopentadiene c-C5H7+ . To this end, we establish an integrated protocol that combines astrochemical modelling to identify viable formation routes under cold interstellar medium conditions, automated reaction path search and kinetic simulations to obtain accurate descriptions of the reaction pathways and reliable rate constants. In particular, we examine the reaction between ethylene (C2H4) and the linear propargyl cation (CH2CCH+). Our results reveal that the formation of c-C5H7+ by radiative association turns out to be inefficient, contrary to our initial expectations. Instead, the system predominantly evolves through bimolecular channels yielding c-C5H5+ and CH3CCH2+ with the formation of c-C5H5+ offering new insights into reactivity that supports molecular growth in the ISM.",

        "abstract": "A systematic approach is presented for using CMB observables and reheating temperature for discriminating between various models of inflation and certain freeze-in dark matter scenarios. It is applied to several classes of $\\alpha$-attractor models as an illustrative example. In the first step, all independent parameters of the inflationary potential are expressed in terms of the CMB observables (the three parameters - by the scalar spectral index $n_s$, scalar amplitude $A_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio $r$). For a standard reheating mechanism characterized by the inflaton equation of state parameter $w$ and its effective dissipation rate $\\Gamma$ the reheating temperature is uniquely fixed in terms of the CMB observables measured for some pivot scale $k_*$. There are striking consequences of this fact. The model independent bounds on the reheating temperature, the BBN lower bound and the upper bound of the order of the GUT/Planck scale, translate themselves for each class of models into very narrow ranges of the allowed values of the spectral index $n_s(k_*)$, providing their strong tests by the present and future CMB data. The recent tension between Planck and DESI-ACT results has strong impact on our conclusions. Furthermore, given a class of inflaton models satisfying those tests, the reheating temperature is an interesting portal to link the CMB observables to the particle physics scenarios that are sensitive to it. As an example, non-thermal dark matter (DM) production mechanisms are discussed. One obtains then a consistency check between theories of inflation and DM production. If the future precision of the CMB data will constrain the reheating temperature beyond the model independent bounds, further constraints on the DM production will follow.",

Because the (u,v) coverage supports imaging, we introduce a statistical interferometric-imaging workflow based on MiRA to generate averaged images: this systematic approach enables the selection of an optimal set of reconstructions, improving the robustness and fidelity of the recovered features. We also use SPARCO, an independent tool well suited to bright central objects embedded in fainter extended emission. Images from both tools in the L, M, and N bands agree and reveal an asymmetric, elongated feature ~17 mas (~10 au at 631 pc) southeast of the star with ~20% density contrast. A second northwest asymmetry and a skewed inner rim are detected. Simple geometric modelling, guided by the MATISSE images, constrains the morphology, location, and flux of the CE and its asymmetries. The images are consistent with earlier VLTI measurements but expose a more complex CE with large-scale clumps in the southeast and northwest parts of the disc. Hydrodynamic modelling indicates that tidal spiral-wake perturbations from the central binary, dynamically excited at Lindblad resonances in the circumbinary disc, best explain the radial extent and curvature of the elongated structures seen in all bands.",

The well known co-evolution of supermassive black holes with their host galaxies suggests a constant connection between the small-scale (nuclear) and large-scale regions of galaxies. A fundamental component of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is the \"torus\", a dense, dusty structure that acts as the interface between the accretion disc and the ISM of the host galaxy. The transitional nature of the torus makes it a prime subject to search for evolution since cosmic noon. We use high-resolution near- and mid-IR imaging from the JWST CEERS program to disentangle the emission from the torus in unprecedented detail for 88 X-ray selected AGN at $z\\sim2$. We employ a novel SED fitting technique that combines archival low-resolution multi-band photometry at UV to FIR wavelengths with the new high-resolution JWST photometry to constrain essential AGN and torus parameters, such as accretion disc luminosity, torus opening angle, and inclination angle. We demonstrate that this SED fitting approach leads to better AGN characterisation and tighter constraints on AGN parameters. The population-level analysis finds that the Covering Fraction ($CF$) distribution peaks at $\\approx0.25$ with a long tail towards higher $CF$.

        "abstract": "The ability to disentangle the light of an AGN from its host galaxy is strongly dependent on the spatial resolution and depth of the imaging. As the capabilities of imaging systems improve with time, confirming that our standard techniques adequately model the increasingly complex structures unveiled is essential. With JWST providing unprecedented image quality, we can test how measurements of galaxy morphology vary with the choice of point-spread function (PSF) and fitting software. We perform two-component S\\'ersic+PSF fits of the surface brightness profiles of 87 X-ray AGNs $(0.1 < z < 4)$ from the CEERS survey. We create model PSFs for NIRCam F115W imaging using both photutils and PSFEx. We find that PSFEx models consistently fail to match the radial profile of typical point sources within our sample. We then perform AGN--host decompositions on each source by creating S\\'ersic+PSF models using both Galfit and AstroPhot. We find that Galfit and AstroPhot converge to different regions of the parameter space, providing consistently differing host galaxy properties. While we can measure the AGN and host magnitudes accurately, we find that the host galaxy morphological parameters are not well-determined -- the S\\'ersic index and effective radius are strongly covariant. Significant changes in the host galaxy parameters do not correspond to changes in the statistical quality of fit, nor to significant changes in the model's radial profile. These results indicate that the S\\'ersic profile does not uniquely well-represent typical AGN host galaxies in extragalactic survey fields. We also provide recommendations for studies of AGN hosts comparable to ours.",

        "abstract": "We present ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy of the 17 Myr, G0V star, HIP 67522. The UV spectrum is characterized by strong chromospheric and transition region emission lines. There was moderate spectral variability during the observations consisting of 15% stochastic fluctuation and two small flares releasing $E_{UV} \\simeq 2-4\\times10^{32}$ ergs in each event. We compare the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED; 4.7 A - 13.0~$\\mu$m) of the star first presented in Thao et al. (2024) to the solar SED and show that X-ray/UV (XUV) flux density at 1 AU is $10^{2}-10^{5}$ stronger (from 1000 A down to 5 A) in the young star compared to the present-day Sun. Attempts to reconstruct the intrinsic Ly-alpha emission of the star failed to return physically realistic results. The discrepancy appears to arise from a population of neutral hydrogen within the system itself, extending to $> \\pm500$ km/s. The absorption could be due to outflow from exoplanet atmospheric loss or from a stellar component; such a picture would require high spectral resolution observations and/or UV transit spectroscopy to confirm. Finally, we examine the evolution of the XUV emission from solar-type stars from ages of 17 Myr to 9.4 Gyr and derive a scaling relation between FUV Ly-alpha and EUV emission as a function of stellar age. X-ray (1--100 A) and EUV (100--900 A) contributions to high energy emission are 329 and 672 ergs/cm^2/s at 1 AU, respectively, suggesting that both may contribute to exoplanet heating at this epoch. The XUV emission levels at 17 Myr combined with the low density of the planet HIP67522b are consistent with models that predict that solar type stars born with high rotation and activity levels will drive substantial heating and escape on close-in, gaseous planets.",

        "abstract": "Thermal emission spectra provide key insights into the atmospheric composition and especially the temperature structure of an exoplanet. With broader wavelength coverage, sensitivity and higher resolution, JWST has enabled robust constraints on these properties, including detections of photochemical products. This advances the need for retrieval frameworks capable of navigating complex parameter spaces for accurate data interpretation. In this work, we introduce the emission retrieval module of NEXOTRANS, which employs both one- and two-stream radiative transfer approximations and leverages Bayesian and machine learning techniques for retrievals. It also incorporates approximate disequilibrium chemistry models to infer photochemical species like SO2. We applied NEXOTRANS to the JWST NIRCam and MIRI emission observations of WASP-69b, covering the 2-12 microns range. The retrievals place robust constraints on the volume mixing ratios (VMR) of H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, and potential SO2. The best-fit model, i.e, free chemistry combined with non-uniform aerosol coverage, yields a log(VMR) = -3.78 (+0.15/-0.17) for H2O and -5.77 (+0.09/-0.10) for CO2 which has a sharp absorption at 4.3 micron. The second best-fit model, the hybrid equilibrium chemistry (utilizing equilibrium chemistry-grids) combined with non-uniform aerosol yields a C/O of 0.42 (+0.17/-0.13) and a metallicity of log[M/H] = 1.24 (+0.17/-0.14), corresponding to approximately 17.38 times the solar value. This hybrid chemistry retrieval also constrain SO2 with a log(VMR) = -4.85 (+0.28/-0.29), indicating possible absorption features in the 7-8 microns range. These results highlight NEXOTRANS's capability to significantly advance JWST emission spectra interpretation, offering broader insights into exoplanetary atmospheres.",

Here we combine data-driven MHD simulations of NOAA AR 11158 (Fan et al., 2024) with flare-ribbon and coronal-dimming observations to investigate realistic coronal magnetic-field evolution during an X-class flare. We introduce L-maps, maps of the logarithm of magnetic field line lengths, as a diagnostic tool to track the dynamics of simulated coronal magnetic structures. Variations in L-maps identify flare ribbons through field-line shortening and coronal dimmings through field-line lengthening. Comparison with SDO/AIA observations demonstrates strong morphological and temporal agreement, validating the simulated field evolution. Applying K-means clustering to the L-map temporal profiles, we distinguish three stages of coronal evolution: (1) slow pre-flare rise phase, (2) flare reconnection accompanied by CME rise, and (3) post-reconnection CME expansion. We detect a slow pre-flare rise phase of magnetic field lines rooted in ribbon footpoints and identify a new phenomenon, reconnection dimming, a rapid expansion of reconnected inner flux-rope field lines during the impulsive phase. Our results show that L-maps provide a powerful and physically intuitive framework for bridging simulations and observations and for tracking the full three-dimensional evolution of coronal magnetic fields during flares.",

Radiative transfer calculations are an ideal candidate for machine learning emulation: fundamentally, it is a well-defined physical mapping from a static atmospheric profile to the resulting fluxes, and high-fidelity training data can be created from first principles calculations. We developed a radiative transfer emulator using an encoder-only transformer neural network architecture, trained on 1D profiles representative of solar-composition hot Jupiter atmospheres. Our emulator reproduced bolometric two-stream layer fluxes with mean test set errors of ~1% compared to the traditional method and achieved speedups of 100x.

        "abstract": "Poincar\\'e maps play a fundamental role in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory, offering a means to reduce the dimensionality of continuous dynamical systems by tracking the intersections of trajectories with lower-dimensional section surfaces. Traditional approaches typically rely on numerical integration and interpolation to detect these crossings, which can lead to inaccuracies and computational inefficiencies. This work presents a novel methodology for constructing Poincar\\'e maps based on the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC). The constrained functionals produced by TFC yield continuous and differentiable representations of system trajectories that exactly satisfy prescribed constraints. The computation of Poincar\\'e maps is formulated as either an initial value problem (IVP) or a boundary value problem (BVP). For IVPs, initial conditions are embedded into the functional, and the intersection time with a specified section surface is determined. We demonstrate linear convergence to the Taylor series, thereby enabling accurate interpolation without resorting to numerical integration or external optimization. For BVPs, periodicity conditions are encoded to identify periodic orbits in a Three-Body Problem context. Furthermore, by enforcing periodic constraints, we show how to construct first recurrence maps. The methodology is also extended to non-autonomous systems, demonstrated through applications to a Four-Body Problem. The proposed approach achieves machine-level accuracy with modest computational effort, eliminating the need for variable transformations or iterative integration schemes with adaptive step-sizing. The results illustrate that TFC offers a powerful and efficient alternative framework for constructing Poincar\\'e maps, computing periodic orbits, and analyzing complex dynamical systems, particularly in astrodynamical contexts.",

Testing its validity using independent astronomical probes remains crucial for understanding the global structure of the Universe. We investigate the angular distribution of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) using two of the most comprehensive all-sky datasets available, the BATSE (CGRO) and Fermi GBM catalog to test the isotropy of the GRB sky at large angular scales. We perform spherical harmonic decomposition of the GRB sky maps and estimate the dipole and quadrupole amplitudes. Statistical significance is evaluated by comparing the observed multipole amplitudes against distributions derived from 500 Monte Carlo realizations of isotropic skies. Our results show that the observed dipole amplitudes for both BATSE and Fermi GBM datasets lie within $1\\sigma$ region of their respective null distributions. However, the quadrupole amplitude in the raw BATSE and Fermi skies appears elevated at $3.7\\sigma$ and $3\\sigma$ respectively. After incorporating the BATSE sky exposure function, this apparent quadrupole anisotropy vanishes, indicating that instrumental non-uniformities fully account for the signal. Our method's reliability is validated through controlled simulations, which show it can detect the injected dipoles in BATSE-sized isotropic skies. These findings reinforce the statistical isotropy of the GRB sky and underscore the importance of accurate exposure corrections in cosmological anisotropy analyses.",

These bands exhibit consistent peak wavelengths and profiles in diverse sources, and ISO SWS and JWST spectra show a nearly identical red wing of the 3.3 mic AIB and blue wing of the 11.2 mic AIB in the dominant Class A sources. This spectral uniformity suggests that the AIBs arise from a small, well-defined set of gas phase PAH species, regardless of the excitation conditions or the nature of the source such as HII regions, reflection nebulae, planetary nebula, young stellar objects, or the diffuse interstellar medium. However, a small number of gas phase PAH species is inconsistent with current modeling of the AIBs that require a wide range of PAH types and sizes. It is also inconsistent with the lack of observed UV and optical absorption bands from gas phase PAH molecules. Furthermore, there is no plausible formation pathway to produce only a small number of specific PAH molecules in the interstellar medium. These issues require quantitative investigation in order to definitively establish gas-phase PAH molecules as the carrier of the AIBs.",

Its solid-phase pathways can lead to diverse conditions that can significantly influence its photostability and -chemistry. Laboratory studies have explored the effects of energetic processing on pure ethanol ices, there is a gap in understanding how ethanol behaves in astrophysically relevant mixed ices. This proof-of-principle study aims to quantify how the ice composition influences the photostability of ethanol mixed with CO, from both physical and chemical perspectives. It also seeks to highlight the importance of balancing constructive and destructive processes. Mixtures with ethanol to CO ratios ranging from 1:0 to 1:11 are exposed to UV irradiation from a microwave discharge H lamp under UHV conditions, at 16 K. The evolution of the solid phase is tracked using reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy, and changes in the gas phase are monitored with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Temperature-programmed desorption experiments aid in the identification of infrared spectral features. A radiative-transfer model has been developed to account for the influence of ice composition on the effective photon flux. The model reveals that, during later stages of irradiation, photoproducts play a significant role in the absorbing of incident photons, highlighting the complex cascade of processes initiated by single-photon absorption in ethanol-containing ices. By evaluating photodestruction cross sections as a function of the initial ice composition, we found that CO exerts a stabilizing effect on ethanol. For highly dilute ethanol:CO mixtures, representative of astronomical ices, the photodestruction cross section of ethanol is estimated to ~1.6E-17 cm2/photon after correcting for the effective absorbed UV fluence of the studied interstellar ice analogs.",

In this paper, we compare the roles of kink wave- and Alfv\\'en wave-driven heating in sustaining a region of the solar atmosphere, using newly developed physics and radiative cooling modules within MPI-AMRVAC. We extend the existing MHD physics module in MPI-AMRVAC by incorporating additional Alfv\\'en and kink wave energy contributions to the MHD equations. We examine their roles in heating the solar atmosphere and driving the solar wind. To validate our approach, we compare numerical results from Python-based simulations with those obtained using the UAWSoM module in MPI-AMRVAC. Furthermore, we assess the heating efficiency of kink waves relative to that of pure Alfv\\'en waves through two parameter studies: (1) exploring how different Alfv\\'en wave reflection rates impact the simulated atmosphere, and (2) varying the relative magnitudes of Alfv\\'en and kink wave energy injections. Finally, we present results from a larger-scale domain, sustained entirely by kink wave-driven heating. Our results show that kink wave-driven (UAWSoM) models are able to sustain a stable atmosphere without requiring any artificial background heating terms, unlike traditional Alfv\\'en-only models. We attribute this to the increased heating rate associated with kink waves compared with Alfv\\'en waves, given the same energy injection.

Through analysis of 21,540,921 fire detections spanning one year (January 2023 - January 2024), I demonstrate a complete absence of low-confidence classifications during nighttime observations. Of 6,007,831 nighttime fires, zero were classified as low confidence, compared to an expected 696,908 under statistical independence (chi-squared = 1,474,795, p < 10^-15, Z = -833). This pattern persists globally across all months, latitude bands, and both NOAA-20 and Suomi-NPP satellites. Machine learning reverse-engineering (88.9% accuracy), bootstrap simulation (1,000 iterations), and spatial-temporal analysis confirm this is an algorithmic constraint rather than a geophysical phenomenon.

        "title": "The Physical Origin of Periodic Density Structures in the Solar Wind: Coronal Streamers as Magnetohydrodynamic Resonators",
        "abstract": "We present a comprehensive physical model explaining the origin of Periodic Density Structures (PDS) observed in white-light coronagraphs with characteristic periods of approximately 45, 80, and 120 minutes. Through systematic investigation of potential resonant cavities in the solar atmosphere, we demonstrate that traditional large-scale cavities yield fundamentally incompatible periods: photosphere-transition region (3.3 minutes), transition region-sonic point (10.3 hours), and transition region-heliopause (7.7 years). We establish that coronal streamers act as natural magnetohydrodynamic resonators, with calculated harmonic periods of 122, 61, and 41 minutes that precisely match observations. The physical mechanism involves slow magnetoacoustic standing waves that create periodic density enhancements through wave compression, with the streamer resonator having quality factor Q ~ 10-100, enabling natural amplification of broadband coronal noise. At streamer cusps, these density enhancements trigger magnetic reconnection, releasing plasma blobs into the solar wind at resonant periods. The model provides complete energy budget calculations, wave amplitude estimates, and explains all key observational features including spatial localization, period coherence, and the relationship between remote sensing and in situ measurements. This work establishes streamer resonators as fundamental structures shaping solar wind variability and provides a new framework for understanding the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent astrophysical plasmas.",

        "title": "Revisiting the unification of tidal disruption events with polarimetry",
        "abstract": "Tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes produce multi-wavelength emission, of which the optical emission is of ambiguous origin. A unification scenario of tidal disruption events (TDEs) has been proposed to explain the different classes of X-ray and optically selected events by introducing a dependence on the viewing angle and geometry. This work aims to test the unification scenario among optically bright TDEs using polarimetry. By studying the optical linear polarisation of 19 TDEs (of which 9 newly analysed in this work), we place constraints on their photosphere geometry, inclination, and the emission process responsible for the optical radiation. We study how these properties correlate with the relative X-ray brightness. We find that 14/16 non-relativistic events can be accommodated by the unification model. Continuum polarisation levels of optical TDEs lie most often in the range P ~ 1-2% (13 events), and for all except one event, remain below 6%. For those optical TDEs that have multi-epoch polarimetry, the continuum polarisation decreases after peak light for 5/10 events, increases for 3/10 events, and stays nearly constant for 2/10 events. When observed after +70 days (7/16 events), they become consistent with P = 0% within uncertainties (5/7 events). This implies the photosphere geometries of TDEs are at least initially asymmetric and evolve rapidly which, if tracing the formation of the accretion disk, suggests efficient circularisation. The polarisation signatures of emission lines of 7 TDEs directly support a scenario in which optical light is reprocessed in an electron-scattering photosphere. [...] However, a subset of events deviates from the unification model to some extent, suggesting this model may not fully capture the diverse behaviour of TDEs. Multi-epoch polarimetry plays a key role in understanding the evolution and emission mechanisms of TDEs.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that mergers of a white dwarf (WD) with a neutron star (NS) or a stellar-mass black hole (BH) may be a potential progenitor channel for certain merger-kind, but long-duration $\\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs), e.g., GRBs 230307A and 211211A. The relatively large tidal disruption radius of the WD can result in non-negligible residual orbital eccentricity ($0 \\lesssim e \\lesssim 0.2$), causing episodic mass transfer, i.e., repeated tidal disruptions (RPDs) of the WD. We perform smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics simulations of RPDs in sixteen WD-BH/NS systems, capturing the subsequent mass transfer and accretion. The WD undergoes RPDs near the orbital periastron, modulating the ensuing accretion process, leading to variations of the accretion rate on the orbital period. Across all simulations, the peak accretion rates range from $4 \\times10^{-4}$ to 0.2 $M_{\\odot} \\rm \\ s^{-1}$, while the RPD duration spans from $\\sim$ 10 s to an hour. More compact systems, i.e., those with a higher mass ratio (higher WD mass and lower accretor mass), tend to undergo fewer RPD cycles, resulting in shorter durations and higher accretion rates. If such events can launch relativistic jets, three categories of non-thermal X/$\\gamma$-ray transients are predicted, in decreasing order of their mean accretion rates: (1) an X-ray transient with a simultaneous GRB, both lasting for $10^{1-2}$ s; (2) a longer X-ray transient lasting up to $10^{2-3}$ s that has a GRB appearing only at its later phase ; (3) an ultra-long X-ray transient lasting for $\\sim 10^{3}$ s without a GRB. A generic feature of these transients is that their prompt emission light curves are probably periodically modulated with periods of a few to tens of seconds.",

The system enhances quality control, predictive maintenance, and real-time anomaly detection for telescope operations. Methods: ServiMon integrates cloud-native technologies-including Prometheus, Grafana, Cassandra, Kafka, and InfluxDB-for telemetry collection and processing. It employs machine learning algorithms, notably Isolation Forest, to detect anomalies in Cassandra performance metrics. Key indicators such as read/write latency, throughput, and memory usage are continuously monitored, stored as time-series data, and preprocessed for feature engineering. Anomalies detected by the model are logged in InfluxDB v2 and accessed via Flux for real-time monitoring and visualization. Results: AI-based anomaly detection increases system resilience by identifying performance degradation at an early stage, minimizing downtime, and optimizing telescope operations. Additionally, ServiMon supports astrostatistical analysis by correlating telemetry with observational data, thus enhancing scientific data quality. AI-generated alerts also improve real-time monitoring, enabling proactive system management. Conclusion: ServiMon's scalable framework proves effective for predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring of astronomical infrastructures. By leveraging cloud and edge computing, it is adaptable to future large-scale experiments, optimizing both performance and cost. The combination of machine learning and big data analytics makes ServiMon a robust and flexible solution for modern and next-generation observational astronomy.",

Ten coatings were bonded to fused silica substrates and one remained on the epitaxial growth wafer. The average phase difference on reflection between beams polarized along the fast and slow axes of the coating was found to be $\\psi = 1.09 \\pm 0.18$~mrad, consistent with values observed in high-finesse optical reference cavities using similar AlGaAs coatings. Scans of substrate-transferred coatings with diameters between 18 and 194 millimeters showed birefringence non-uniformity at a median level of $0.1$~mrad. A similar epitaxial multilayer that was not substrate transferred, but remained on the growth wafer, had by far the least birefringence non-uniformity of all mirrors tested at $0.02$~mrad. On the other hand, the average birefringence of the epi-on-wafer coating and substrate-transferred coatings was indistinguishable. Excluding non-uniformity found at the location of crystal and bonding defects, we conclude that the observed non-uniformity was imparted during the substrate transfer process, likely during bonding. Quantifying the impact on the scatter loss in a LIGO-like interferometer, we find that birefringence non-uniformity at the levels seen here is unlikely to have a significant impact on performance. Nonetheless, future efforts will focus on improved process control to minimize and ultimately eliminate the observed non-uniformity.",

The results indicate that the polarity reversal occurs at the maximum of sunspot activity of each cycle, but the beginning, end, and duration of the reversals did not demonstrate any association with the Wolf numbers, which are characteristics of local magnetic fields. Moreover, during the periods of polarity reversal, the correlation between global magnetic field (GMF) parameters and Wolf numbers decreased and even moved into anti-correlation mode.   The polar field reversals are determined by the GMF flows of positive- and negative-polarity magnetic fields, which cyclically migrate from one pole to the opposite pole. The new polarity magnetic fields are delivered to the poles by a certain flow, and then carried away by the same flow to the opposite pole. The increase in the polar magnetic field strength to its maximal values at the solar activity minimum and following decrees to the next cycle maximum coincides with the latitudinal changes in corresponding magnetic field flow.   Formulas for calculating the meridional circulation of positive- and negative-polarity magnetic field flows were proposed. They allow predict the time of polarity reversals, and since polarity reversals occur at the maxima of cycles, then also the time of maxima of both the future and past cycles.",

        "abstract": "Flare ribbons with parallel and circular morphologies are typically associated with different magnetic reconnection models, and the simultaneous observation of both types in a single event remains rare. Using multi-wavelength observations from a tandem of instruments, we present an M8.2-class flare that occurred on 2023 September 20, which produced quasi-parallel and semi-circular ribbons. The complex evolution of the flare includes two distinct brightening episodes in the quasi-parallel ribbons, corresponding to the two major peaks in the hard X-ray (HXR) light curve. In contrast, the brightening of semi-circular ribbons temporally coincides with the local minimum between the two peaks. Using potential field extrapolation, we reconstruct an incomplete dome-like magnetic structure with a negative polarity embedded within the northwestern part of the semi-circular positive polarity. Consequently, the magnetic configuration comprises two sets of field lines with distinct magnetic connectivities. We suggest that the standard flare reconnection accounts for the two-stage brightening of quasi-parallel ribbons associated with the two HXR peaks. Between the two stages, this process is constrained by the interaction of eruptive structures with the dome. The interaction drives the quasi-separatrix layer reconnection, leading to the brightening of semi-circular ribbons. It also suppresses the standard flare reconnection, resulting in a delayed second HXR peak.",

        "abstract": "In many areas of astronomy, spectra of different objects are co-added or stacked to improve signal-to-noise and reveal population-level characteristics. As the number of exoplanets with measured transmission spectra grows, it becomes important to understand when stacking spectra from different exoplanets is appropriate and what stacked spectra represent physically. Stacking will be particularly valuable for long-period planets, where repeated observations of the same planet are time-consuming. Here, we show that stacked exoplanet transmission spectra are approximately mathematically equivalent to spectra generated from the geometric mean of each planet's abundance ratios. We test this by comparing stacked and geometric mean spectra across grids of forward models over JWST's NIRSpec/G395H wavelength range (2.8-5.2$\\mu$m). For two dominant species (e.g., H$_2$O and CO$_2$), the geometric mean accurately reflects the stacked spectrum if abundance ratios are self-similar across planets. Introducing a third species (e.g., CH$_4$) makes temperature a critical factor, with stacking becoming inappropriate across the CO/CH$_4$ boundary. Surface gravity exerts only a minor influence when stacking within comparable planetary regimes. We further assess the number of stacked, distinct sub-Neptunes with high-metallicity atmospheres and low-pressure cloud decks required to rule out a flat spectrum at $>5\\sigma$, as a function of both cloud deck pressure and per-planet spectral precision. These results provide guidance on when stacking is useful and on how to interpret stacked exoplanet spectra in the era of population studies of exoplanets.",

Based on sky observations during full Moon with FORS2 in imaging polarimetric mode, we measure the polarization degree and intensity at different wavelengths and scattering angles from the Moon, and compare them to theoretical and phenomenological single and multiple scattering models. Single scattering Rayleigh models are able to reproduce the wavelength dependence of the polarization as long as strong depolarization factors that increase with wavelength are introduced. Intensity data, however, require the inclusion of single Mie scattering from larger aerosol particles. The best models that simultaneously fit polarization and intensity data, are a combination of both single scattering processes, Rayleigh and Mie, plus an unpolarized multiple scattering component. Both Mie and multiple scattering become more dominant at longer wavelengths. Other factors like cloud depolarization and the sunlight contribution during the twilight were also investigated.

        "abstract": "High-sensitivity optical measurements such as those performed in interferometric gravitational wave detectors are prone to scattered light noise. To minimize it, optical components must meet tight requirements on surface roughness and bulk defects. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these measures can be undermined by other sources of scattered light. In this article, we examine scattered light noise caused by particles deposited on surfaces, especially on the baffles inside the vacuum pipes of the Einstein Telescope's interferometer arms. First, we study light scattering by particles deposited on a surface and having diameters from about one tenth to hundred times the light wavelength: we discuss its angular distribution and dependence on particle size and refractive index, and on polarization. Then, we specialize to the case of the Einstein Telescope arms and quantify the maximum allowed density of particles on each arm baffle. We conclude with cleanliness guidelines for the assembly of the vacuum pipes, including the required cleanliness class of the installation environment.",

        "title": "Observation and Modeling of Shear Evolution of Post-reconnection Flare Loops",
        "abstract": "A solar flare releases magnetic energy by reconnecting field lines across a current sheet, thereby allowing their relaxation to a lower energy state. The maximum possible energy is released if all field lines relax to a current-free (potential) state. The progress of a flare's reconnection is often measured as the angle-complement between the observed post-reconnection flare loops and the polarity inversion line of the photospheric magnetic field: shear angle. Many observations have shown strong-to-weak shear evolution over the course of a flare. A field line's shear angle is, however, an imperfect measure of its relaxation. We develop a new technique for observationally inferring the three-dimensional structure of post-reconnection field lines, including their local twist, $\\alpha$, which will vanish for potential fields. Our method fits loops in EUV images to extrapolations subject to constraints such as matching the feet of model field lines to observed flare ribbons. We apply the new method to an eruptive two-ribbon flare (SOL2014-12-18T22) which exhibits strong-to-weak shear-angle evolution. We find that, as the flare progresses, $\\alpha$ decreases in post reconnection loops anchored to newly brightened ribbons. Our study demonstrates that post-reconnection magnetic field is neither potential nor linear force-free. The method quantifies, for the first time, the time-history of a flare's energetic relaxation. It also quantifies the increasing height of subsequently reconnected field, and the time delay between reconnection forming a flare loop and its appearance in EUV passbands. These results promise to enable improvements in both magnetic modeling and hydrodynamic modeling of flares.",

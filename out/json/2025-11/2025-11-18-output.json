        "abstract": "We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of two idealized regimes of stellar convection: a cooling-driven model (Model C) and an entropy-gradient-driven model (Model S). The two regimes exhibit striking contrasts: while Model S develops large, relatively stationary eddies excited at depth, Model C is dominated near the surface by intermittent plume-like downflows that produce broad non-Gaussian velocity distributions and a turbulent energy flux that exceeds Model S by nearly an order of magnitude in the upper convection zone. Conventional gradient-diffusion (GD) closures reproduce the transport in Model S but significantly underestimate it in Model C, demonstrating that plume-driven convection lies beyond the scope of local, gradient-based models. To address this, we introduce a Time-Space Double Averaging (TSDA) method that extracts coherent fluctuations, yielding a diagnostic variable $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{u}}$ that peaks where the flux is largest. Building on this insight, we propose a modified GD closure in which the turbulent diffusivity is corrected by a plume-mediated term, achieving quantitative agreement with simulation results. Although the closure requires a calibrated model parameter and a careful choice of the averaging window, it provides a physically transparent framework that links coherent plume dynamics to mean-field transport, and offers a pathway toward improved subgrid models for non-equilibrium stellar convection zones.",

        "abstract": "We present a detailed kinematic and stellar population analysis of the inner disk of Malin 1, a giant low surface brightness (GLSB) galaxy with a prominent SB0-type central morphology. AstroSat far-UV imaging reveals clumpy emission features indicating recent star formation. Using MUSE integral field spectroscopy, we identify four star-forming complexes (SFCs) within the inner 10 kpc, each associated with localized ionized gas emission in distinct H$\\alpha$ velocity channels. Two of the SFCs, including a far-UV clump, appear on the blue-shifted side ($V_{H\\alpha}=-230~\\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$), while the other two are redshifted. The far-UV clump shows a strong velocity offset ($\\sim150~\\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$) and high gas dispersion ($\\sim250~\\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$), indicating that it is kinematically decoupled from the rotating disk. The spatial and velocity isolation of these features in the channel map confirms they do not follow regular disk rotation.   The far-UV clump hosts young (250-500 Myr), extremely metal-poor ([M/H]$\\simeq$ -1.69) and $\\alpha$-enriched ($[\\alpha/Fe] \\sim 0.5$) stellar populations, sharply contrasting with the surrounding super-solar gas-phase metallicity. The young stellar populations in each SFC are chemically distinct (similar to the far-UV clump) from the enriched central ISM, indicating rapid, local star formation from primitive gas before efficient mixing with the enriched ISM. Their spatial and velocity segregation, age synchronicity, and chemical homogeneity suggest an origin of gas delivered by a disrupted, gas-rich dwarf on a high-inclination (off-plane) orbit. These results suggest that the central HSB within $\\rm \\sim 9^{\\prime\\prime} (14\\ kpc)$ radius component of Malin 1 has grown through discrete, externally driven accretion, contributing to its complex, hybrid disk morphology.",

Although these effects have been observed in simulations, the conditions under which they arise remain unclear. Using high-resolution N-body simulations and analytic insights from kinetic theory, we systematically explore the physical origin of these effects. We demonstrate that the overall distribution function (DF) of the host, not just its central density gradient, determines the efficiency and direction of dynamical friction. Core stalling arises when the perturber encounters a plateau in the DF, either pre-existing or dynamically created through its own inspiral, while buoyancy emerges in systems whose DFs possess an inflection that drives an unstable dipole mode. We show that double power-law density profiles with rapid outer-to-inner slope transitions naturally produce such DF features, which is why structurally similar cores can yield radically different dynamical outcomes. Our results provide a unified framework linking the phase-space structure of galaxies to the fate of embedded massive objects, with direct implications for off-center AGN, the dynamics of nuclear star clusters, and the stalled coalescence of black holes in dwarf galaxies and massive ellipticals.",

Using the FLARES zoom resimulation strategy, we compare the EAGLE hydrodynamics model and the GALFORM, L-Galaxies, SC-SAM and SHARK semi-analytic models (SAMs) at $5\\leq z \\leq 12$. The first part of our analysis examines the stellar mass functions, stellar-to-halo mass relations, star formation rates, and supermassive black hole (SMBH) properties predicted by the different models. Comparisons are made with observations, where relevant. We find general agreement between the range of predicted and observed stellar mass functions. The model predictions differ considerably when it comes to SMBH properties, with GALFORM and SHARK predicting between 1.5-3 dex more massive SMBHs ($M_{\\rm BH}>10^6\\ {\\rm M_\\odot}$) than L-Galaxies and SC-SAM, depending on redshift. The second half of our analysis focuses on passive galaxies. We show that in L-Galaxies and SC-SAM, environmental quenching of satellites is the prevalent quenching mechanism, with active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback having little effect at the redshifts probed. On the other hand, $\\sim40\\%$ of passive galaxies predicted by GALFORM and SHARK are quenched by AGN feedback at $z=5$.

We use Stars and MUltiphase Gas in GaLaxiEs (SMUGGLE) to explicitly model the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) and employ sub-grid dynamical friction for massive black holes (BHs). Furthermore, we use a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve AGN feedback coupling to the ISM at $\\sim10-100\\,$pc scales. By comparison between merging and isolated galaxies, with and without AGN feedback, we identify trends in the complex interplay between dynamics, BH fueling and feedback, and star formation and feedback. We consider three galaxy types: Milky Way analogs, Sbc-type galaxies, and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) analogs. The synergy between AGN feedback and merger dynamics is strongest in the Milky Way-like mergers, where the AGN winds are energetically dominant and entrain more gas when the initially thin disks become thick and amorphous during the merger. In contrast, the merger of thicker, vigorously star-forming Sbc galaxies is not strongly impacted by AGN feedback until star formation declines in the post-merger phase. Finally, while the sub-grid dynamical friction prescription effectively retains BHs in galactic nuclei during more massive mergers, the clumpy multiphase ISM induces significant wandering of low-mass BHs $\\mathrm{(<10^5M_\\odot)}$ in the shallow potentials of the SMC-like galaxies. These low-mass BHs wander at distances $\\gtrsim 2$ kpc from the galactic center, yielding negligible BH accretion and feedback.

        "abstract": "With a sample of 552 galaxies at z~0.7 from the LEGA-C survey, we investigate how current star formation influences light-weighted mean stellar ages and metallicities, and their median trends with stellar mass or velocity dispersion. The bimodality in the global age-mass relation stems from the different age distributions in the quiescent (Q) and star-forming (SF) populations. A bimodality is not observed in the stellar metallicity-mass relation, although Q and SF galaxies have different distributions in this parameter space. We identify a high-metallicity sequence populated by both Q and weakly SF galaxies. At masses below logM/Msun=10.8 the median stellar metallicity-mass relation of SF galaxies steepens, as a consequence of increasing scatter toward lower stellar metallicities for galaxies with increasing specific star formation rate at fixed mass. With a consistent analysis of SDSS DR7 spectra, accounting for aperture corrections, we quantify the evolution of the stellar age and stellar metallicity scaling relations between z=0.7 and the present. We find negligible evolution in the stellar metallicity-mass relation of Q galaxies and for logM/Msun>11 galaxies in general. Lower mass SF galaxies, instead, have typically lower metallicities than their local counterparts, indicating significant enrichment since z~0.7 in the low-mass regime. The median of the stellar ages of both the general population and Q galaxies has changed by only 2 Gyr between z=0.7 and z=0.1, less than expected from cosmic aging. Some Q galaxies must evolve passively to reach the old boundary of the local population. However, in order to explain the evolution of the median trends, both individual evolution, through rejuvenation and/or minor merging impacting the outer galaxy regions, and population evolution, through quenching of massive, metal-rich star-forming galaxies, are required.

We revisit whether a top-heavy stellar initial mass function (IMF) in starbursts is required to reproduce both SMG observations and local galaxy properties. Using Bayesian optimisation, we perform an extensive search of the 15-dimensional parameter space of the GALFORM semi-analytical model. This efficient approach converges to optimal parameter values in fewer than 200 model evaluations, representing orders of magnitude fewer runs than traditional methods. We test whether GALFORM can simultaneously match three key observational constraints: the $z=0$ $K$-band luminosity function, the SMG number counts at 850~$\\mu$m, and the SMG redshift distribution. We consider two model variants: one with a universal solar neighbourhood IMF for all star formation, and another allowing the IMF slope in starbursts to vary as a free parameter. When assuming a universal Chabrier IMF, we find no parameter combination that simultaneously reproduces all three datasets. The model either matches the SMG constraints while grossly overpredicting the local $K$-band luminosity function, or matches the local luminosity function while severely underpredicting SMG counts by factors of 3--100. In contrast, allowing a top-heavy IMF in starbursts enables excellent simultaneous fits to all constraints. The best-fitting model prefers an IMF slope parameter $x \\approx 0.7$ (where d$n$/dlog$m \\propto m^{-x}$), somewhat more top-heavy than recent models but less extreme than early proposals. Our comprehensive parameter space exploration definitively confirms that, within the GALFORM framework, a top-heavy IMF in starbursts is necessary to reconcile high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies with local galaxy populations.",

We explore, in a systematic and data-driven way, the astrophysical conditions under which r-process enrichment can reproduce the observed trends of multiple neutron-capture elements in the Milky Way. Rather than assuming a fixed site, we adopt a flexible, parametric approach to test whether a common set of r-process parameters can explain the chemical evolution of several heavy elements. We compute a grid of one-infall, homogeneous models varying: Eu yield per event, r-process event rate, enrichment delay time, and progenitor mass range. For each of the $\\sim 1.5 \\times 10^5$ models, we predict [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trends by scaling Eu yields with the solar r-process pattern. A multi-objective optimisation based on Pareto fronts identifies models that best reproduce the abundance trends. Best-fitting models favour short delay times ($\\leq 30\\ \\rm Myr$), low-mass progenitors ($\\sim 20-25\\ \\rm M_\\odot$), and an effective Eu injection of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\rm M_\\odot$ per event.

While heavy elements can be reproduced, lighter ones show stronger conflicts with Eu, reflecting that the solar r-process scaling relation becomes less valid toward lighter elements. No single class of r-process events, under solar-scaled yields, can explain light and heavy neutron-capture elements; at least two components are required: a main r-process consistent with solar and r-rich stars, and a weaker component producing enhanced light r-process elements, similar to that observed in r-poor stars.",

        "abstract": "Globular clusters in the Galactic bulge are difficult to study due to high extinction and severe crowding. VVV-CL001 is an old, metal-poor, and fast cluster in the inner bulge, whose extreme properties make it a key probe of the early chemical and dynamical evolution of the Milky Way. We derive its fundamental parameters by combining spectroscopy, astrometry, and near-infrared photometry. Metallicity and radial velocity were measured from medium-resolution FORS2/VLT spectra; proper motions from Gaia DR3; and FourStar/Magellan photometry was used to refine the cluster centre, derive its structure, and estimate age, distance, and reddening. VVV-CL001 is confirmed to be an old ($12.1^{+1.0}_{-1.2}$ Gyr), metal-poor ($[\\text{Fe}/\\text{H}] = -2.25 \\pm 0.05$) cluster at a heliocentric distance of $7.1^{+1.3}_{-1.1}$ kpc, with reddening $E(J-K_s) = 1.40^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$. Its mean proper motions are $\\mu_\\alpha^* = -3.68 \\pm 0.09$ and $\\mu_\\delta = -1.76 \\pm 0.10$ mas yr$^{-1}$, and its radial velocity is $-334 \\pm 4$ km s$^{-1}$. The orbit is eccentric ($e = 0.76^{+0.10}_{-0.14}$), confined to the inner Galaxy ($|Z|_{\\max} \\approx 1$ kpc) and within the bar's influence ($R < 5$ kpc), with pericentre $0.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ kpc and apocentre $4.5^{+2.5}_{-1.2}$ kpc. Its old age, low metallicity, and orbital properties support an in-situ origin, identifying VVV-CL001 as one of the most metal-poor inner-Galaxy clusters formed in the early Milky Way. It likely belongs to the primordial disk cluster population later trapped by the bar, making it a fossil remnant of the earliest phases of Galactic assembly.",

        "abstract": "Though the nature of dark matter remains elusive, two models have come to prominence with testable predictions: cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). While CDM remains the widely accepted model, SIDM was introduced to potentially help resolve the discrepancies between the predictions of the CDM model and observational data, in particular the predicted central density profiles. Previous work involving simulations of small numbers of Milky Way-mass galaxies shows that SIDM delays massive black hole mergers as compared to CDM when the host halo has a flattened central density profile. It is, however, unclear how well massive black hole observations are able to differentiate between CDM and SIDM. In this work, we use mock gravitational wave observations of massive black hole mergers from LISA, a space-based gravitational wave observatory set to launch in the 2030s, to test LISA's capability to indirectly probe dark matter physics. As a proof of concept, we show that LISA may be able to distinguish between CDM and SIDM with a short-range interaction and a constant cross section of 1 $\\rm{cm^2~ g^{-1}}$ at the $\\sim2\\sigma$ level or greater, provided at least $\\sim80$ massive black hole mergers are observed with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 10. Our exploratory work shows that LISA may provide a pathway to probe dark matter self-interactions, motivating future work with more realistic, currently-favored models and larger simulation suites.",

        "abstract": "Type Ia supernovae are thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, yet the nature of their progenitor systems remains uncertain. Recent discoveries of hypervelocity stars provide unique constraints, as these stars likely represent the surviving companions of such explosions. Using detailed binary evolution models computed with MESA and population synthesis with MSE, we investigate the outcomes of hot subdwarf + white dwarf binaries undergoing helium accretion. We find that donors can nearly exhaust their helium and form compact, C/O cores before explosion. The predicted ejection velocities span a broad distribution reaching up to $\\sim 1000\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, with D6-2 representing the extreme high-velocity tail of this population. We estimate analytically that the thin residual helium envelope can be stripped by the supernova ejecta, producing a C/O-rich surface composition consistent with the observed spectrum. The Type Ia supernova rate from this channel is ${\\sim}(1.69\\pm0.06)\\times10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot^{-1}}$, consistent with 1% of the observed Type Ia supernova rate. Hot subdwarf + white dwarf binaries containing nearly exhausted He-star donors can therefore naturally explain the velocity and composition of D6-2 while providing a quantitatively consistent contribution to the observed Type Ia supernova rate. Our models predict a distribution of surviving donor remnants with various core He fractions and with ejection velocities extending down to $\\sim 450\\,\\mathrm{ km\\,s^{-1}}$. The orbital velocities of donor stars in this progenitor channel naturally yield orbital velocities consistent with US 708, LP 40-365 stars, and D6-2, indicating that a single class of thermonuclear supernova progenitors can account for their entire range of ejection velocities.",

The exquisite S/N reveals multiple high-ionization nebular lines and broad Balmer and [OIII] components (FWHM$\\sim700-3000$ km s$^{-1}$). We detect broadened HeII $\\lambda$1640 and $\\lambda$4687 (FWHM$\\sim530$ km s$^{-1}$) and strong NIII] $\\lambda$4642 emission consistent with a population of WN stars, making RXCJ2248 the most distant galaxy with confirmed WR features to date. We measure the multi-phase nebular density across five ions, the direct-method metallicity ($12+\\log(\\rm O/H)= 7.749\\pm0.023$), and a non-uniform elemental enrichment pattern of extreme N/O enhancement ($\\log(\\rm N/O)=-0.390\\pm0.035$ from N$^+$, N$^{+2}$, and N$^{+3}$) and suppressed C/O relative to empirical C/N trends. We show that this abundance pattern can be explained by enrichment from a dual-burst with a low WC/WN ratio, as expected at low metallicities. Crucially, these signatures can only arise during a brief, rare evolutionary window shortly after a burst ($\\sim3-6$ Myr), when WN stars dominate chemical feedback but before dilution by later yields (e.g., supernovae). The observed frequency of strong N emitters at high$-z$ implies a $\\sim50$ Myr burst duty cycle, suggesting that N/O outliers may represent a brief but ubiquitous phase in the evolution of highly star-forming early galaxies. The detection in RXCJ2248, therefore, provides the first direct evidence of WN-driven chemical enrichment in the early Universe and a novel timing argument for the bursty star formation cycles that shaped galaxies at cosmic dawn.",

The method self-consistently couples the ejecta circumstellar medium (CSM) shock dynamics to radiative diffusion from a moving heating boundary tied to the shocks, so that both the photon escape path and the effective diffusion time evolve with radius and time. We solve the mass and momentum equations for the forward and reverse shocks together with the diffusion equation in the unshocked CSM. TransFit-CSM reproduces the canonical sequence of an early dark phase, a diffusion-mediated rise and peak, and a post-interaction cooling tail, and it clarifies why Arnett-like peak scalings break down in optically thick CSM. The framework is well suited for Bayesian inference and constrains physical parameters of the ejecta and CSM from bolometric or joint multi-band light curves. Applications to SN 2006gy and SN 2010jl yield accurate fits and physically interpretable posteriors, highlighting the dominant role of pre-supernova mass loss in shaping the observables. Because it is both computationally efficient and physically grounded, TransFit-CSM bridges simple analytic prescriptions and radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, enabling population-level inference for current and future time-domain surveys.",

This multi-wavelength dataset combines optical emission line data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with X-ray fluxes from Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray space telescopes. Using diagnostic emission line ratios, we constructed Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams, introduced in 1981 to classify galaxies based on nuclear activity. Our analysis reveals that most red spirals exhibit AGN or low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) signatures, based on optical data, as determined by their location in the BPT, Cid Fernandes, and Mazzolari diagrams. These results are consistent with the presence of negative feedback from AGNs quenching star formation. Conversely, X-ray analysis reveals that many blue spirals exhibit high X-ray luminosities and are situated in the AGN region of emission line ratio diagrams, suggesting that AGN-driven positive feedback may be enhancing star formation. Our findings support the hypothesis that AGN feedback plays a key role in the evolution of spiral galaxies, particularly in quenching star formation and driving the transition from blue to red spiral systems.",

We use this sample of embedded cluster candidates to train multiple convolutional neural network models to carry out deep transfer learning-based searches for embedded clusters. With the aim of optimizing models for future catalog production, we compare results for four variations of training data using two neural networks.

However, the presence of bright foregrounds over four orders of magnitude stronger than the HI signal makes its extraction highly challenging. While all methods perform well when assuming a Gaussian beam degraded to the worst resolution, most of them degrade significantly in the presence of a more realistic beam model. In this work, we investigate the performance of SDecGMCA. This method extends DecGMCA to spherical data, combining sparse component separation with beam deconvolution. Our goal is to evaluate this method in comparison with established foreground removal techniques, assessing its ability to recover the cosmological HI signal from single-dish intensity mapping observations under varying beam conditions. We use simulated HI signal and foregrounds, covering the frequency ranges relevant to MeerKAT and SKA-Mid. The foreground removal techniques tested fall into two main categories: model-fitting methods (polynomial and parametric) and blind source separation methods (PCA, ICA, GMCA, and SDecGMCA). Their effectiveness is evaluated based on the recovery of the HI angular and frequency power spectra under progressively more realistic beam conditions. While all methods perform adequately under a uniform degraded beam, SDecGMCA remains robust when frequency-dependent beam distortions are introduced. In the oscillating beam case, SDecGMCA suppresses the spurious spectral peak at $k_\\nu \\sim 0.3$ and achieves $\\lesssim 5\\%$ accuracy at intermediate angular scales ($10 < \\ell < 200$), outperforming other methods. Beam inversion, however, remains intrinsically unstable beyond $\\ell \\sim 200$, setting a practical limit on the method.",

If confirmed at galaxy formation forbidden efficiencies, these galaxies could signal new physics beyond standard cosmological structure formation. We develop a galaxy model framework that ties the linear power spectrum to the inferred efficiencies of galaxy growth in order to test the structure formation models. In addition, we incorporate multiple sources of error, including (i) observational sample variance, (ii) asymmetric scatter induced by the steepness of the high-mass halo tail, and (iii) systematic uncertainties in stellar mass estimates. We find that the inferred efficiency of star formation is dominated by systematic uncertainties on the spectral energy distribution inferred stellar mass of the JWST detected galaxies. The systematic uncertainty augments the asymmetry in scatter that largely brings the inferred efficiencies to be in line with that expected from early galaxy formation models.

        "abstract": "Massive stars can exhibit giant eruptions with high mass loss shortly before their explosion as a core-collapse Supernova. These multiple giant eruptions (MGEs) may have a commutative effect that brings the star to a different state, possible one that favors the explosion. To address this problem, we evolve a 100 solar mass star and initiate a series of three giant eruptions lasting one year each, testing different mass loss rates and different metallicities. Following each eruption, we track the recovery phase to examine the post-eruption behavior of the star and its recovery timescale. The MGEs lead to a decrease in luminosity, accompanied by a slight increase in temperature. Later, during the recovery phases as the star starts to retain its equilibrium state, its luminosity increases. The recovery time-scale varies significantly after each eruption for independent on the mass loss rate, but it is shorter for lower metallicities. For the higher mass-loss rates during the recovery phase, the outer layers of the star exhibit oscillations and undergo compression at higher metallicity. These oscillations are most likely a consequence of thermal imbalance in the outer envelope. This behavior at higher mass-loss rates also suggests that the thermal readjustments during recovery may create favorable conditions for a subsequent eruption of the star.",

        "abstract": "Differences in metallicity between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) offer an opportunity to examine whether environmental metallicity affects the performance of machine learning models in classifying dusty stellar sources. The five stellar classes studied include young stellar objects (YSOs), red supergiants (RSGs), post-asymptotic giant branch stars (PAGBs), and oxygen- and carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars (OAGBs and CAGBs), which are key phases of stellar evolution involved in dust production. Using spectroscopically labeled data from the Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) project, we trained and evaluated a probabilistic random forest (PRF) classifier with four approaches: (1) separate training on LMC and SMC, including all five classes, (2) excluding the underpopulated PAGB class, (3) combined LMC and SMC datasets, and (4) cross-galaxy training and testing. The model achieved 93\\% accuracy on the SMC and 88\\% on the LMC across all five classes. In the SMC, PAGB sources were misclassified as YSOs, mainly because of their small sample size (4 objects). When PAGB was excluded, both the LMC and the SMC reached 92\\% accuracy. A combined dataset produced the same accuracy, and cross-galaxy training yielded similar results, indicating that metallicity does not significantly impact model performance. A comparison of absolute CMDs for the LMC and SMC confirms their similarity in stellar populations. These findings suggest that environmental metallicity has little effect on ML-based classification of dusty stellar sources, supporting the use of combined datasets and cross-galaxy models in low-metallicity environments.",

Two complementary estimators are employed: (i) a parametric approach fitting the power-law of the two-point angular correlation function, which yields the homogeneity scale $\\theta_H = 9.01_{-3.61}^{+8.43}\\;{\\rm deg}$; and (ii) a non-parametric fractal correlation dimension method, computing $\\mathcal{D}_2(\\theta)$ directly from the correlation function, which results in $\\theta_H = 6.28_{-4.43}^{+8.72}\\;{\\rm deg}$. From the mock catalogues generated with the GLASS algorithm, we find that the estimates from both methods are within $1 \\sigma$ of the median values obtained by applying both methodologies to the mocks. The transition scale to homogeneity, according to the $\\Lambda$CDM model, is defined for matter, i.e. $b = 1$. Measurements of this scale with observational data clearly depends on the cosmic tracer analysed, and a calibration is necessary. Our study with blue galaxies, with bias $b \\simeq 1$, provides a suitable estimate for comparison. Indeed, the results obtained in both approaches are compared with the value expected in the $\\Lambda$CDM model, obtaining a good concordance.",

        "abstract": "Research on young stellar populations is essential to understand the properties of embedded clusters and advance theories of their formation. This has driven advancements in methodologies for star detection, leading to the development of valuable databases and software. We present the scientific justification and operating principles of the IdentYS tool, which is designed to identify young stellar objects (YSOs) in star-forming regions. The tool facilitates the identification of young stars with infrared (IR) excess in remote and embedded star-forming regions, focusing primarily on Class I and II YSOs. For this purpose, near- and mid-IR photometric data and five colour-colour diagrams (J - H) vs. (H - K), K - [3.6] vs. [3.6] - [4.5], [3.6] - [4.5] vs. [5.8] - [8.0], [3.6] - [4.5] vs. [8.0] - [24], and [3.4] - [4.6] vs. [4.6] - [12] are used. The purity of the YSOs sample is enhanced by excluding field contamination from stellar and extragalactic objects. As a result, we compile a list of YSO candidates displaying the source designation, astrometric, and photometric parameters, as well as information on the evolutionary stage determined by the presence of IR excess, as indicated by certain diagrams. The application of this program can greatly streamline the statistical analysis of young stellar populations across diverse star-forming regions, including distant and deeply embedded ones, which typically require processing large volumes of initial data.",

        "abstract": "Gravitational waves (GWs) offer an alternative way to measure the Hubble parameter. The optimal technique, the ``bright siren'' approach, requires the identification of an electromagnetic counterpart. However, a significant fraction of gravitational waves signals will not have counterparts. Such events can still constrain the Hubble parameter $H_0$ via statistical methods, exploiting galaxy information from the GWs sky localisation volume. In this work, we investigate the power of this method using high-resolution, cosmological simulations that include realistic clustering. We find that clustering leads to increased convergence of the $H_0$ posteriors, with clear recovery of the input value as early as $N_{\\rm gw}=40$ events, compared to uniform catalogues, where the posterior remains largely unconstrained, even with $N_{\\rm gw}=100$ events. In addition, we quantify the role of catalogue incompleteness. We show that catalogues with completeness levels as low as $f=25\\%$ can be competitive with fully complete catalogues, confirming the impact of clustering. Completeness levels of $f=50\\%$ perform statistically similar to complete catalogues with as few as $N_{\\rm gw}=40$ events. This indicates the need to focus on improving gravitational waves detection capabilities, rather than obtaining more complete galaxy catalogues. Finally, we investigate additional properties of the method by taking into consideration physical weights, different observational errors, potential biases from the $H_0$ priors, a variety of detectors' horizon distances, and different methods of catalogue completion and statistical analysis.",

        "abstract": "We have carried out a detailed analysis of the 3.4 micron spectral feature arising from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH), using JWST archival data. For the first time in an external galaxy (NGC 6240), we have identified two distinct spectral components of the PAH 3.4 micron feature: a shorter wavelength component at 3.395 micron, which we attribute to short aliphatic chains tightly attached to the aromatic rings of the PAH molecules; and a longer wavelength feature at 3.405 microns that arises from longer, more fragile, aliphatic chains that are weakly attached to the parent PAH molecule. These longer chains are more easily destroyed by far-ultraviolet photons (>5eV) and PAH thermal emission only occurs where PAH molecules are shielded from more energetic photons by dense molecular gas. We see a very strong correlation in the morphology of the PAH 3.395 micron feature with the PAH 3.3 micron emission, the latter arising from robust aromatic PAH molecules. We also see an equally strong correlation between the PAH 3.405 micron morphology and the warm molecular gas, as traced by H2 vibrational lines. We show that the flux ratio PAH_3.395/PAH_3.405 < 0.3 corresponds strongly to regions where the PAH molecules are shielded by dense molecular gas, so that only modestly energetic UV photons penetrate to excite the PAHs. Our work shows that PAH 3.405 micron and PAH 3.395 micron emission features can provide robust diagnostics of the physical conditions of the interstellar medium in external galaxies, and can be used to quantify the energies of the photon field penetrating molecular clouds.",

The global neutral hydrogen fraction (x_HI) is a key observable for probing this era. This paper presents a novel, statistically robust method to extract the evolution of x_HI from the challenging noise-dominated data from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Data Challenge 3b. Our approach is based on a key physical insight: the pixel value distribution in SKA intensity maps is a mixture of signals from ionized and neutral regions. We model this distribution as a superposition of two Gaussian components-one fixed at zero representing noise and ionized bubbles, and a second, offset Gaussian tracing the neutral hydrogen signal. We perform this decomposition on data grouped into three redshift bins. The double-Gaussian model provides an excellent fit to the pixel histogram data. The derived x_HI values show a clear decreasing trend across the three redshift bins, consistent with a progressing reionization process. And the results are consistent with the provided simulation data. This method offers a powerful, model-independent, and fully interpretable way for measuring x_HI from 21 cm data, demonstrating significant potential for application to future SKA observations.",

We first experimentally validate the method on the MNIST dataset using possible alignment losses, including mean squared error and optimal transport, and subsequently apply it to large-scale maps of neutral hydrogen. Our results show that optimal transport is particularly effective at aligning OOD features when parity between ID and OOD samples is unknown, even with limited data-mimicking real-world conditions in extracting information from large-scale surveys.

NIRCam images and NIRSpec/IFU spectroscopy ($R=2700$) show that TGSSJ1530+1049 is part of one of the densest-known structures of continuum and line-emitting objects found at these redshifts. NIRCam images show a number of distinct continuum objects and evidence of interactions traced by diffuse emission, and the NIRSpec IFU cube reveals further strong line emitting regions. We identify six continuum and four additional strong Halpha emitting sources with weaker or no underlying continuum within the 3''x3'' IFU field. From spatial alignment with high-resolution radio data and emission line profiles, the radio AGN host galaxy is clearly identified. The bright Halpha emission (but not the optical components) is distributed remarkably linearly along the radio axis, suggestive of a biconical illumination zone by a central obscured AGN. The emission line kinematics indicate jet-gas interactions on scales of a few kpc. However, due to large relative velocities and presence of underlying continuum, the alignment with the radio structure appears to be, at least partly, caused by a particular configuration of interacting galaxies. At least four objects within a 10x10 (projected) kpc^2 area which includes the radio source have high stellar masses (log($M_\\star/M_\\odot)>10.3$) and star formation rates in the range 70-163 $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$.

The overall process deconvolves the observed image by the point spread function, de-lenses the image pixels, and uses interpolation or regression with smoothing to determine the model source. By working with de-lensed points, the method accounts for varying resolution across the source plane. We evaluate the speed and accuracy of different interpolation and regression methods using both mock data and real data for the giant arc in Abell 370.

        "abstract": "We present a detailed study of the 3D morphology of two extended associations of multiple protoclusters at $z=3.1$. These protocluster `complexes', designated COSMOS-z3.1-A and COSMOS-z3.1-C, are the most prominent overdensities of $z=3.1$ Ly$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) identified in the COSMOS field by the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey. These protocluster complexes have been followed up with extensive spectroscopy from Keck, Gemini, and DESI. Using a probabilistic method that combines photometrically selected and spectroscopically confirmed LAEs, we reconstruct the 3D structure of these complexes on scales of $\\approx$50 cMpc. We validate our reconstruction method using the IllustrisTNG300-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation and show that it consistently outperforms approaches relying solely on spectroscopic data. The resulting 3D maps reveal that both complexes are irregular and elongated along a single axis, emphasizing the impact of sightline on our perception of structure morphology. The complexes consist of multiple density peaks, ten in COSMOS-z3.1-A and four in COSMOS-z3.1-C. The former is confirmed to be a proto-supercluster, similar to {\\it Hyperion} at $z=2.4$ but observed at an even earlier epoch. Multiple `tails' connected to the cores of the density peaks are seen, likely representing cosmic filaments feeding into these extremely overdense regions. The 3D reconstructions further provide strong evidence that Ly$\\alpha$ blobs preferentially reside in the outskirts of the highest density regions. Descendant mass estimates of the density peaks suggest that COSMOS-z3.1-A and COSMOS-z3.1-C will evolve to become ultra-massive structures by $z=0$, with total masses $\\log(M/M_\\odot) \\gtrsim 15.3$, exceeding that of Coma.",

        "abstract": "The dynamic range of imaging detectors flown on-board X-ray observatories often only covers a limited flux range of extrasolar X-ray sources. The analysis of bright X-ray sources is complicated by so-called pile-up, which results from high incident photon flux. This nonlinear effect distorts the measured spectrum, resulting in biases in the inferred physical parameters, and can even lead to a complete signal loss in extreme cases. Piled-up data are commonly discarded due to resulting intractability of the likelihood. As a result, a large number of archival observations remain underexplored. We present a machine learning solution to this problem, using a simulation-based inference framework that allows us to estimate posterior distributions of physical source parameters from piled-up eROSITA data. We show that a normalizing flow produces better-constrained posterior densities than traditional mitigation techniques, as more data can be leveraged. We consider model- and calibration-dependent uncertainties and the applicability of such an algorithm to real data in the eROSITA archive.",

        "abstract": "Strongly lensed Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with an observable time delay can be used to constrain the expansion history of the Universe through time-delay cosmography (TDC). As the sample of time-delay lenses grows to statistical size, with $\\mathcal{O}$(1000) lensed AGN forecast to be observed by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), there is an emerging opportunity to use TDC as an independent probe of dark energy. To take advantage of this statistical sample, we implement a scalable hierarchical inference tool which computes the cosmological likelihood for hundreds of strong lenses simultaneously. With this new technique, we investigate the cosmological constraining power from a simulation of the full LSST sample. We start from individual lenses, and emulate the full joint hierarchical TDC analysis, including image-based modeling, time-delay measurement, velocity dispersion measurement, and external convergence prediction. We fully account for the mass-sheet and mass-anisotropy degeneracies. We assume a sample of 800 lenses, with varying levels of follow-up fidelity based on existing campaigns. With our baseline assumptions, within a flexible $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, we simultaneously forecast a $\\sim$2.5% constraint on H0 and a dark energy figure of merit (DE FOM) of 6.7. We show that by expanding the sample from 50 lenses to include an additional 750 lenses with plausible LSST time-delay measurements, we improve the forecasted DE FOM by nearly a factor of 3, demonstrating the value of incorporating this portion of the sample. We also investigate different follow-up campaign strategies, and find significant improvements in the DE FOM with additional stellar kinematics measurements and higher-precision time-delay measurements. We also demonstrate how the redshift configuration of time-delay lenses impacts constraining power in $w_0w_a$CDM.",

The SPS slopes of both the intensity and velocity fields exhibit a systematic scale dependence that approaches the values expected from turbulence models. Cloud-to-cloud VSFs follow similar trends to the pixel-by-pixel VSFs in the extended self-similarity (ESS) scaling, indicating that velocity differences among clouds arise from large-scale turbulent motions. Velocity- and intensity-increment maps reveal filamentary, intermittent structures. The PDFs of the velocity increments display strong non-Gaussianity and are well fitted by the normal inverse gaussian (NIG) distribution, whereas the intensity increments show much weaker tails.

About 80 SNe Ibn have been discovered to date, and only a handful have extensive observational records. Thus, many open questions regarding the progenitor system and the origin of the CSM remain. Here we investigate potential correlations between the spectral features of the prominent He I $\\lambda$5876 line and the optical and X-ray light curve properties of SNe Ibn. We compile the largest sample of 61 SNe Ibn to date, of which 24 SNe have photometric and spectroscopic data from the Young Supernova Experiment and 37 SNe have archival data sets. We fit 24 SNe Ibn with sufficient photometric coverage ($B$ to $z$ bands) using semi-analytical models from MOSFiT. We demonstrate that the light curves of SNe Ibn are more diverse than previous analyses suggest, with absolute $r$-band peak magnitudes of $-19.4\\pm0.6$~mag and rise (from $-10$ days to peak) and decay-rates (from peak to +10 days) of $-0.08\\pm0.06$ and $0.08\\pm0.03$ mag/day, respectively. We find that the majority of SNe Ibn in the sub-sample are consistent with a low-energy explosion ($<10^{51}$ erg) of a star with a compact envelope surrounded by $\\sim$0.1 M$_{\\odot}$ of helium-rich CSM. The inferred ejecta masses are small ($\\sim 1$ M$_{\\odot}$) and expand with a velocity of $\\sim$5000 km/s. Our spectroscopic analysis shows that the mean velocity of the narrow component of the He I lines, associated to the CSM, peaks at $\\sim1100$ km/s. The mean CSM and ejecta masses inferred for a sub-sample of SNe Ibn indicate that their progenitors are not massive ($\\sim10$ M$_{\\odot}$), single stars at the moment of explosion, but are likely binary systems. This agrees with the detection of potential companion stars of SNe Ibn progenitors, and the inferred CSM properties from stellar evolution models.",

Our study employs the massive early-type galaxies from the TNG100 simulation at redshifts z = 0.2, 0.5, and 0.7. Based on the simulated galaxies, we generate a self-consistent mock dataset containing both lensing and stellar kinematic observables. This is achieved through taking the potential composed of both dark matter and baryons of the simulated galaxies, plus the radial variation of the stellar orbit anisotropy depicted by a logistic function. By integrating constraints from both lensing and stellar kinematics, we separate the contributions of stars and dark matter inside the galaxies. Under three commonly adopted stellar anisotropy assumptions (isotropic orbits, constant anisotropy, and the Osipkov-Merritt profile), the model inferences suggest that the systematic biases in the total stellar mass and central dark matter fraction are not significant. Specifically, the total stellar mass on average is underestimated by less than $0.03\\pm0.10$ $\\rm dex$ while the dark matter fraction experiences only a statistically insignificant increase of less than $2\\%\\pm10\\%$ at the population level. The dark matter inner density slope in our tests is over-predicted by $0.15\\pm0.2$. Additionally, these lacks of significant biases are insensitive to the discrepancies between the assumed anisotropy in modeling and the ground truth orbital anisotropy of mock sample. Our results suggest that conventional assumptions regarding orbital anisotropy, such as an isotropic profile or the Osipkov-Merritt model, would not introduce a significant systematic bias when inferring galaxy mass density distribution at the population level.",

The explosions were modelled with a parametric treatment of neutrino heating to obtain defined energies, ${}^{56}$Ni yields, and neutron-star properties in agreement with previous results. Our 3D SN models were evolved from core bounce until 10 days to study how the large-scale mixing of chemical elements depends on the progenitor structure. Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (RTIs), which grow at the (C+O)/He and He/H interfaces and interact with the reverse shock forming after the SN shock has passed the He/H interface, play a crucial role in the outward mixing of ${}^{56}$Ni into the hydrogen envelope. We find most extreme ${}^{56}$Ni mixing and the highest maximum ${}^{56}$Ni velocities in lower-mass (LM) explosions despite lower explosion energies, and the weakest ${}^{56}$Ni mixing in the 3D explosions of the most massive RSGs. The efficiency of radial ${}^{56}$Ni mixing anti-correlates linearly with the helium-core mass and correlates positively with the magnitude of a local maximum of $\\rho r^3$ in the helium shell. This maximum causes shock deceleration and therefore facilitates high growth factors of RTI at the (C+O)/He interface in the LM explosions. Therefore fast-moving ${}^{56}$Ni created by the asymmetric neutrino-heating mechanism is carried into the ubiquitous RT-unstable region near the He/H interface and ultimately far into the envelopes of the exploding RSGs. Our correlations may aid improving mixing prescriptions in 1D SN models and deducing progenitor structures from observed SN properties.",

We present and analyse the detailed physical properties of six binary stellar systems, originally proposed as possible star-black hole binaries on the basis of radial velocities from Gaia's third data release, but soon recognised as likely post-mass-transfer binary systems with stripped companions. Methods. We used multi-epoch high-resolution FEROS spectra and spectral disentangling paired with stellar templates to derive effective temperatures, $T_\\mathrm{eff}$; stellar radii, R*; and projected rotational velocities, v$\\sin{i}$ for both components in all systems along with the mass ratio, q = $M_\\mathrm{accretor}/M_\\mathrm{donor}$ and the components' flux ratio as a function of wavelength. Results. Our analysis directly confirms that all systems are post-mass-transfer binaries with two luminous stars, i.e. no black hole companions. Each system contains an A-type accretor component that is rapidly rotating and a cooler very low-mass donor (~ 0.25M$\\odot$) that is overluminous. Five of the systems show no trace of any emission lines, implying that there is no current mass transfer, consistent with our inferred radii, in all cases within the Roche volume. The data are generally consistent with stable case AB mass transfer with $\\beta$ (the fraction of mass lost from the accretor) less than 0.7. While the accretor components rotate rapidly, they rotate well below the critical rotation rate, $v_\\mathrm{crit}$, even though there must have been enough mass transfer to spin them up to a significant fraction of $v_\\mathrm{crit}$, according to theoretical models of angular momentum transfer. As neither magnetic braking nor tidal synchronisation should have been effective in spinning down the stars, our results suggest that either mass accretion does not increase the angular momentum of the accretors to their critical values or the systems never reached these values in the first place.",

We find a clear positive correlation between the rotational velocity (v sin i) and color of eMSTO stars, supporting the role of stellar rotation and gravity darkening in causing the observed color spread. Contrary to predictions from binary tidal-locking scenarios, spatial distribution analysis reveals that fast-rotating stars are preferentially concentrated in the cluster's central regions. This finding provides the observational evidence favoring star-disk interactions during the pre-main-sequence phase, rather than tidal locking in binaries, as the primary mechanism responsible for the origin of rotational spread in eMSTO stars.",

We aim at providing new extinction estimates in the Gaia BP/RP bands to study the dust distribution in the disc, to provide new views of the spatial distribution of extinction and to compare it with tracers of the Galactic spiral arms. We use a highly homogeneous method based on the spectral chemo-physical parametrisation of stars from Gaia General Stellar Parametriser-Spectroscopy (GSP-Spec). This catalogue of 5.6 million stars in DR3, presents the advantage of estimating the stellar atmospheric parameters independently of extinction. The extinction is calculated by comparing the observed stellar (BP-RP) colours in the Gaia bands with the theoretical ones assuming a theoretical Teff-log(g)-[M/H] relation, from the GSP-Spec parameters. Publicly available, 3D high-resolution maps around the Sun are produced through the computation of differential extinction by discretising the dataset into spherical coordinates. Our large scale map covers a region of 4x4x0.8 kpc centred on the Sun with a discretisation of (dr,d{\\theta},d{\\phi})=(40pc,1{\\deg},1{\\deg}). To exploit the higher number of stars in the Sun proximity, we created a smaller scale map focused on the Local Bubble area, with a volume of 1x1x0.8 kpc and a finer discretisation of (dr,d{\\theta},d{\\phi})=(30pc,1{\\deg},1{\\deg}). The produced extinction maps exhibit a strong spatial correlation with molecular clouds and the spiral arms. Interestingly, several regions of the map are consistently present in different tracers as density of gas, of young stars and the chemical pattern of the spiral arms. Our study unveils the link between the distribution of dust, gas, and stars governing the chemical and dynamical evolution of the spiral arms in the Galactic framework.",

        "abstract": "Relativistic jets from supermassive black holes are expected to be magnetically launched and guided, with magnetic energy systematically converted to bulk kinetic energy throughout an extended acceleration-collimation zone (ACZ). A key prediction of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models is a transition from poloidally dominated fields near the engine to toroidally dominated fields downstream, yet direct tests within the ACZ are hampered by weak polarization and strong Faraday rotation. We report quasi-simultaneous, high-sensitivity, multifrequency very long baseline interferometric polarimetry of M87 spanning 1.4-24.4GHz. We present high-fidelity, Faraday rotation-corrected maps of intrinsic linear polarization that continuously resolve the ACZ in the de-projected distance range of ~9e3 to ~3.6e5 gravitational radii from the black hole. The maps reveal pronounced north-south asymmetries in fractional linear polarization and electric vector position angle (EVPA), peaking in the inner ACZ at a projected distance of ~20mas along the jet and remaining prominent out to ~100mas. These signatures are best reproduced by models with a large-scale, ordered helical field that retains a substantial poloidal component-contrary to the rapid toroidal dominance expected under steady, ideal MHD. This tension implies ongoing magnetic dissipation that limits toroidal buildup over the ACZ. The handedness of the helix provides an independent constraint on the black hole's spin direction, supporting a spin vector oriented away from the observer, consistent with the orientation inferred from horizon-scale imaging. Farther downstream, the asymmetries diminish, and the EVPA and fractional polarization distributions become more symmetric; we tentatively interpret this as evolution toward a more poloidally dominated configuration, while noting current sensitivity and dynamic-range limits.",

        "abstract": "MIRI is the imager and spectrograph covering wavelengths from $4.9$ to $27.9$ $\\mu$m onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) consists of four integral field units (IFU), each of which has three sub-channels. The twelve resulting spectral data cubes have different fields of view, spatial, and spectral resolutions. The wavelength range of each cube partially overlaps with the neighboring bands, and the overlap regions typically show flux mismatches which have to be corrected by spectral stitching methods. Stitching methods aim to produce a single data cube incorporating the data of the individual sub-channels, which requires matching the spatial resolution and the flux discrepancies. We present Haute Couture, a novel stitching algorithm which uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to perform a matrix completion, where the available MRS data cubes are treated as twelve sub-matrices of a larger incomplete matrix. Prior to matrix completion, we also introduce a novel pre-processing to homogenize the global intensities of the twelve cubes. Our pre-processing consists in jointly optimizing a set of global scale parameters that maximize the fit between the cubes where spectral overlap occurs. We apply our novel stitching method to JWST data obtained as part of the PDRs4All observing program of the Orion Bar, and produce a uniform cube reconstructed with the best spatial resolution over the full range of wavelengths.",

We aim to obtain an accurate reconstruction of the surface spot distribution on the young, rapidly rotating K2 star PW And by combining spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics. In particular, we seek to assess how the inclusion of continuous high-precision TESS photometry in parallel with high-resolution spectroscopy improves latitude recovery of starspots, especially at low latitudes and in the southern hemisphere, which are poorly constrained by Doppler imaging (DI) alone. We explore the spatial origins of the observed white-light flares. We performed simultaneous Doppler imaging and light curve inversion (DI+LCI) using contemporaneous high-resolution GAOES-RV spectra from the 3.8 m Seimei telescope (R~65000) and high-precision TESS light curves. Surface reconstructions employ the SpotDIPy code to model both line profiles and continuum brightness variations. We compare DI+LCI maps with DI-only solutions, conduct artificial-spot simulations to evaluate the effects of latitude, phase coverage, and S/N on reconstruction reliability. We also investigate the spatial correlation between the DI+LCI reconstructed map and flares detected in the TESS data. The DI+LCI reconstruction reveals significant spot features at mid-to-low latitudes, equatorial regions, and even in the southern hemisphere. Simulations show that DI+LCI provides more accurate reconstructions than DI-only, especially under conditions of incomplete phase coverage and low S/N, by better recovering both spot latitudes and filling factors. A comparison between the DI+LCI map and the TESS flare timings also suggests potential association between flare occurrence and reconstructed spot longitudes.",

        "abstract": "The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a next-generation Stage-IV facility renowned for its wide field of view, high image quality, and multi-band observational capabilities. Among the five instruments onboard the CSST, the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) offers the unique ability to simultaneously capture spatial and spectral information across a field of view of no less than $6^{''}\\times6^{''}$. Key advantages of the IFS include a high spatial resolution of $0.2^{''}$ and a broad spectral coverage from 350 to 1000 nm, making it an ideal instrument for studying physical processes in the vicinity of supermassive black holes within galaxies. To more accurately assess the technical and scientific performance of the CSST-IFS, it is essential to develop a simulation tool that incorporates realistic effects from all optical components. Such a simulation will form an integral part of the CSST-IFS data and pipeline system, enabling the development of the data reduction pipeline well ahead of actual observations. This paper presents an end-to-end simulation workflow for the CSST-IFS, incorporating a wide range of instrumental effects that may influence its spectral and imaging performance. The simulation accounts for optical diffraction effects introduced by all components, such as image slicers and slit array, as well as sub-pixel effects from gratings. It also includes various detector noises, frame-shifting effects, and charge-transfer inefficiency. Real observational conditions--such as target Doppler shift, cosmic rays, and other in-orbit operational effects--are also considered. We describe the technical implementation of the simulation and present results that quantitatively characterize key instrument parameters.",

        "abstract": "Neutrinos produced in core-collapse supernova offer a direct probe into the hydrodynamics and energy transport mechanisms during the collapse and play a pivotal role in the shock revival and success of the supernova explosion. Fast-time features of the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum encode information about phenomena such as turbulence, convection, shock revival and potential quark-hadron phase transitions. In this study, we explore the detection capabilities of large-volume neutrino telescopes with a focus on IceCube and the planned extension IceCube-Gen2. Furthermore, we consider the effect on the detection sensitivity from wavelength shifters through enhanced light collection.   A variety of models predict periodic fast-time features in supernova light curves; to quantify their detectability without relying on specific models, we investigate the detector response to a generic parameterisation of such features. We find that independent of feature frequency, IceCube-Gen2 instrumented with wavelength shifters has sensitivity to weaker modulations ($>25\\%$ amplitude) as compared to only the strongest modulations ($>50\\%$ amplitude) with IceCube. In addition, we examine the sensitivity of the neutrino lightcurve to sharp features from a quark-hadron phase transition. Phase transitions leading to a quark star remnant are detectable with IceCube at $5\\sigma$ up to the edge of the Galaxy, and throughout the Small Magellanic Cloud with IceCube-Gen2 equipped with wavelength-shifters. In contrast, models collapsing into a black hole are observable only within the Galaxy, covering $41\\%$ of the CCSNe population for IceCube and nearly all ($91\\%$) for IceCube-Gen2 complemented by wavelength shifters. These results highlight the potential of IceCube-Gen2 for detecting Galactic sources more reliably and with greater reach.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is one of the key ingredients for life, yet its origins in galaxies remain poorly understood. In order to investigate the production of P by supernovae, we performed near-infrared (IR) [P II] and [Fe II] line mapping of 26 Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) with the Infrared Survey Facility and Kanata telescopes, using the narrow-band filters tuned to these lines. By combining our data with archival [Fe II] maps from UKIRT, we detected both the [P II] and [Fe II] emissions in five SNRs, only the [Fe II] emission in 15 SNRs, and no line emissions in the remaining six. Using the observed [P II]/[Fe II] ratios and upper limits for non-detections, we derived the P/Fe abundance ratios, which vary by up to two orders of magnitude among our sample SNRs. This suggests that the production rate of P and/or the degree of dust destruction may differ from remnant to remnant, the latter being due to the fact that P is volatile while Fe is mostly locked in dust grains. We used the mid- and far-IR maps to examine the dust content for the five SNRs where both the line emissions are detected. As a result, we find that high P/Fe abundance ratios in the northern and southeastern regions of Cassiopeia A and the Crab Nebula, respectively, are not likely due to dust destruction but may reflect an asymmetric ejection of P during supernova explosions. In the Crab Nebula, it is also possible that near-IR [Ni II] emission contaminates the observed flux in the southeastern region, suggesting that the Ni/Fe abundance ratio, rather than the P/Fe abundance ratio, is relatively high in this part of the remnant.",

Diagnostic classification via the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram indicates that the sample comprises 12 AGNs, 12 composite galaxies, 3 H{\\sc ii} galaxies, and 1 object of uncertain classification. A strong correlation is found between stellar mass and velocity dispersion. We examine the asymmetries of the narrow H$\\beta$ and find that the correlation between velocity offset and narrow H$\\beta$ skewness is negligible in both blue-shifted and red-shifted systems, suggesting that the rotating disk model may not fully explain the observed kinematics. The sample exhibits an asymmetric velocity offset distribution, with more red-shifted (17) than blue-shifted (11) objects. No significant correlation is observed between velocity offset and line width in blue-shifted systems, while red-shifted systems show a weak anti-correlation for narrow H$\\alpha$, which is inconsistent with the outflow model. The similarity in velocity offset between narrow emission lines supports the dual core system. Furthermore, the SDSS photometric images reveal eight objects with two cores and two with merger features. Based on the narrow emission line properties, the objects in our sample represent strong candidates for dual core systems exhibiting velocity offset. Extending this property to higher-redshift populations in the near future may facilitate the identification of merging supermassive black hole pairs at earlier cosmic epochs, providing critical constraints on their formation and evolution.",

Each rate coefficient has an associated uncertainty, which is generally not taken into account when calculating the chemistry. We performed the first uncertainty analysis of a chemical model of C-rich and O-rich AGB outflows using the Rate22 reaction network. Quantifying the error on the model predictions enables us to determine the need for adding complexity to the model. Using a Monte Carlo sampling method, we quantified the impact of the uncertainties on the chemical kinetic data on the predicted fractional abundances and column densities. The errors are caused by a complex interplay of reactions forming and destroying each species. Parent species show an error on their envelope sizes, which is not caused by the uncertainty on their photodissociation rate, but rather the chemistry reforming the parent after its photodissociation. Using photodissociation models to estimate the envelope size might be an oversimplification. The error on the CO envelope impacts retrieved mass-loss rates by up to a factor of two. For daughter species, the error on the peak fractional abundance ranges from a factor of a few to three orders of magnitude, and is on average about 10\\% of its value. This error is positively correlated with the error on the column density. The standard model suffices for many species, e.g., the radial distribution of cyanopolyynes and hydrocarbon radicals around IRC +10216. However, including spherical asymmetries, dust-gas chemistry, and photochemistry induced by a close-by stellar companion are still necessary to explain certain observations.",

Most models rely on analytical formulae for the disk mass and dynamical ejecta that are fitted to the results of numerical simulations, yet these fits have large uncertainties that significantly limit our ability to extract information from merger observations. In a recent manuscript, Darc et al claim that disk mass formulae constructed using symbolic regression outperform existing formulae and robustly extend to regions of the parameter space outside of the fitting region. I show here that the improvement over the most directly comparable existing model comes mostly from the use of different error measures in optimizing the fitting parameters. For the limited training data used so far, that existing fitting formula has a performance similar to symbolic regression models when optimized over the same error measure. More importantly, I show that many of the formulae obtained through symbolic regression provide unphysical results when used over the whole range of parameters relevant to the modeling of binary neutron star mergers, making them dangerous to use within parameter estimation pipelines. I conclude that fitting formulae with more physics input (e.g. Lund et al 2025), albeit certainly imperfect, remain safer to use in data analysis than these symbolic regression results. Symbolic regression results used in conjunction with careful physics-based vetting may however outperform them in the future.",

Follow-up observations from $\\sim$1.5 to 100 days post-trigger were obtained across X-ray, UV, optical, near-infrared, and radio bands with ground- and space-based facilities. The redshift is constrained to $z = 0.7485$ from prominent optical spectral features. The optical light curve shows complex evolution: an initial $\\sim t^{-0.7}$ decay, followed by a rapid re-brightening peaking at day 7.7 with $\\sim t^{-1.7}$ decay, and a third phase peaking near day 19 with $\\sim t^{-1.3}$ decay.

Although broad-lined absorption features are absent, comparisons with type Ic-BL supernovae suggest a SN contribution at late times, suggesting a collapsar origin for EP 241021a. The likely SN in EP 241021a appears to require an additional energy source beyond $^{56}$Ni decay.

        "abstract": "Hills breakup of binary systems allows massive black holes (MBH) to produce hyper-velocity stars (HVSs) and tightly bound stars. The long timescale of orbital relaxation means that binaries must spend numerous orbits around the MBH before they are tidally broken apart. Repeated MBH tidal perturbations over multiple pericenter passages can perturb the binary inner orbit to high eccentricities, leading to strong tidal interactions between the stars. In this work, we develop a physical model of the MBH-binary system, taking into account outer orbital relaxation, MBH tidal perturbations, and tidal interactions between the binaries in the form of dynamical tides. We show that when the inner orbit reaches high eccentricities such that the pericenter radius is only a few times stellar radii ($R_*$), the stellar oscillation modes can grow chaotically and rapidly harden the binaries to semi-major axes $a_b\\lesssim 10\\,R_*$. We find that a significant fraction (up to 50\\%) of initially wide binaries that are in the empty loss-cone regime ($a_b\\sim 1.0\\,{\\rm AU}$) do not undergo Hills breakup as wide binaries, but instead experience chaotic growth of tides and become close binaries. These tidally hardened binaries provide a new channel for the production of the fastest HVSs, and are connected to other nuclear transients such as repeating partial tidal disruption events and quasi-periodic eruptions.",

We constructed a sophisticated three-dimensional radiative transfer model of the AGN source and dusty torus, built upon a physically motivated framework that includes a comprehensive dust grain model. To investigate the properties of the circumnuclear medium, we performed model fitting to a sample of 20 observational spectra from Spitzer Space Telescope's IRS Enhanced Data Products, testing two distinct dust density laws: a steep $r^{-2}$ profile, characteristic of a radiation pressure-driven wind, and a shallower $r^{-1}$ profile, which is a key prediction of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. Our model successfully reproduces fundamental observational phenomena, such as the transition from 9.7\\,$\\mu$m silicate emission at low inclinations to deep absorption at high inclinations, with absorption features becoming more pronounced for higher accretion rates, dust-to-gas ratios, and black hole masses. Most importantly, a direct comparison of the fitting results revealed that the $r^{-1}$ density law provided a significantly better fit ($\\chi^2$) than the $r^{-2}$ density law for 18 of the 20 observational spectra. These results confirm the physical consistency of our advanced radiative model and provide compelling evidence that an $r^{-1}$ density law is a more accurate representation of the AGN dusty torus.",

TGSSJ1530+1049 was selected as a candidate high-redshift radio galaxy. Subsequent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) presented in a companion paper (Saxena et al., submitted) have shown that it is located at a redshift z=4.0. The JWST data furthermore showed that the radio source is part of one of the densest structures of galaxies and ionized gas known at these redshifts. The complex system qualitatively resembles a massive (cluster) galaxy forming early through a rapid succession of mergers. TGSSJ1530+1049 is an unresolved source down to ~0.6\" scale in multiple radio surveys. To reveal its high-resolution radio structure and allow for a detailed comparison with JWST observations, we studied its morphology at various angular scales with different radio interferometric instruments. We observed TGSSJ1530+1049 at milliarcsecond (mas) scale angular resolution with the European VLBI Network (EVN), and at ~100-mas scale resolution with the enhanced Multi-Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN). We recovered a complex north--south oriented structure with steep-spectrum radio-emitting features, which are associated with lobes and hot spots of a jetted active galactic nucleus. The centre of the radio galaxy proved to be too faint at cm wavelengths to be unambiguously detected in our observations. Nevertheless, the linear size (~5.5 kpc) and the radio power place it among the so-called medium-sized symmetric objects, a smaller and/or confined version of larger radio galaxies. Comparison between the radio morphology and that of the ionized gas observed by JWST shows that the two are closely aligned. However, the optical emission line gas extends out to ~25 kpc, which is well beyond the detected radio structures. (Abridged)",

Our method targets short-duration ($\\lesssim 2\\,\\text{s}$) GW signals, exemplified by mergers of compact objects forming or involving an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Such short signals are difficult to distinguish from background noise; yet their brevity makes them well-suited to machine-learning analyses with modest computational requirements. Using the data from the Einstein Telescope Mock Data Challenge as a benchmark, we demonstrate that the approach can successfully flag GW-like transients as anomalies in interferometer data of a single detector, achieving an initial detection efficiency of 23% for injected signals corresponding to IMBH-forming mergers. After introducing weak supervision, the model exhibits excellent generalisation and recovers all injected IMBH-forming mergers, independent of their total mass or signal-to-noise ratio, with a false-alarm rate due to statistical noise fluctuations of approximately 4.5 events per year for a single interferometer operating with a 100% duty cycle. The method also successfully identifies lower-mass mergers leading to the formation of black holes with mass larger than $\\simeq 20\\,M_\\odot$. Our pipeline does not yet classify anomalies, distinguishing between actual GW signals and noise artefacts; however, it highlights any deviation from the learned background noise distribution for further scrutiny. These results demonstrate that anomaly detection offers a powerful, model-independent framework for future GW searches, paving the way toward fully automated and adaptive analysis pipelines.",

        "abstract": "Upgrades to current gravitational wave detectors for the next observation run and upcoming third-generation observatories, like the Einstein telescope, are expected to have enormous improvements in detection sensitivities and compact object merger event rates. Estimation of source parameters for a wider parameter space that these detectable signals will lie in, will be a computational challenge. Thus, it is imperative to have methods to speed-up the likelihood calculations with theoretical waveform predictions, which can ultimately make the parameter estimation faster and aid in rapid multi-messenger follow-ups. Towards this end, we present a conditional variational auto-encoder model, based on the best performing architecture of Liao+2021, for faster generation of aligned-spin SEOBNRv4 inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms. Our parameter space consists of four parameters, [$m_1$, $m_2$, $\\chi_1(z)$, $\\chi_2(z)$]. The masses are uniformly sampled in $[5,75]\\,M_{\\odot}$ with a mass ratio limit at $10\\,M_{\\odot}$, while the spins are uniform in $[-0.99,0.99]$. We train the model using $\\sim10^5$ input waveforms data with a 70\\%/10\\% train/validation split, while 20\\% data are reserved for testing. The median mismatch for the generated waveforms in the test dataset is $\\sim10^{-2}$, with better performance in a restricted parameter space of $\\chi_{\\rm eff}\\in[-0.80,0.80]$. Our model is able to generate 100 waveforms in 0.1 second at an average speed of about 4.46 ms per waveform. This is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than the native SEOBNRv4 implementation in lalsimulation. The latent sampling uncertainty of our model can be quantified with a mean mismatch deviation of $2\\times10^{-1}$ for 1000 generations of the same waveform. Our work aims to be the first step towards developing a production-ready machine learning framework for the faster generation of gravitational waveform approximations.",

        "abstract": "We present a method for efficiently searching long-duration gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescences (CBCs). The approach exploits the smooth frequency-domain behavior of ratios between neighboring waveform templates. The matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time series of a data segment is first computed for a reference template, and the SNRs of nearby templates are then reconstructed by convolving this reference SNR time series with the ratio waveforms, defined as the frequency-domain ratios between the reference and neighboring templates. The computational speedup arises because the ratio waveforms can be safely truncated: they are significant only over a short interval approximately equal to the duration difference between the templates. Storing these truncated ratio waveforms is practical and enables additional efficiency gains, in contrast to storing full templates, which is generally infeasible for long-duration, low-mass signals. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method with mock non-spinning CBC injections in the $1-3~M_\\odot$ range. The reconstructed SNR time series agrees with that obtained from standard matched filtering to an accuracy of $O(10^{-4})$, while the relative computational cost is reduced by $\\gtrsim 25\\%$. With a truncation threshold of $10^{-3}$ applied to the ratio waveform amplitudes, the storage requirement is reduced by a factor of $\\sim 60$ relative to storing the full template bank.",

        "abstract": "PSR B1237+25 is perhaps the canonical example of a pulsar with a core/double cone profile. Moreover, it is bright with little spectral turnover, and its profile perhaps uniquely remains undistorted by scattering far into the decametric band. Here we assemble more than a dozen of the highest quality profiles (30 MHz to 5 GHz) from half a dozen observatories, where possible polarimetric. The pulsar's 2.6$^{\\circ}$ core component marks the magnetic axis longitude, and we confirm that this point coincides both with the linear polarization angle inflection point and the zero-crossing of its antisymmetric circular signature -- thus providing the possibility to estimate emission heights over a very broad band using aberration/retardation (A/R). We then carefully fit the profile components with Gaussians to identify and study the subtle asymmetries produced by A/R. We find a consistent A/R in the pulsar's profiles of some 0.5$^{\\circ}$ longitude or 2 ms -- corresponding to a putative conal emission height of 200-400 km -- with a formal error of about 100 km. Our analysis finds no evidence whatsoever for an emission height increase with wavelength, the so-called ``radius-to-frequency mapping''. Nor do we find any significant difference in A/R effect between the outer and inner cones.",

We impose one unimodular constraint per metric via multipliers $\\lambda_{1,2}$ and show that two natural implementations-a dual fixed-determinant (BUG) and a dual diffeomorphism-invariant (BHT/BDUG) formulation-are classically inequivalent. In BUG the relative volume element $\\nu=\\sqrt{1-2BX}$ is fixed, enforcing a kinematic constraint on the biscalar and we derive the \"bimodular cosmological constant\" $\\Lambda=\\lambda_1+\\nu\\lambda_2$. In BHT/BDUG, $\\lambda_{1,2}$ are individually constant but $\\nu$ (hence $BX$) remains dynamical. Recasting the theory in an Einstein-frame form, we derive the biscalar sound speed and identify a subluminal domain $1+B(V+\\lambda_2)>0$. At the background level, BUG admits constant-roll solutions governed by first-order flow, whereas BHT supports solutions with time-dependent roll. These structural differences yield distinct, in-principle testable predictions for the expansion history, the dark-energy equation of state, and the propagation of biscalar perturbations.

When applied to numerical-relativity simulations, the SMA test performs reliably for aligned-spin and mildly precessing systems but exhibits measurable biases for strongly precessing or eccentric binaries. Although designed to detect amplitude deviations, the test also responds coherently to phase perturbations, yielding apparent GR violations when applied to phase-modified waveforms. Applied to recent GW detections, we report the strongest constraint on the hexadecapolar (4,4) mode amplitude deviation, $\\delta A_{44} = -0.30^{+1.16}_{-3.45}$, consistent with GR.

Using Chandra ACIS-I/S X-ray data supplemented with HST WFC3 imaging, we measure four morphological parameters: the concentration parameter (c), asymmetry parameter (A), centroid shift (log(w)), and the X-ray-BCG centroid separation (D [kpc]). Our goals are to (A) provide a robust classification of the dynamical state of the clusters in this strong lensing selected sample to enable studies that test various problems in cluster astrophysics and observational cosmology; (B) identify correlations, biases, or disagreements between different measurement proxies and cluster properties; and (C) measure the relaxation fraction (the fraction of clusters classified as relaxed based on X-ray morphology) and compare it to relaxation fractions from cluster samples selected using other methods.   We combine the four morphological parameters into a single metric, the combined parameter M, which effectively separates the cluster sample into four dynamical state categories: relaxed; moderately relaxed; moderately disturbed; and disturbed. We find no significant trend in a cluster's dynamical state with its size, and only a weak, statistically limited dependence on mass and redshift. Based on our classification system, we find that $43\\%^{+9}_{-9}$ of the clusters are relaxed, which is consistent with relaxation fractions measured for other cluster samples selected on mass-observables.

        "abstract": "Rapidly rotating late M dwarfs are observed in two different branches of magnetic activity, although they operate in the same stellar parameter range. Current empirical evidence indicates that M dwarfs with spectral types ranging from M3 / M4 to late-type M dwarfs, stellar masses smaller than 0.15 M$_\\odot$, and rotational period shorter than four days display either a stable dipolar magnetic field or magnetic structures with significant time variability. The magnetic activity of fully convective M dwarfs is known to be regulated by a mechanism named the ${\\alpha}^2$ dynamo. To further constrain the physics of this mechanism, we use a low-dimensional model for thermally driven magnetoconvection producing an ${\\alpha}^2$ dynamo, specifically a modified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shell model. Although the model neglects density stratification, it captures the essential nonlinear dynamics of an $\\alpha^2$ dynamo. Therefore, the results should be interpreted in a qualitative sense, highlighting possible trends rather than providing direct quantitative predictions for fully convective stars. The model is validated by comparing the statistical properties of magnetic polarity reversals with paleomagnetic data, since the geodynamo provides the only natural ${\\alpha}^2$ dynamo with sufficiently rich reversal statistics. Our findings reveal that increased convective heat transport correlates with more frequent magnetic-polarity reversals, resulting in enhanced magnetic variability. This suggests that the observed magnetic dichotomy in late M dwarfs could be interpreted in terms of differences in global heat transport efficiency. However, additional models and observations of M dwarfs are needed to further constrain this interpretation.",

We identified clumps in these regions using the \\texttt{FellWalker} algorithm and derived the dust temperature and column density by fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED) using combined JCMT and \\textit{Herschel} dust continuum maps. We analyzed the magnetic field morphology in the vicinity of the L328 core and employed the structure function analysis to determine the magnetic field dispersion angle. We used the modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method to estimate magnetic field strengths and also derived the mass-to-flux ratio and Alfv\\'en Mach number.",

        "abstract": "We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the rapidly declining Type IIL supernova (SN) 2016iog. SN 2016iog reached its peak $\\sim$ 14 days after explosion, with an absolute magnitude in the $V$ band of $-18.64 \\pm 0.15$ mag, followed by a steep decline of $8.85 \\pm 0.15$~mag~(100\\,d)$^{-1}$ post-peak. Such a high decline rate makes SN~2016iog one of the fastest declining Type~IIL SNe observed to date. The rapid rise in the light curve, combined with the nearly featureless continuum observed in the spectrum at +9.3 days, suggests the presence of interaction. In the recombination phase, we observed broad H$\\alpha$ lines that persist at all epochs. In addition, the prominent double-peaked H$\\alpha$ feature observed in the late-time spectrum (+190.8 days) is likely attributable either to significant dust formation within a cool dense shell or to asymmetric circumstellar material. These features suggest the presence of sustained interaction around SN~2016iog. We propose that the observed characteristics of SN~2016iog can be qualitatively explained by assuming a low-mass H-rich envelope surrounding a red supergiant progenitor star with low-density circumstellar material.",

The source exhibits a stable flux across the entire exposure with no detectable pulsations by any instrument on their X-ray light curves, placing pulsed-fraction upper limits of 10% and 32% for XMM$-$Newton and NuSTAR, respectively. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by two thermal components consistent with the emission from an accretion disk, and shows a weak high-energy tail above 10 keV, with no statistical requirement for an additional nonthermal component. The unabsorbed $0.3-20$ keV luminosity is ${\\sim}2\\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, evidencing the ULX nature of the source. The parameters obtained from spectral modeling are consistent with the hard ultraluminous state. Despite the fact that a neutron-star accretor cannot be ruled out by the available data, under the assumption that the compact object in NGC 5055 ULX X-1 is a black hole accreting through a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure-supported disk that drives an optically thick wind, we constrained its putative mass to $11-26$ M$_{\\odot}$.",

        "abstract": "Recent detections of very-high-energy (VHE; $\\gtrsim 100$~GeV) emission from GRB afterglows, notably the unprecedented brightness of GRB~221009A observed by LHAASO, reveal emission components beyond the standard electron synchrotron model. Multi-TeV photons motivate synchrotron self-Compton and possibly hadronic contributions, while the non-detection of coincident neutrinos by IceCube/KM3NeT/GRAND200k constrains the microphysical parameters, jet kinetic energy and ambient medium density. We model the VHE afterglow of GRB 221009A with an external forward shock from a Gaussian structured jet in a uniform density medium. This angular structure reproduces the extreme TeV output at an off-axis angle but without demanding large energies as in a top-hat jet. We also compute the corresponding $p\\gamma$ neutrino flux in the PeV-EeV energies and derive a time-integrated upper limit based on the effective areas of IceCube Gen2 and GRAND200k, providing the contributions of individual GRBs to the neutrino events. The predicted neutrino flux for GRB 221009A with model parameters inferred from multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution lies below the sensitivities of these detectors. Even under highly optimistic microphysical conditions, our correlation analysis infers that the events from this GRB are of order $\\sim 0.1$ for upcoming GRAND200k. We also compare neutrino fluxes for on-axis and off-axis viewing geometries and find that jet orientation alone can introduce nearly an order of magnitude variation in the signal. Thus, our studies imply that a GRB both brighter and closer than GRB 221009A would be crucial for any neutrino detections by upcoming neutrino telescopes. Future GRB detections by the CTA will provide important constraints on their geometry, radiation mechanisms, and any potential associated neutrino signals.",

        "abstract": "To date, hundreds of sub-stellar objects with masses between $1-80\\ M_{\\rm Jup}$ have been detected orbiting main-sequence stars. The current convention uses the deuterium-burning limit, $M_c \\approx 13 M_{\\rm Jup}$ to divide this population between giant planets and brown dwarfs. However, this classification heuristic is largely divorced from any formation physics and may not accurately reflect the astrophysical nature of these objects. Previous work has suggested that a transition from ``planet-like'' to ``brown-dwarf-like'' characteristics occurs somewhere in the range $1-10 M_{\\rm Jup}$, but precise the crossover mass and whether the transition is gradual or abrupt remains unknown. Here, we explore how the occurrence rate, host star metallicity, and orbital eccentricities vary as a function of mass in a sample of 70 Doppler-detected sub-stellar objects ($0.8 < M_c/M_{\\rm Jup} < 80$) from the California Legacy Survey. Our population consists of objects near and beyond the water ice line ($1 < a / \\text{AU} < 10$), providing valuable clues to the details of giant planet formation physics at a location in the proto-stellar disk where planet formation efficiency is thought to be enhanced. We find that occurrence rate, host star metallicity, and orbital eccentricity all change gradually across the mass range under consideration, suggesting that ``bottom-up'' core accretion mechanisms and ``top-down'' gravitational instability mechanisms produce objects that overlap in mass. The observed eccentricity distributions could arise either from different formation channels or from post-formation dynamical interactions between massive sub-stellar objects.",

Pre-launch calibration observations, post-launch Venus transit and lunar transit data were used to develop the PSF and evaluate how well it reproduced the observed scattering. The PSF reported differs from previous stray light removal efforts since we do not use Gaussians as the central mathematical component. Instead, we use a Lorenztian convolved with an Airy function. In 2018, the HMI team began providing full-disk, stray-light-corrected data daily. Intensity, Doppler, magnetogram, and vector magnetic field data are provided. The deconvolution uses a Richardson-Lucy algorithm and takes less than one second per full-disk image. The results, on average, show decreases in umbral continuum intensity, a doubling of the granulation intensity contrast, increases in the total field strength, most notably in plage by $\\sim$1.4--2.5 the original value, and a partial correction for the convective blueshift. Local helioseismology analyses using corrected data yield results that are consistent with those from uncorrected data, with only negligible differences, except in sunspot regions. The new data are found in JSOC with names similar to the original but with the qualifying term '$\\_dcon$' or '$\\_dconS$' appended, denoting whether the deconvolution was applied to the filtergrams or Stokes images. The HMI team recommends using the corrected data for improved visual clarity, more accurate irradiance reconstruction, better co-alignment with high-resolution data, reduced errors in tracking algorithms, and improved magnetic field strengths.",

        "abstract": "Compact binary systems emitting gravitational waves (GWs) can exhibit orbital eccentricity, along with generic spin orientations, leading to the precession of the orbital angular momentum, individual spins, and the orbital plane. While eccentric binaries with aligned spins are well studied, closed form post Newtonian (PN) expressions that simultaneously include eccentricity and precessing spin effects have remained unavailable. Eccentricity complicates orbital evolution because solving the coupled differential equations typically requires numerical integration, which slows down the generation of waveforms. We exploit the separation of timescales between orbital motion, spin precession, and radiation reaction, applying the precession averaging method of Morras et al. (2025) to remove explicit time dependence from the spin orbit and spin spin dynamics through the second PN order. Using this framework, we derive analytic phasing formulae from the evolution equations for orbital frequency and eccentricity, treating eccentricity as a small parameter. Closed form solutions for the eccentricity evolution and GW phase are obtained up to eighth order in the initial eccentricity. We also generalize the TaylorT2 approximant to include spin precession effects and compute the orbital phase in both time and frequency domains. To improve accuracy for moderate to high initial eccentricities, we perform a resummation of the TaylorT2 phasing. These results offer efficient, closed form phasing expressions that capture the coupled dynamics of eccentricity and precession, enabling more accurate and computationally tractable GW waveform modeling for data analysis.",

        "abstract": "The structure and basic properties of dense nuclear matter still remain one of the open problems of Physics. In particular, the composition of the matter that composes neutron stars is under theoretical and experimental investigation. Among the theories that have been proposed, apart from the classical one where the composition is dominated by hadrons, the existence or coexistence of deconfined quark matter is a dominant guess. An approach towards this solution is the phenomenological view according to which the existence of quarkyonic matter plays a dominant role in the construction of the equation of state (EOS). According to it the structure of the EOS is based on the existence of the quarkyonic particle which is a hybrid state of a particle that combines properties of hadronic and quark matter with a corresponding representation in momentum space. In this paper we propose a phenomenological model for hot quarkyonic matter, borrowed from corresponding applications in hadronic models, where the interaction in the quarkyonic matter depends not only on the position but also on the momentum of the quarkyonic particles. This consideration, as we demonstrate, can have a remarkable consequence on the shape of the EOS and thus on the properties of neutron stars, especially in those for which the effect of temperature is significant, offering a sufficiently flexible model. Comparison with recent observational data can place constraints on the parameterization of the particular model and help improve its reliability.",

KDP is fully transparent at wavelengths from ultraviolet to 1.3$\\mu$m, but becomes highly opaque at wavelengths >2$\\mu$m. We demonstrate on-sky use of KDP by improving performance of a cryogenic broadband filter with known off-band thermal leak, and using a non-cryogenic narrow band filter for deep observation. KDP reduces the sky background by 4.5 magnitudes in the leaky Z-band filter we use. Our 4nm wide, central wavelength 1.191$\\mu$m narrowband filter in combination with KDP reduces the sky surface brightness by three magnitudes compared to a J broadband. We find a sky surface brightness of 18.5mag arcsec$^{-2}$ at 1.191$\\mu$m, and interpret it as the airglow continuum. KDP is an excellent thermal blocker, when its temperature is maintained above its Curie point at 123K. Below Curie point, KDP transforms its crystal structure, degrading its otherwise good imaging properties.",

        "abstract": "We present a comprehensive spectral-timing analysis of a BHXB Swift J1727.8$-$1613 during its 2023 outburst, using five pointed \\textit{NuSTAR} observations sampling the luminous hard-intermediate state. Broadband 3-79 keV spectroscopy employs a physically motivated model combining a cool truncated disk (\\texttt{diskbb}), relativistic reflection (\\texttt{relxill} in reflection-only mode), and Comptonized continuum (\\texttt{nthComp}) to probe the inner accretion geometry around a rapidly spinning black hole ($a_\\ast\\!=\\!0.98$) at moderate inclination. Simultaneous timing analysis reveals type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with novel coherence evolution: the quality factor ($Q$) exhibits a striking non-monotonic dependence on both QPO frequency and luminosity, peaking near $\\nu_{\\rm QPO}\\!\\sim\\!1.2$~Hz and declining at both lower and higher frequencies. This turnover directly constrains Lense-Thirring precession geometry, implying optimal coherence at intermediate truncation radius. A tight photon-index-QPO-frequency correlation demonstrates that spectral softening and frequency rise are concurrent signatures of inward truncation-radius motion. The triadic luminosity evolution-rising disk and Compton, declining reflection-traces precession-driven geometry changes and corona beaming effects. Interpreting disk-normalization variability as apparent-area changes rather than physical radius swings provides new insight into disk-corona boundary layers. These quantitative results provide strong evidence for global Lense-Thirring precession regulation of both timing and spectral properties, establishing Swift J1727.8$-$1613 as a benchmark source for understanding accretion-geometry physics during black hole state transitions.",

The basic mechanism by which solar prominences acquire these common structures during their evolution, however, remains an unresolved question. For the first time, our three-dimensional magneto-frictional simulation, driven by supergranular motions, self-consistently replicates the commonly observed multi-arch bridge morphology and its characteristic structures of solar quiescent prominences in a magnetic flux rope. In comparison with traditional views, our simulations demonstrate that the spine, feet, and voids (bubbles) are inherent prominence structures spontaneously forming as the flux rope evolves to a mature state. The voids mainly consist of legs of sheared magnetic loops caused by unbalanced supergranular flows, and prominence feet settle at the bottom of helical field lines piled up from the photosphere to the spine. Similarities between the simulated prominences and observed real prominences by the Chinese H$\\alpha$ Solar Explorer, the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, and NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory suggest the high validity of our model. This work corroborates the pivotal role of photospheric supergranulation as a helicity injection source in the formation and shaping of quiescent prominence structures within the solar atmosphere, thereby paving a new avenue for future investigations into their fine dynamics and stability.",

However, such a phantom-crossing dark energy evolution further exacerbates the already severe Hubble tension in the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Moreover, there exists a $\\sim2\\sigma$ tension between the DESI DR2 BAO and CMB datasets. Therefore, it is essential to measure the Hubble constant and dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameters using only late-universe observations. In this work, we investigate a novel late-universe data combination: gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, BAO, and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). This combination provides a fully distance-ladder- and CMB-independent determination of the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS. Using 47 GW standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, the DESI DR2 BAO data, and DESY5 SNe Ia data, in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we obtain $H_0=74.8^{+6.3}_{-8.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\\Omega_{\\rm m}=0.320^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, $w_0=-0.775^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$, and $w_a=-0.80\\pm0.47$, indicating a mild phantom-crossing behavior within the $1\\sigma$ credible interval with an $H_0$ value consistent with the distance ladder measurements. Our analysis demonstrates the power of GW standard sirens in breaking parameter degeneracies, and this novel data combination provides joint constraints on the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS parameters.",

        "abstract": "Solar hard X-ray observations provide diagnostics of the hottest plasmas and of nonthermal electron populations present during solar flares and coronal mass ejections. HXR images of specific energy ranges often contain overlapping contributions of these components, complicating their interpretation. This is even more challenging as HXR imagers generally use an indirect imaging system. Our work aims to separately image individual spectral components, such as thermal loops, superhot sources, and nonthermal footpoint sources, rather than obtaining images of specific energy ranges that show a combination of all components. We introduce a new method called spectral component imaging and apply it to observations provided by the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) aboard Solar Orbiter. First, the flare integrated HXR spectrum is fitted with individual spectral components to get the relative contributions of each component in each native STIX energy channel. In a second step, a set of linear equations is created based on these weights and the observed, energy-dependent STIX visibilities. The visibilities of the individual spectral components are derived by means of a linear least-squares approach and are subsequently utilized for image reconstructions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of spectral component imaging on four different flares observed by STIX. This method provides powerful diagnostics, particularly for flares with hot and superhot components, allowing us to spatially separate these two thermal components. We apply our methodology to the nonthermal peak of the X7.1 flare SOL2024-10-01, and we find that the superhot component is located 4.8 Mm away from the hot thermal loops. The thermal energy of the superhot component is approximately 20% of the energy content of the hot component, highlighting the significance of superhot components in the total flare energy budget.",

The population of merging binary black holes has been used so far to provide a constraint on the Hubble constant and dark matter fraction under the hypothesis of a flat-$\\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter Universe.   In this work, we provide the first non-parametric constrain on the Hubble parameter from 137 dark sirens reported in GWTC-4.0. We employ the relation between detector and source frame masses for detected GW signals, to obtain a statistical redshift evaluation for the population of binary black holes (BBHs). We model the Hubble parameter as a non-parametric autoregressive process in terms of the scale factor, using splines. In addition, we introduce two novel features: the use of \\textit{anchor} points for $H(z)$ derived from an external probe - here, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) - and a constraining power coefficient that quantifies where the inference is most data-driven by GW detections.   We highlight three key findings: (i) using GWs alone, the Hubble parameter determination is the most GW-data-driven around redshift $z = 0.44$, yielding to $H(0.44) = 92.3_{-36.6}^{+29.9}\\rm\\, km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$. Its value at $z = 0$, the Hubble constant, is therefore less constrained by the GW data. (ii) The Hubble parameter inferred from analyses assuming a flat-$\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model is strongly affected by the cosmological model assumption. (iii) Introducing an anchor point for $H(z)$ enhances the inferred constraints and provides a clear visualization of the redshift range where GWs contribute most to the constraining power.",

By explicitly deriving and numerically integrating the full second-order kernel of the Einstein equations, we obtain a scale-invariant scalar spectrum without invoking a fundamental scalar field. In this framework, the amplitude of the scalar fluctuations is directly linked to the scale of inflation. More precisely, we show that matching the observed level of scalar fluctuations, $\\Delta_{\\phi}^2(k_\\ast)\\approx 10^{-9}$ at Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales, fixes the inflationary energy scale $H_{\\rm inf}$ as a function of the number of observed e-folds $N_{\\rm obs}$.

Specifically, using laboratory constraints on the number of species limits the duration of inflation to $N_{\\rm obs}\\lesssim 126$ e-folds. These results establish the IWI scenario as a predictive and falsifiable alternative to standard inflaton-driven models, linking the observed amplitude of primordial fluctuations directly to the quantum nature and finite lifetime of dS space.",

Flare occurrence rates and activity levels of M dwarfs correlate with stellar characteristics such as age, mass, and rotation period.

We detect flares in the light curves of these stars, including 276 of 538 M dwarfs within 15 pc, and calculate cumulative flare frequency distributions (FFDs) for each star. Based on flaring behavior, we categorize stars into relatively higher and lower activity groups and fit power laws to their FFDs to compare the power law exponent ($\\alpha$) across activity levels. We find $\\alpha =1.99 \\pm 0.07$ for the combined FFD of the lower activity M dwarfs, compared to averages of $\\alpha = 1.94 \\pm 0.58$ for highly active stars with 10-100 detected flares, and $\\alpha = 2.03 \\pm 0.43$ for those with > 100 detected flares, suggesting little evolution in the power law distribution of flares as M dwarfs transition from high to low activity states. The uncertainties for the active star groups reflect the standard deviation of $\\alpha$ values across individual stars within each subset. Because stellar flares and associated stellar activity complicate exoplanet observations, we also examine the subset of M dwarfs with JWST transmission spectroscopy follow-up observations in Cycles 1-3. The flares we detect for these targets are consistent with the broader 15 pc sample, providing context for interpreting planetary atmosphere retrievals from JWST spectra.",

These results are usually obtained in the context of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameterizations, generally implying in phantom-crossing at intermediate redshifts. However, a general mapping between these parameterizations that yields approximately the same background observables clouds the inference of the true nature of dark energy in the context of these parametric methods. In this work, we propose a model-independent reconstruction of the dark energy density, which is more directly constrained than its EoS, based on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression method with the use of DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 SN Ia samples. In addition, we perform a statistical comparison between the energy densities of $\\Lambda$, a non-phantom thawing quintessence-type dark energy, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization with the reconstructed function. We find that all models agree with the GP reconstruction at 95\\% C.L., with the largest discrepancy coming from $\\Lambda$CDM with DESY5 at low redshifts.

        "abstract": "The POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a NASA mission designed to study Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays and Very-High-Energy Neutrinos from a balloon platform. Serving as a precursor to the planned POEMMA satellite mission, PBR will be launched aboard a NASA Super Pressure Balloon for a flight at of 33 km altitude in Spring 2027 from Wanaka, New Zealand. The unique conditions of low pressure and high altitude will enable in-situ observations of High-Altitude Horizontal Air Showers (HAHAs), a poorly understood class of nearly horizontal Extensive Air Showers induced by cosmic rays skimming the Earth's atmosphere without reaching the ground. Due to the lower atmospheric grammage at these altitudes, HAHAs develop more gradually compared to typical downward-going EASs, with interaction lengths on the order of 100 km. This slow development allows balloon-borne instruments to probe the early stages of cosmic ray shower evolution. At these early stages, high-energy electrons and positrons from the electromagnetic component of the shower can generate X-rays and gamma rays via synchrotron radiation. The X-$\\gamma$ detector onboard PBR is designed to measure these photons across a broad energy range. The instrument consists of four sub-detectors, each optimized for different overlapping energy bandfrom tens of keV to MeV. The current design utilizes CsI(Tl)/NaI(Tl) scintillating crystals coupled with SiPMs for photon detection. To suppress background noise, the detectors are enclosed within an anti-coincidence system to reject charged particle events. The X-$\\gamma$ detector is aligned with PBR's primary instruments, the Fluorescence Camera and the Cherenkov Camera, within a 30$^\\circ$ field of view, overlapping with both imaging cameras. It will operate in a triggered mode, with the possibility to receive signals from the other instruments to check for simultaneous events.",

Detailed comparisons to the spectral observations reveal that the H$\\alpha$ line is too broad, the Fe II red wing is too bright, and the NUV continuum decays too slowly in a fiducial high-flux beam model. However, chromospheric condensations with maximum electron densities of $n_e \\approx 5 \\times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ and optical depths $\\tau \\approx 1$ in the near wing of H$\\alpha$ are consistent with the observed intensity of a broad spectrum in the Southern ribbon. Model similarities demonstrate that Fe I emission lines and the FUV continuum intensity can form at chromospheric heights during flares, but I find that the ratios of the NUV to FUV continuum intensities are generally too large in the models. This suggests that radiative-hydrodynamic models of chromospheric condensations cool through $T \\approx 30,000$ K too rapidly. The larger than expected FUV continuum intensities are not nearly bright enough to explain recent stellar megaflare spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope.",

Using a modular back-tracing framework, we explore a set of widely used magnetic-field descriptions - from a Parker spiral baseline to more structured configurations that include latitudinal wind contrasts, Smith-Bieber-type azimuthal strengthening, and tilted or wavy heliospheric current sheets. Across these models the picture is consistent: most bending is accumulated within the inner tens of astronomical units and decreases rapidly with energy. Field choices and solar-cycle geometry set the overall normalization, with stronger spiral winding or a more highly tilted current sheet producing larger deflections at the same energy. Differences between electrons and positrons are most apparent at lower energies, where drift histories and current-sheet encounters diverge, and become increasingly small at multi-TeV energies. We summarize these trends with a practical threshold energy describing when heliospheric bending falls below an instrument's angular resolution, and we verify that our conclusions are robust to numerical settings. For current instruments, heliospheric effects can usually be treated as a small correction at the highest energies, while sub-TeV analyses benefit from a calibrated envelope that accounts for plausible field configurations during the observing epoch.",

However, when optimising for parameters of probabilistic models, incorporating second order information during optimisation can lead to a more direct path in the distribution space and faster convergence. In this work we examine whether using natural gradient descent can improve the performance of variational inference based classification of radio galaxies. We use the Improved Variational Online Newton (iVON) algorithm and compare its performance against a recent benchmark for BNNs for radio galaxy classification. We find that iVON results in better uncertainty calibration out of all the methods previously considered while providing similar predictive performance to the best performing inference methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Bayes by Backprop based variational inference. Models trained with iVON can distinguish far out-of-distribution optical galaxy data, but they cannot reliably detect radio galaxy images from a telescope with different resolution and sensitivity. We find that the cold posterior effect persists in the models trained with iVON. Our results suggest that the choice of the optimiser can lead to qualitatively different solutions and future work using probabilistic neural network models should carefully consider the inductive biases being encoded through the optimisation process, in addition to the data, architecture and inference method.",

Using the black hole perturbation theory surrogate model \\textsc{BHPTNRSur1dq1e4} as a reference, we assess the performance of the \\textsc{IMRPhenomX} phenomenological family in the high-mass-ratio regime. We find that the inclusion of higher-order gravitational wave modes is critical; their exclusion may degrade the signal-to-noise ratio by factors of $\\sim3-5$ relative to quadrupole-only templates. With optimal mode inclusion, SSM-IMRIs are observable out to luminosity distances of $\\sim575$ Mpc ($z\\sim0.12$) with Advanced LIGO and $\\sim10.5$ Gpc ($z\\sim1.4$) with the Einstein Telescope. However, we identify substantial systematic uncertainties in current phenomenological approximants. Matches between \\textsc{IMRPhenomX} and the reference surrogate model \\textsc{BHPTNRSur1dq1e4} degrade to values as low as 0.2 for edge-on inclinations, and fitting factors consistently fall below 0.9, indicating a significant loss of effectualness in template-bank searches. Bayesian parameter estimation reveals that these modeling discrepancies induce systematic biases that exceed statistical errors by multiple standard deviations, underscoring the necessity for waveform models calibrated to perturbation theory in the intermediate mass-ratio regime for robust detection and inference.",

Sample binaries with monotonic period variations are collected from the literature, together with well-determined binary parameters. Assuming the monotonic variations are responsible for any one of the MT, ML, and AML, their rates are calculated with the rates of change of period. After selecting crucial parameters using partial least-squares analysis, a parameter that exhibits the closest correlation with any one of the derived rates is further selected using partial regression plots. Moreover, power-law relationships are found for the discovered correlations. The properties of the sample binaries are also investigated by examining associations between binary parameters. In the systems with negative period variations, it is found that the rate of MT from more- to less-massive stars is a function of the primary radius; the AML rate is a function of the fill-out factor. In addition, the relationships between the mass ratio and stellar masses indicate that the ML rate relative to the MT rate decreases with increasing mass ratio below ~0.46. Meanwhile, in the systems with positive variations, it is found that the rate of MT from less- to more-massive stars is a function of the luminosity ratio and/or mass ratio; the ML rate is a function of the secondary temperature. The discussion also addresses possible processes occurring in the sample binaries.",

It is designed for polarization observations of transient sources in the soft X-ray energy range with a wide field of view (FOV). To validate the key technologies required for wide-FOV X-ray polarization measurements, the Cosmic X-ray Polarization Detector (CXPD) CubeSat was developed as a prototype for the LPD. The CXPD is equipped with two Gas Microchannel Plate Pixel Detectors (GMPDs) that measure X-ray polarization via the photoelectric effect, where ejected photoelectrons produce ionization tracks in the gas which are imaged to reconstruct their emission directions. Laboratory calibrations of the modulation factor and energy spectra were successfully performed using linear polarized X-ray sources at 2.98 keV, 4.51 keV, 6.40 keV, and 8.05 keV. Since its launch in June 2023, the CXPD has successfully completed critical in-orbit technology verification. It has also performed polarization observations of two bright X-ray sources Sco X-1 and the transient Swift J1727.8-1613 yielding constraints on their polarization degrees and angles. Notably, this was the first time that an anti-coincidence detector had been implemented in an X-ray polarimeter, enabling in-orbit verification of the charged-particle background rejection algorithm. These results demonstrate the feasibility of wide-field soft X-ray polarization measurements and provide essential guidance for the development of the LPD for the POLAR-2 mission, thereby advancing the frontier of X-ray polarization astronomy.",

Here, we report a calibration method that enables the simultaneous determination of the backend noise temperature and effective-noise-ratio at the input plane of the DUT. The method is based on measuring the S-parameters and noise power of a series of attenuators at two or more distinct physical temperatures. We validate our method by measuring the noise temperature of InP HEMTs in 4-8 GHz. The calibration method can be generalized to measure the microwave noise temperature of any two-port device so long as a series of attenuators can be measured at two or more distinct physical temperatures.",

        "abstract": "Conventional Leptogenesis mechanism, which provides compelling explanation to the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU), assumes the absence of hypermagnetic field in the early universe, thereby disregard the implications of hyper gauge field helicity, that have been thoroughly studied in the magnetogenesis mechanism. In this paper, we address impacts of a general U(1) gauge field on Leptogenesis by deriving equation of motions for the helicity and the energy density of a general magnetic field, to which the chiral magnetic effect (CME) is identified as essential, and studying their effects on the evolution chiral asymmetries. Notably, CME in the $U(1)_{\\mathbf{L}_i-\\mathbf{L}_j}$ framework, where $\\mathbf{L}_{i,j}$ means specific lepton flavor, explicitly breaks the total lepton number and provides an efficient spectator process, that can wash out pre-existing lepton asymmetries. This establishes a natural connection to the wash-in Leptogenesis paradigm. We demonstrate that this spectator effect enables the generation of the BAU, eliminating the need for both an initial $\\mathbf{B}-\\mathbf{L}$ charge and primordial helicity.",

        "abstract": "Old, thermally bright neutron stars imply internal heating at late times. Among candidate mechanisms, vortex creep heating (VCH) provides a robust link between spin-down and frictional dissipation in the pinned inner-crust superfluid, yet its interplay with fast DUrca cooling in massive stars remains insufficiently explored.   We (i) implement VCH in our cooling code and validate it; (ii) identify the physically consistent domain where the steady-state form $L_{\\text{h}}=J|\\dot\\Omega_\\infty|$ applies; (iii) quantify how $(B,P_0)$ regulate observable VCH signatures under DUrca cooling; and (iv) introduce a 3D representation that resolves degeneracies hidden in standard 2D projections.   Cooling is computed with BSk24 and APR EoS, standard pairing gaps, and iron/carbon envelopes. VCH is modeled with $J\\simeq10^{42.9\\text{--}43.8}$ erg s, and a quantum-creep coverage fraction $f_{\\text{Q}}(t)$ diagnoses when steady-state heating is valid. We survey $B=10^{10\\text{--}13}$ G and $P_0=10$--$570$ ms for $1.4$ and $2.0\\,M_\\odot$, and compare with a curated set of ordinary pulsars with measured $(P,\\dot P)$.   Results: (1) Our implementation reproduces published VCH bands. (2) The $(B,P_0)$ validity boundary follows magnetic-dipole spin-down, confirming consistency with $|\\dot\\Omega|$. (3) DUrca+VCH maintains $T_{\\text{s}}^\\infty\\gtrsim10^5$ K for $B\\gtrsim10^{11-12}$ G up to $P_0\\sim10^2$ ms. (4) The 3D representation shows that sources appearing coincident in $(t,T_{\\text{s}}^\\infty)$ occupy distinct $B$-layers, removing degeneracies.   VCH can substantially reshape late-time thermal states when spin-down power remains high; its observability depends chiefly on $(B,P_0)$ rather than on mass alone. We provide a practical $(B,P_0)$ validity map for $L_{\\text{h}}=J|\\dot\\Omega_\\infty|$ and advocate treating $B$ as a co-equal axis in cooling analyses. (Shortened due to the arXiv words limit.)",

        "abstract": "The Functionality of Ice Line Latitudinal EBM Tenacity (FILLET) project is a CUISINES exoplanet model intercomparison project (exo-MIP) that compares various energy balance models (EBMs) through a series of numerical experiments. The objective is to establish rigorous protocols that enable the identification of intrinsic differences among EBMs that could lead to model-dependent results for past, current, and future EBM studies. Such efforts also provide the community with an EBM ensemble average and standard deviation, rather than a single model prediction, on benchmark cases typically used by EBM studies. These experiments include Earth-like planets at different obliquity, instellation, and carbon dioxide abundance. Here we update the v1.0 protocol (Deitrick et al., 2023) to accommodate the requirements of previously untested community models. In particular, we expand the range of carbon dioxide abundances for Experiment 4 to ensure any code will capture both snowball and ice-free end states. Additionally, participants are now required to report two ice edge latitudes per hemisphere to fully distinguish all climate states (snowball, ice caps, ice belts, and ice-free). The outputs described in FILLET protocol version 1.0 have also now been revised to include the maximum and minimum ice extent, in latitude, for each hemisphere, as well as the diffusion coefficient and outgoing longwave radiative flux.",

In this study, we conducted 12-night multicolor optical monitoring using an 85 cm telescope from 2020 September to 2024 June and collected long-term broad-band archived data from radio to $\\gamma$-rays. Intraday variabilities were detected on four nights, and most of them exhibited a bluer-when-brighter behavior. Both clockwise and counterclockwise spectral hysteresis loops were found within a single night. However, no reliable intraband time lag was detected for the intranight variabilities. On long timescales, the cross-correlation analysis shows that the variations of the optical, X-ray, and $\\gamma$-ray bands do not reveal an obvious time delay, while the variations in the radio bands lagged them by about 370 days. The measured time lags suggest two distinct emission regions respectively responsible for the optical to $\\gamma$-ray radiation and for the radio radiation, with a spatial separation of approximately $4.50\\times10^{19}\\ \\rm cm$. We modeled the broad-band spectral energy distributions during four flaring epochs and one quiescent epoch, and found evidence for the possible persistent existence of a very high energy emission region. We also confirmed a spectral evolution of the source from an intermediate synchrotron peaked BL Lac object to a low synchrotron peaked BL Lac object.",

        "abstract": "We present observations and analyses of five little-studied cataclysmic binary stars in the southern celestial hemisphere. Our new observations are from the South African Astronomical Observatory. The objects and salient results are as follows: (i) 6dF0752-54 is a dwarf nova with an orbital period Porb = 5.05 hr that shows a contribution from a mid-M type secondary in its mean spectrum. (ii) J0916-26 had been suspected of being a magnetic CV with an eclipse period of 3.37 hr. Our spectrum corroborates this classification. (iii) GSC 08944 is a novalike variable with Porb = 3.80 hr. Archival photometry also shows a persistent photometric period near 4.03 hr, apparently from a positive super- hump. Its emission line behavior is consistent with an SW Sextantis-type novalike. (iv) MGAB-V253, also Gaia20eys, had been identified as a short-period eclipsing novalike with Porb = 1.44 hr. Our spectrum shows shows broad emission lines consistent with this, and the extensive TESS data show a persistent modulation near 1.35 hr, evidently a negative superhump. It is less luminous than most novalikes, but significantly brighter than quiescent dwarf novae with comparably short periods. (v) Finally, DDE 45 shows a complicated variability history, cycling rapidly between high and low states for a time and more recently showing outbursts resembling a U Gem-type dwarf nova. We find a 2.07 hr radial velocity period, which also appears in archival TESS photometry. The emission lines are double-peaked, with an orbital S-wave similar to low-inclination dwarf novae.

        "abstract": "In this work we investigate the potential of a thermal infrared (IR) space telescope to remotely characterize the component temperatures of a satellite. With the rapid increase in the number of objects launched in recent years, the ability to detect, track, identify and determine the intent of satellites has become of increasing importance. Spectral modeling of satellites from multi-wavelength photometry in the thermal IR is a technique that has the potential to derive information about the temperature and operational status of a satellite in orbit, without the requirement to spatially resolve the target. Previous work has focused on determination of a single/effective temperature for a Resident Space Objects (RSOs) - such as satellites, asteroids, debris and rocket bodies - from remote observations, obtaining mixed results in terms of ability to classify objects. To progress, we explore a two-greybody component spectral model. Using this analytical model, we investigate which temperature characteristics may be identified from unresolved multi-wavelength photometric observations as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, under the assumption of Poisson noise-dominated data. With this instrument-agnostic framework, we then quantify the potential of this model to discriminate between RSOs with a single temperature (e.g. natural rocks) versus human-made satellites with a chassis and deployed solar panels where significant component temperature differences exist under typical orbital configurations. Last, we comment on promising prospects of this model for applications to existing and future space telescope observations to characterize RSOs from spatially unresolved photometry",

Although it was widely observed from the Northern Hemisphere, it was first discovered by observers south of the Equator. The comet arrived just months before the widely anticipated apparition of Comet 1P/Halley and was significantly more spectacular. As a result, the two comets were confused, and many who, in later years, talked about how prominent Comet 1P/Halley was in 1910 were often remembering C/1910 A1. In this paper, we present the results of a detailed search through historical records and media publications in Aotearoa / New Zealand, to investigate how extensively C/1910 A1 was observed from New Zealand. We compare our results with observations reported for Comet 1P/Halley later in 1910, finding that surprisingly few observations of C/1910 A1 were made by New Zealand observers. We discuss cases where the comet was misidentified as being an early sighting of 1P/Halley and compare the observations made in New Zealand with international observations/records/accounts. We find that, although the Great January Comet of 1910 was observed from New Zealand, it was witnessed by few compared to other parts of the world, meaning that the apparition of C/1910 A1 was something of a missed opportunity for New Zealand astronomers.",

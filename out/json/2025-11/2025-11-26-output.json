        "abstract": "Supernova (SN) feedback-driven galactic outflows are a key physical process that contributes to the baryon cycle by regulating the star formation activity, reducing the amount of metals in low-mass galaxies and enriching the circumgalactic (CGM) and intergalactic media (IGM). We aim to understand the chemical loop of sub-Milky Way (MW) galaxies and their nearby regions. We studied 15 simulated central sub-MW galaxies (M* <= 10^10 Msun) and intermediate-mass galaxies (M* \\sim 10^10 Msun) from the CIELO-P7 high-resolution simulations. We followed the evolution of the progenitor galaxies, their properties and the characteristics of the outflows within the redshift range z = [0, 7]. We used two dynamically-motivated outflow definitions, unbound outflows and expelled mass rates, to quantify the impact of SN feedback. At z \\sim 0, sub-MW galaxies have a larger fraction of their current oxygen mass in the gas phase but have expelled a greater portion beyond the virial radius, compared to their higher-mass counterparts. Galaxies with M* <\\sim 10^9 Msun have 10-40 per cent of their total oxygen mass within R200 in the CGM, and an equivalent to 10-60 per cent expelled into the IGM. In contrast, more massive galaxies have most of the oxygen mass locked by the stellar populations. The CGM of low-mass galaxies predominantly contains oxygen low-temperature gas, acting as a metal reservoir. We find that the outflows are more oxygen-rich for sub-MW galaxies, Zout/ZISM \\sim 1.5, than for higher-mass galaxies, Zout/ZISM <= 0.5, particularly for z < 2. Mass-loading factors of eta_out \\sim 0 - 6 are detected in agreement with observations (abridged).",

Through James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) spectra and images from JWST and Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we identify a sample of 9 star-forming galaxies in the MQN01 field with detection of nebular emission lines ($\\rm H\\beta$, [OIII], $\\rm H\\alpha$, [NII]), covering the mass range of $\\rm 10^{7.5}M_\\odot - 10^{10.5}M_\\odot$.

These differences are decreased considering the ``Fundamental Metallicity Relation'', i.e. if the galaxies' Star Formation Rates (SFR) are also taken into account.

Two scenarios have been proposed to explain this trend: the earlier formation of higher-concentration haloes allows more time for star formation, or the deeper gravitational potential wells of higher-concentration haloes enhance baryon retention. To distinguish between them, we examine correlations between halo concentration, stellar mass, stellar age, and stellar metallicity. While, at fixed halo mass, halo concentration correlates with stellar age, stellar age itself shows only a weak correlation with stellar mass, indicating that early formation alone cannot account for the concentration-dependence in the scatter of the SMHM relation. In contrast, both stellar metallicity and halo concentration exhibit correlations with stellar mass. The connection between halo concentration and stellar metallicity persists even when simultaneously controlling for both halo mass and stellar mass. These results support the scenario in which the deeper gravitational potentials in higher-concentration haloes suppress feedback-driven outflows, thereby enhancing both baryon and metal retention.",

These compact, strongly star-forming galaxies serve as local analogs of high-redshift starbursts. Using high-resolution VLT/X-shooter spectra, we model the optical emission-line profiles, including [O III] 4959,5007 and the Balmer lines, with multi-component Gaussian fits. All galaxies show complex kinematics that require both narrow (sigma  90 km/s) components. The narrow components trace highly turbulent gas associated with massive star-forming regions, while the broad components indicate ionized outflows driven by stellar winds and supernova feedback, with outflow velocities of about 200-500 km/s. Estimated mass outflow rates range from 0.20 to 2.72 solar masses per year, with mass-loading factors between 0.03 and 0.81. We find a mild increase in mass loading toward lower stellar masses, as well as a strong correlation between mass loading and star-formation-rate surface density, suggesting that more compact starbursts drive more powerful outflows. These trends are consistent with those seen in star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts.

In this paper, we test the ability of SE3D to recover known intrinsic properties of toy model and TNG50 simulated galaxies from mock observations of their multi-wavelength photometric and structural properties. We find an encouraging performance for several key characteristics, including the bulk stellar mass, dust mass and SFR, as well as their respective radial extents. We point out limitations, and investigate the impact of various sources of model mismatch. Among them, mismatch in the shapes of star formation histories contributes most, with radial and azimuthal structure and stellar metallicity distributions playing a progressively more minor role. We also analyse the evolution from z=2 to z=0 of resolved stellar and dust properties of TNG galaxies, as measured intrinsically and expressed in their distribution across UVJ and IRX-$\\beta$ diagnostic diagrams. We test different methods to assign dust to the simulation, and find a persistent lack of Mdust/Mstar evolution and a more limited dynamic range across the diagnostic diagrams compared to observations.",

        "abstract": "The complex processes of baryonic feedback associated with galaxy evolution are still poorly understood, and their impact on the clustering of matter on small scales remains difficult to quantify. While many fitting functions and emulators exist to model the matter power spectrum, their input parameters are not directly observable. However, recent studies using hydrodynamical simulations have identified a promising correlation between the gas content of halos and changes to the matter power spectrum from feedback. Building on these findings, we create the first fully data-driven power spectrum emulator. We utilize the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect, a secondary anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background, as a tracer of free electrons in and around halos. We train a neural network to learn the mapping between the suppression of the matter power spectrum and the shape of the kSZ power spectrum extracted with a radial velocity template. We train and validate our algorithm using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, which encompasses a wide range of feedback models. Our emulator can reconstruct the matter power spectrum at the sub-percent level for scales $k\\leq 5\\;h/$Mpc and $0.2\\leq z \\leq 1.25$ directly from the data. Our model is robust and retains percent-level accuracy even for feedback models and cosmological parameter values not seen during training (except in a few extreme cases drastically different from the fiducial model). Due to its robustness, our algorithm offers a new way to identify the sources of suppression in the matter power spectrum, breaking the degeneracies between baryonic feedback and new physics. Finally, we present a forecast for reconstruction of the matter power spectrum combining maps of the microwave background anisotropies from a Simons Observatory-like experiment and galaxy catalogs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.",

The toy models vary in their stellar and dust geometries, and include radial stellar population gradients. The computationally efficient machine learning emulator uses a Bayesian neural network architecture, and reproduces the spectral distributions at an accuracy of ~ 0.05 dex or less across the dynamic range of input parameters, and across the rest-frame UVJ colour space spanned by observed galaxies. We carry out a sensitivity analysis demonstrating that the emulator has successfully learned the intricate mappings between galaxy physical properties and direct observables (fluxes, colours, sizes, size ratios between different wavebands, ...).

By measuring the half-mass radius (R$_{50}$) and half-mass height (z$_{50}$) across 1 Gyr-wide age bins, we trace the spatial evolution of stellar populations over cosmic time. All galaxies exhibit a remarkably constant disc thickness for all stars younger than ~6 Gyr, suggesting minimal secular heating and limited impact from environmental processes such as tidal shocking or harassment. Evidence of past mergers (8-10 Gyr ago) is found in the increase of z$_{50}$ for older populations. We find that accreted (metal-poor) stars have been deposited in quite thick configurations, but that the interactions only moderately thickened pre-existing stars in the galaxies, and only caused mild flaring in the outer regions of the discs. The radial structure of the discs varies across galaxies, but in all cases we find that the radial extent of mono-age populations remains constant or grows over the past 8 Gyr. This leads us to argue that within the radial range we consider, strangulation, rather than ram-pressure stripping, is the dominant quenching mechanism in those galaxies. Our results highlight the usefulness of analysing the structure of mono-age population to uncover the mechanisms driving galaxy evolution, and we anticipate broader insights from the GECKOS survey, studying 36 nearby edge-on disc galaxies.",

        "abstract": "The elevated UV luminosity functions (UVLF) from recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have challenged the viability of existing theoretical models. To address this, we use a semi-analytical framework -- which couples a physically motivated source model derived from radiative-transfer hydrodynamic simulations of reionization with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler -- to perform a joint calibration to JWST galaxy surveys (UVLF, $\\phi_{\\rm UV}$ and UV luminosity density, $\\rho_{\\rm UV}$) and reionization-era observables (ionizing emissivity, $\\dot{N}_{\\rm ion}$, neutral hydrogen fraction, $x_{\\rm HI}$, and Thomson optical depth, $\\tau$). We find that models with weak feedback and a higher contribution from faint galaxies reproduce the reionization observables but struggle to match the elevated JWST UVLF at $z > 9$. In contrast, models with stronger feedback (i.e., rapid redshift evolution) and a higher contribution from bright galaxies successfully reproduce JWST UVLF at $z \\geq 10$, but over-estimate the bright end at $z < 9$. The strong-feedback model constrained by JWST UVLF predicts a more gradual and extended reionization history, as opposed to the sudden reionization seen in the weak-feedback models. This extended nature of reionization ($z\\sim 16$ - $6$) yields an optical depth consistent (at 2-$\\sigma$) with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraint, thereby alleviating the photon-budget crisis. In both scenarios, reionization is complete by $z \\sim 6$, consistent with current data. Our analysis highlights the importance of accurately modeling feedback and ionizing emissivities from different source populations during the first billion years after the Big Bang.",

        "abstract": "Cosmological simulations predict significant secondary dependencies of halo clustering on internal properties and environment. Detecting these subtle signals in observational data remains challenging, with important ramifications for galaxy evolution and cosmology. We probe secondary halo bias in observational survey data, using galaxy groups as dark matter halo proxies. We quantify secondary bias using central galaxy colour and environmental diagnostics. We use an extended, refined galaxy group catalogue from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Secondary bias is defined as any deviation in group clustering strength at fixed mass, quantified through the projected two-point correlation function. Our environmental analysis uses DisPerSE to compute distances to critical points of the density field, incorporating local group overdensity measurements on multiple scales. We robustly detect several forms of secondary bias in the clustering of galaxy groups. At fixed mass, groups hosting red central galaxies are more strongly clustered than those with blue centrals, with $b_{\\rm relative}$ ranging from $\\sim 1.2$ for the 15\\% reddest centrals to $\\sim 0.8$ for the bluest ones. Environmental dependencies based on cosmic-web distances are also present, though significantly weaker and largely mass-independent. The strongest signal arises from local overdensity: groups in the densest 15\\% of environments reach $b_{\\rm relative} \\sim 1.4$, while those in the least dense regions fall to $b_{\\rm relative} \\sim 0.7$. These results establish a clear observational hierarchy for secondary halo bias. The colour of central galaxies correlates with the local group overdensity, which, in turn, correlates with the bias at fixed group mass. Assuming that central galaxy colour traces halo assembly history, this three-stage picture offers a conceptual link between our results and halo assembly bias.",

Unlike conventional methods, our approach delivers high-resolution reconstructions of all major physical components of the lensing system and substantially reduces model-data residuals compared to previous work. For the majority of 30 lensing systems analyzed, we also provide posterior samples capturing the full uncertainty of each physical model parameter. The reconstructions of the background sources reveal high significance morphological structures as small as 200 parsecs in galaxies at redshifts of z 0.5-1.0, demonstrating the power of strong lensing and the analysis method to be used as a cosmic telescope to study the high redshift universe.

Our implementation modifies the governing equations of SPMHD to allow the constrained hyperbolic/parabolic cleaning scheme to be applied consistently in an expanding cosmological framework. This ensures that divergence errors in the magnetic field are actively propagated away and damped, rather than merely being advected with the flow or partially controlled by source terms. To validate our implementation, we perform a series of standard test problems, including the advection of divergence errors, the Orszag-Tang vortex, the Brio-Wu shock tube, and magnetised Zeldovich pancakes. These tests confirm that our scheme successfully reduces divergence errors while preserving the correct physical evolution of the system.   We then apply the method to a fully cosmological simulation of a massive galaxy cluster, comparing the results to those obtained using the previously employed Powell eight-wave divergence preserving scheme. We find that the overall density structure of the cluster is largely unaffected by the choice of divergence cleaning method, and the magnetic field geometry and strengths in the cluster core remain similar. However, in the cluster outskirts ($r \\approx$~1-3~$h^{-1}$~Mpc), the magnetic field is amplified by a factor of $\\sim$ 5 compared to the Powell-only approach. Moreover, the constrained divergence cleaning algorithm reduces the divergence error by 2-3 orders of magnitude throughout the cluster volume, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining the solenoidal condition of the magnetic field in large-scale cosmological simulations.

In this work, we present the first UV line-selected ([Nev]3426 and CIV1549) sample of obscured AGN with full X-ray-to-radio coverage, assembled by combining data from the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey, the COSMOS2020 catalogue, IR photometry from XID+, and radio observations from the VLA and MIGHTEE surveys.

We find that X-ray and radio data are essential for accurate SED fits, with the radio band proving critical when X-ray detections are missing or in cases of poor IR coverage. Comparisons with matched non-active galaxies and simulations suggest that the [NeV]-selected sources are in a pre-quenching stage, while the CIV-selected ones are likely quenched by AGN activity.

Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discoveries have unveiled an abundance of faint and massive Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at high redshifts (z=4-9), that surpass by 10 to 100 times the extrapolated bolometric (Bol) and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions (LF) from previous AGN campaigns. The two main models that are put forward to explain these observations correspond to light seeds (150 Msol) accreting in episodes of super Eddington, and heavy seeds ($10^3$ - $10^5$ Msol) growing at the Eddington limit. Future gravitational observatories like the Laser Interferometer Satellite Antenna (LISA) will help disentangle these models by reporting the BH-BH merger events from mid to high redshifts. Aims. This work aims to report the predicted merger rates in the heavy seed scenario in light of recent JWST data. In our models we explore (i) instantaneous merging between BHs, (ii) delayed merging after a dynamical timescale, as well as extreme spin configurations (a=0.99, a=-0.99) to bracket BH mass growth. Methods. We use Delphi, a semi-analytical model that tracks baryonic physics over a hierarchical evolution of dark matter halos through cosmic time within the first billion years of the Universe. We calibrate this model for it to simultaneously reproduce galaxy and JWST-AGNs observables. Results. We show reasonable agreement with the Bolometric Luminosity function at z=6, where BHs must accrete 10-100 times more gas than in previous works calibrated to pre-JWST data. However, we underpredict (overpredict) the bright end $10^45.5$ erg s$^-1$ (all luminosity range) at z=7 (z=5) by 1-3.2 dex (0.22-1.6 dex). Regarding BH-BH merger events, the instantaneous (delayed) models predict a total of 28.06 (19.61) yr$^-1$ for BHs at z>=5, which is within the range of merger rates reported in previous literature.",

        "abstract": "The enrichment history of galaxy clusters and groups remains far from being fully understood. Recent measurements in massive clusters have revealed remarkably flat iron abundance profiles out to the outskirts, suggesting that similar enrichment processes have occurred for all systems. In contrast, abundance profiles in galaxy groups have sometimes been measured to decline with radius, challenging our understanding of the physical processes at these scales. In this paper, we present a pilot study aimed at accurately measuring the iron abundance profiles of MKW3s, A2589, and Hydra A, three poor clusters with total masses of $M_{500} \\simeq 2.0-2.5 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_\\odot$, intermediate between the scales of galaxy groups and massive clusters. Using XMM-Newton to obtain nearly complete azimuthal coverage of the outer regions of these systems, we show that abundance measurements in the outskirts are more likely to be limited by systematics than by statistical errors. In particular, inaccurate modelling of the soft X-ray background can significantly bias metallicity estimates in regions where the cluster emission is faint. Once these systematics are properly accounted for, the abundance profiles of all three clusters appear to be flat at $Z \\sim 0.3$ Z$_{\\odot}$, in agreement with values observed in massive clusters. Using available stellar mass estimates, we also computed their iron yields, thereby beginning to probe a largely unexplored mass range. We find $Y_{Fe,500} = 2.68\\pm0.34$, $2.54\\pm0.64$, and $7.51\\pm1.47$ Z$_{\\odot}$ for MKW3s, A2589, and Hydra A, respectively, spanning the transition regime between galaxy groups and massive clusters. Future observations of systems with temperatures of $2-4$ keV will be essential to further populate this intermediate-mass regime and to draw firmer conclusions on the chemical enrichment history of galaxy systems across the full mass scale.",

Results have claimed that these BHs are significantly more massive than expected from the BH mass-host galaxy stellar mass relation derived from the local Universe. We present a comprehensive census of the BH populations in the early Universe through a detailed stacking analysis of galaxy populations, binned by luminosity and redshift, using JWST spectroscopy from the CEERS, JADES, RUBIES, and GLASS extragalactic deep field surveys. Broad H$\\alpha$ detections in $31\\%$ of the stacked spectra (5/16 bins) imply median BH masses of $10^{5.21} - 10^{6.13}~ \\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ and the stacked SEDs of these bins indicate median stellar masses of $10^{7.84} - 10^{8.56} ~\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$. This suggests that the median galaxy hosts a BH that is at most a factor of 10 times over-massive compared to its host galaxy and lies closer to the locally derived $M_{BH}-M_*$ relation. We investigate the seeding properties of the inferred BHs and find that they can be well-explained by a light stellar remnant seed undergoing moderate Eddington accretion. Our results indicate that individual detections of AGN are more likely to sample the upper envelope of the $M_{BH}-M_*$ distribution, while stacking on ``normal\" galaxies and searching for AGN signatures can overcome the selection bias of individual detections.",

We find N-emitters from redshift $z\\sim 3-11$ among a broad diversity of galaxies, in terms of morphology, UV magnitude, stellar mass, SFR, metallicity, and rest-optical line strengths. The UV nitrogen lines show typical equivalent widths between $\\sim 5-50$ \\AA. Carbon lines are generally fainter than the N lines. Using strong line calibrations established at high-redshift, we find metallicities $12+log(O/H)\\sim 7.15-8.5$, including thus also high metallicities. The H$\\beta$ equivalent width of N-emitters varies strongly, and sources with low EWs show clear signs of a Balmer break, indicative of composite stellar populations combining both young ( 0.5$), independently of metallicity. The observed abundance ratios are compatible with ejecta from H-burning and do not show signs of Carbon enhancements, even at higher metallicities. Finally, we find that the fraction of N-emitters increases with redshift, and we quantify this evolution. Our study increases the sample of known N-emitters by a factor $\\sim 3$, reveals a diversity of properties among N-emitters, and provides new constraints on their nature.",

        "abstract": "We present the first detection of the cosmological 21 cm intensity mapping signal in auto-correlation at z ~ 1 with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). Using 94 nights of observation, we have measured the 21 cm auto-power spectrum over a frequency range from 608.2 MHz to 707.8 MHz (z = 1.34 to 1.01) at 0.4 h Mpc^-1 < k < 1.5 h Mpc^-1, with a detection significance of 12.5 sigma. Our analysis employs significant improvements to the CHIME data processing pipeline compared to previous work, including novel radio frequency interference (RFI) detection and masking algorithms, achromatic beamforming techniques, and foreground filtering before time averaging to minimize spectral leakage. We establish the robustness and reliability of our detection through a comprehensive suite of validation tests. We also measure the 21 cm signal in two independent sub-bands centered at z ~ 1.08 and z ~ 1.24 with detection significance of 8.7 sigma and 9.2 sigma, respectively. We briefly discuss the theoretical interpretation of these measurements in terms of a power spectrum model, deferring the details to a companion paper. This auto-power spectrum detection demonstrates CHIME's capability to probe large-scale structure through 21 cm intensity mapping without reliance on external galaxy surveys.",

Aims: Our aim is to investigate whether LISA can resolve WD binaries in GCs well enough in terms of sky location and distance that they can be distinguished from binaries in the MW disc.   Methods: We used a sample of 20 of the most massive GCs around the MW and simulated LISA's sky location and distance measurement errors for WD binaries in these GCs using the software package GWToolbox. We did this in the context of a model of the LISA-detectable binaries in the MW from the population synthesis code SeBa.   Results: We find that for five of the GCs in our sample, binaries in the GC could be easily distinguished from MW disc binaries using the sky location alone; for another five, binaries in the GCs could be distinguished using a combination of LISA's sky location and distance measurements; and for the final ten, binaries in the GCs could not be distinguished from overlapping MW disc binaries. The results depend strongly on the sky locations of the GCs, with GCs far away from the Galactic plane being easy to resolve, while GCs close to the Galactic centre overlap with many MW disc binaries. The most promising GC for finding a WD binary that could be resolved to that GC, based on sky location and GC mass, is 47 Tucanae.",

        "abstract": "Context. Neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) absorption lines can be used to probe the cold neutral medium (CNM) at high Galactic latitudes. Cold HI with a significant optical depth from the GASKAP-HI survey is found to be located predominantly if not exclusively within filamentary structures that can be identified as caustics with the Hessian operator. Most of these HI filaments (57%) are also observable in the far-infrared (FIR) and trace the orientation of magnetic field lines. Aims. We considered whether molecular hydrogen (H2) might also be preferentially associated with CNM filaments. Methods. We analyzed 241 H2 absorption lines against stars and determined whether the lines of sight intersected HI or FIR filaments. Using Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) H2 data in the velocity range -50 < vLSR < 50 km/s, we traced 65 additional H2 lines for filamentary HI and FIR structures in velocity and probed the H2 absorption for coincidences in position and velocity. Results. For 305 out of 306 positions, the lines of sight with H2 absorption intersect HI filaments. In 120 cases, there is also evidence for a correlation with dusty FIR filaments. All of the 65 available sight lines with known velocities intersect HI filaments. In 64 cases, the H2 velocities are consistent with HI filament velocities. For FIR filaments, an agreement is found for only 13 out of 14 H2 absorption lines. Conclusions. For the majority of H2 absorption lines, there is evidence that H2 is associated with cold HI filaments. Evidence of an association with FIR filaments is less compelling. Confusion along the line of sight limits the detectability of FIR filaments. For a comparable degree of UV excitation in the disk and lower Galactic halo, the formation rate of H2 appears to be enhanced in HI filaments with increased CNM densities.",

Furthermore, we conducted resonant photoexcitation spectroscopy of highly charged ions using the soft X-ray beamline BL17SU at the synchrotron radiation facility SPring-8.

        "abstract": "Identification of electromagnetic emission in coincidence with high-energy neutrinos is fundamentally important for multimessenger astronomy. Such observations are essential for constraining source localization, determining the source type, and understanding emission mechanisms. Typically, they require following up a neutrino alert (IceCube issues two alert streams: Gold, with at least 50 percent probability of astrophysical origin, and Bronze, with at least 30 percent probability) with an electromagnetic facility, primarily in X-ray and gamma-ray bands. Another approach involves electromagnetic monitoring of hot spots in the IceCube skymap, i.e., positions exceeding the instrument sensitivity. An alternative method consists in performing correlation analysis across available neutrino events and source catalogs. We searched for spatial coincidence between galaxies from SDSS and high-energy neutrino events. The analysis includes IceCube Gold alerts and neutrino-electromagnetic coincidence events from AMON (Astrophysical Multimessenger Observatory Network), identified through the end of September 2025. We examined galaxies from the morphological catalog at redshifts 0.02 to 0.1, which contains 315,776 SDSS DR9 objects with absolute stellar magnitudes in the range from -24 to -13 in the r band. Among 59 IceCube Gold alerts, we found three with only one galaxy (SDSS J231231.52+033415.1) within the 50 percent containment radius. Among 24 neutrino-electromagnetic coincidence events, three more contain only one galaxy (SDSS J220711.14+122535.9) within the same radius. These six galaxies represent the most promising candidates for potential host galaxies of neutrino sources.

We retrieve a temperature structure which is more isothermal than models and investigate its impact on our measurements, finding that constraining the temperature structure to self-consistent models does not significantly impact our retrieved chemical properties.

Recent studies, however, indicate that galaxy clusters occupy a parallel but offset relation, raising questions about the universality of the BTFR. Here, we demonstrate that the offset between galaxies and clusters arises naturally from cosmic time evolution. Using the evolving BTFR derived from the Nexus Paradigm of quantum gravity, we show that the normalization of the relation evolves as an exponential function of cosmic time., while the slope remains fixed at $\\sim 4$. This provides a simple and predictive framework in which both galaxies and clusters obey the same universal scaling law, with their apparent offset reflecting their different formation epochs. Our results unify mass- velocity scaling across five orders of magnitude in baryonic mass, offering new insights into cosmic structure formation.",

The analysis reveals this target is an eclipsing binary system with $\\delta$ Scuti type pulsations from the primary component, rather than from the secondary as previously reported. The frequency analysis of three short-cadence data reveals 41 significant frequencies, including the orbital frequency ($f_{orb}$ = 0.827198 d$^{-1}$) due to orbital motion from binary system and the pulsational frequencies. Most of the pulsational signal lies in the frequency range of 20 - 32 d$^{-1}$, with amplitude between 0.3 and 8.8 mmag, in which seven peaks are identified as `independent' modes. The strongest one ($f_{3}$ = 28.499399 d$^{-1}$) likely corresponds to a high-order radial mode. In other peaks ($f_{7}$, $f_{10}$, and $f_{18}$), several pairs of multiplet structures centered on them are found. The fitting of spectral energy distribution (SED) using the collected photometry measurement of multiple bands reveals the effective temperatures of the primary and secondary components as $8348^{+230}_{-225}$~K and $4753^{+237}_{-229}$~K, respectively, which place the primary star in the classical pulsating instability zone. The characteristic light curve morphology and short orbital period are consistent with a tidally locked system. Based on the characteristics of amplitude spectra of pulsating stars in close binaries, the analysis of the multiplet structures reveals that three independent frequencies (i.e. $f_{7}$, $f_{10}$, and $f_{18}$) correspond to non-radial modes with $l = 2$, while the associated sidelobes are produced by the orbital motion. We highlight the potential of this method in future studies of pulsating binary stars.",

Establishing the thermal history from the early radiation era to the present, the fermions are shown to behave like standard radiation at high temperatures, but then experience a critical era decaying faster than radiation, akin to freeze-out that sets the relic abundance. Through a second-order phase transition, fermion - antifermion pairs condense and the system asymptotes towards zero temperature and pressure. By the present era, the non-relativistic, massive condensate decays slightly faster than in the standard scenario -- a unique prediction that may be tested by combined measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure. We also show that in the case of massive fermions, the phase transition is frustrated, and freeze-out instead leaves a residual, long-lived",

Compared to traditional methods (parametric Moffat, ePSF template-based, and regularized likelihood), we demonstrate that our PSF models achieve orders of magnitude higher likelihood and residuals consistent with noise, all while remaining visually realistic. Further, the method applies even for faint and heavily masked point sources, merely producing a broader posterior. By recovering a realistic, pixel-level posterior distribution, our technique enables the first meaningful propagation of detailed PSF morphological uncertainty in downstream analysis.

        "abstract": "The James Webb Space Telescope has recently detected massive, fully formed, galaxies at redshifts corresponding to few hundred million years after the Big-Bang. However, our current cosmological model cannot produce such massive systems so early in the lifetime of the universe. A number of theoretical solutions have been proposed, but they all appeal to exotic new physics and introduce rather excessive fine-tuning. In this essay, we outline a theoretical answer to the early galaxy-formation question, which operates within standard general relativity and standard cosmology, without appealing to any new physics. Instead, we account for the effect of a well established feature of our universe. This feature, which has so far been kept in the margins of mainstream cosmology, are the peculiar velocities.",

        "abstract": "Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) are a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), commonly associated with rapidly accreting, relatively low-mass black holes ($10^6$ - $10^8 M_\\odot$) hosted in spiral galaxies. Although typically considered to have high Eddington ratios, recent observations, particularly of $\\gamma$-ray-emitting NLSy1s, have raised questions about their true black hole masses, with some estimates approaching those of Broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLSy1) systems. In this work, we present the recalibrated mass estimations for a large sample of NLSy1s galaxies with z $<0.8$. We apply the damped random walk (DRW) formalism to a comparison set of 1,141 NLSy1 and 1,143 BLSy1 galaxies, matched in redshift and bolometric luminosity using SDSS DR17 spectroscopy. Our analysis employs a multivariate calibration that incorporates both the Eddington ratio and the rest-frame wavelength to refine the mass estimates. We obtain median DRW-based black hole masses of $\\text{log}(M_{\\text{BH}}^{\\text{DRW}}/M_\\odot) = 6.25 \\pm 0.65$ for NLSy1s and $7.07 \\pm 0.67$ for BLSy1s, in agreement with their respective virial mass distributions. Furthermore, we identify strong inverse trends between the variability amplitude and both optical luminosity and FeII emission strength, consistent with a scenario where higher accretion rates suppress long-term optical variability. These findings reinforce the view that NLSy1s harbor smaller black holes and highlight the value of variability-based approaches in tracing AGN accretion properties.",

        "abstract": "We quantify the bias caused by small simulation box size on weak lensing observables and covariances, considering both replication and super-sample effects for a range of higher-order statistics. Using two simulation suites -- one comprising large boxes ($3750\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$) and another constructed by tiling small boxes ($625\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$) -- we generate full-sky convergence maps and extract $10^\\circ \\times 10^\\circ$ patches via a Fibonacci grid. We consider biases in the mean and covariance of the angular power spectrum, bispectrum (up to $\\ell=3000$), PDF, peak/minima counts, and Minkowski functionals. By first identifying lines of sight that are impacted by replications, we find that replication causes a O$(10\\%)$ bias in the PDF and Minkowski functionals, and a O$(1\\%)$ bias in other summary statistics. Replication also causes a O$(10\\%)$ bias in the covariances, increasing with source redshift and $\\ell$, reaching $\\sim25\\%$ for $z_s=2.5$. We additionally show that replication leads to heavy biases (up to O$(100\\%)$ at high redshift) when performing gnomonic projection on a patch that is centered along a direction of replication. We then identify the lines of sight that are minimally affected by replication, and use the corresponding patches to isolate and study super-sample effects, finding that, while the mean values agree to within $1\\%$, the variances differ by O$(10\\%)$ for $z_s\\leq2.5$. We show that these effects remain in the presence of noise and smoothing scales typical of the DES, KiDS, HSC, LSST, Euclid, and Roman surveys. We also discuss how these effects scale as a function of box size. Our results highlight the importance of large simulation volumes for accurate lensing statistics and covariance estimation.",

We assess dataset representativeness using UMAP analysis, confirming broad and consistent coverage of feature space. An XGBoost classifier, with hyperparameters tuned using automated optimization, is trained using purely photometric data (60-band J-PAS magnitudes) and combined photometric and morphological features, with performance thoroughly evaluated via ROC and purity-completeness metrics. Incorporating morphology significantly improves classification, outperforming the baseline classifications available in the catalogs. Permutation importance analysis reveals morphological parameters, particularly concentration, normalized peak surface brightness, and PSF, alongside photometric features around 4000 and 6900 A, as crucial for accurate classifications. We release a value-added catalog with our models for star-galaxy classification, enhancing the utility of miniJPAS and J-NEP for subsequent cosmological and astrophysical analyses.",

Using a model setup in which a wave with constant frequency is injected from past null infinity and scattered by the star to future null infinity, we show that the scattering coefficient encodes rich information of the star. For example, the analytical structure of the scattering coefficient implies that the decay rate of a mode generally plays the role of ``star excitation factor'', similar to the ``black hole excitation factor'' previously defined for describing black hole mode excitations. With this star excitation factor we derive the transient mode excitation as a binary system crosses a generic mode resonance of a companion star during the inspiral stage. This application is useful because previous description of resonant mode excitation of stars still relies on the mode and driving force decomposition based on the Newtonian formalism. In addition, we show that the scattering phase is intimately related to the total energy of spacetime and matter under the driving of a steady input wave from infinity. We also derive the relevant tidal energy of a star under steady driving and compare that with the dynamic tide formula. We estimate that the difference may lead to $\\mathcal{O}(0.5)$ radian phase modulation in the late stage of the binary neutron star inspiral waveform.",

This solution requires that the companion star of the exploding white dwarf must be a red giant star with a heavy stellar wind. This has been tested for 189 normal SNIa, with all tested systems being proven to not have the required red giant: (A) Zero-out-of-9 normal type Ia supernova remnants have any red giant ex-companion star near the center with limits of $M_V$$>$0.0. (B) Zero-out-of-2 normal SNIa in nearby galaxies have any red giant at the position as seen in archival pre-eruption images by HST to limits of $M_V$$>$0.0. (C and D) Zero-out-of-111 normal SNIa have any detected hydrogen or helium emission lines in their eruption spectra, with limits on entrained gas of $M_{\\rm H}$$<$0.22 and $M_{\\rm He}$$<$0.07 M$_{\\odot}$, which is the minimum mass lost by a red giant in a nearby blastwave. (E and F) Zero-out-of-9 nearby normal SNIa were detected in the radio or X-rays, as required from the ejecta/wind impact, to limits of $\\dot{M}_{\\rm wind}$$$$-$18, as required for a red giant companion when we are looking down its shadowcone. With zero-out-of-189 normal SNIa having any possibility of having a red giant companion, the fraction of SNIa with symbiotic progenitors is $<$0.53%. The overwhelming conclusion is that normal SNIa are not from symbiotic-progenitors in any measurable fraction.",

A small portion of the ATCA data was previously used to determine a time delay and our result is consistent with the previous value, but with an uncertainty that is smaller by more than a factor of two. The long time-baseline of the monitoring reveals that the flux density ratio is smoothly varying on a time-scale of years, an effect which we attribute to millilensing by massive objects (>>1 M_sun) in the lensing galaxy. Image A is unpolarized in the VLA monitoring, but VLBI observations show that this is partly due to beam dilution by an unpolarized counter-jet that is only present in that image. Based on the identification of this feature as a counter-jet, we conclude that its unexpected prominence in image A is a consequence of lensing and that more detailed modelling is required in order to reconcile the VLBI morphology of each image.",

The model contains a Dirac DM particle $\\chi$, three heavy neutrinos $N_I$ with masses $M_{N,I}$, and a singlet scalar $R$ that mixes with the Standard Model Higgs doublet $\\Phi$ by an angle $\\alpha$. A symmetry forbids the $\\Phi$-$R$ portal at tree level; the leading portal then arises at one loop from the same Yukawa structures that generate active neutrino masses $m_{\\nu,I}$, implying $\\tan(2\\alpha) \\propto \\sum_I m_{\\nu,I} M^2_{N,I}/(v_h m_H^2)$, where $v_h$ and $m_H$ are the SM Higgs VEV and mass. For heavy-neutrino masses in the multi-TeV range, this yields a naturally tiny mixing, $\\tan(2\\alpha)\\sim 5\\times 10^{-11}\\left(M_N/10~\\mathrm{TeV}\\right)^2$, which strongly suppresses DM signals in direct, indirect, and collider searches. For PeV-scale heavy neutrinos the DM-nucleon cross section can instead enter the reach of direct-detection experiments. The visible and dark sectors thermalize at temperatures of order a few times the mass of the lightest heavy neutrino, then subsequently decouple, and typically evolve with a slightly hotter dark bath. In the secluded regime, with $\\tan(2\\alpha)\\ll 1$ and $m_\\chi>m_{H_p}$, the relic density is set by $p$-wave annihilation $\\chi\\bar\\chi \\to H_p H_p$ (with $H_p$ the Higgs-like particle of the dark sector), and the dark-sector Yukawa couplings required to reproduce the observed abundance are $\\sim(0.1\\text{-}1)$, as in the standard WIMP case. For heavy-neutrino masses $\\gtrsim 10~\\mathrm{TeV}$, the mediator decays before nucleosynthesis without spoiling BBN observables, while the tiny portal suppresses present-day signals below current and near-future sensitivities. This links two long-standing puzzles, the absence of DM signals and the smallness of neutrino masses, within a predictive thermal framework.",

The properties of the phase transition and the resulting gravitational wave spectrum are determined by five key parameters: the nucleation temperature $T_n$, phase transition strength at the nucleation temperature $\\alpha_n$, bubble wall speed $v_\\text{wall}$, transition rate $\\beta$ and the sound speed $c_s$. Of these, the sound speed $c_s$ is determined by the equation of state $p(T,\\phi)$. In most studies, the plasma of the early universe has been assumed to be ultrarelativistic and therefore following the bag equation of state with $c_s = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.   In this thesis, the PTtools simulation framework for first-order phase transitions, based on the Sound Shell Model, has been extended to include support for arbitrary equations of state and therefore for a temperature- and phase-dependent sound speed $c_s(T,\\phi)$. The thesis also functions as a reference manual for PTtools. The framework has been tested with the constant sound speed model, in which the sound speed is a different constant in each phase. The sound speed has been shown to have a significant effect on the resulting gravitational wave spectrum, especially when changing the sound speed results in a change in the type of the solution. This has laid the groundwork for simulating cosmological phase transitions with realistic equations of state. This will result in in gravitational wave spectra that can be used in the LISA data analysis pipeline to search for the existence and parameters of a first-order phase transition in the early universe.",

        "abstract": "We report the first detection in space of propadienone, the linear isomer (l-H$_2$C$_3$O) of cyclopropenone (c-H$_2$C$_3$O). We also report the first detection of the isotopologue c-H$_2$$^{13}$CCCO, and c-HDCCCO of c-H$_2$C$_3$O. The astronomical observations are part of QUIJOTE, a line survey of TMC-1 in the frequency range 31.0-50.3 GHz, complemented with data between 71.6-116.0 GHz, and carried out with Yebes-40m and IRAM-30m telescopes, respectively. We obtain a total column density of 3.7$\\times$10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ for l-H$_2$C$_3$O at an excitation temperature of 4.8 K. We find that the isomer is about eight times less abundant than the cyclic one. We also report a detailed line-by-line study of cyclopropenethione (c-H$_2$C$_3$S) to compare the abundance of the O and S isomers. We find that cyclic O-isomers are more abundant than cyclic S-isomers; however, the opposite trend is found for the most stable linear isomers, with l-H$_2$C$_3$S being more than one order of magnitude more abundant than l-H$_2$C$_3$O. A comprehensive theoretical chemical analysis shows that the abundances of the H$_2$C$_3$O and H$_2$C$_3$S isomers are controlled by different formation pathways. In particular, while l-H$_2$C$_3$O is potentially produced by dissociative electron recombination reactions, ion-neutral chemistry is more effective at producing l-H$_2$C$_3$S and c-H$_2$C$_3$S.",

        "abstract": "Strange quark matter (SQM) is considered a possible true ground state of QCD at high densities. This idea motivates research on exotic compact objects and certain cosmic-ray phenomena. For instance, the remnant HESS J1731-347 contains a low-mass neutron star, about $0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$ $M_\\odot$ and $10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km in radius, making it a strong candidate for a strange quark star. Other events, such as GW170817 and GRB 250702B, provide conditions that may favor the formation of strangelets. Strangelets are stable clusters of SQM, potentially created during the phase transition between the 2SC and CFL color-superconducting states. These clusters could generate monochromatic $\\gamma$-ray lines in very-high-energy spectra through self-annihilation. This work analyzes the stability of strangelets, production cross-sections, and mass-to-charge ratios using QCD-based models. Data from H.E.S.S., Fermi-LAT, MAGIC-II, and CTA were used to set limits on spectral features and possible fluxes. Detecting narrow $\\gamma$-ray lines will require improved instrument sensitivity. By integrating evidence from multimessenger astrophysics and dense QCD simulations, this study investigates the equations of state for compact stars and explores the potential cosmological influence of SQM.",

        "abstract": "Primordial Magnetic Fields (PMFs) -- magnetic fields originating in the early Universe and permeating the cosmological scales today -- can explain the observed microGauss-level magnetisation of galaxies and their clusters. In light of current and upcoming all-sky radio surveys, PMFs have drawn attention not only as major candidates for explaining the large-scale magnetisation of the Universe, but also as potential probes of early-Universe physics. In this paper, using cosmological simulations coupled with light-cone analysis, we study for the first time the imprints of the PMF structure on the mean rotation measure (RM) originating in the intergalactic medium (IGM), $\\langle \\mathrm{RM_{IGM}}\\rangle$. We introduce a new method for producing full-sky $\\mathrm{RM_{IGM}}$ distributions and analyse the autocorrelation of $\\mathrm{RM_{IGM}}$ on small and large angular scales; we find that PMF structures indeed show distinct signatures. The large-scale uniform model (characterised by an initially unlimited coherence scale) leads to correlations up to 90 degrees, while correlations for small-scale stochastic PMF models drop by factor of $100$ at $ 0.17, 0.13$ and 0.11 degrees angular scales, corresponding to $5.24, 4.03$ and $3.52$ Mpc scales (at $z=2$ redshift) for magnetic fields with comoving $3.49, 1.81, 1.00 $ Mpc/h coherence scales, respectively; the correlation amplitude of the PMF model with comoving $\\sim 19$ Mpc/h coherence scale drops only by factor of $10$ at 1 degree (30.6 Mpc). These results suggests that improvements in the modelling of Galactic RM will be necessary to investigate the signature of large-scale correlated PMFs. A comparison of $\\langle \\mathrm{RM_{IGM}}\\rangle$ redshift dependence obtained from our simulations with that from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey shows agreement with our previous upper limits' estimates on the PMF strength derived from RM-rms analysis.",

Blazars, a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets pointed close to our line of sight, offer a unique view into jet dynamics. Blazar $\\gamma$-ray light curves exhibit rapid, high-amplitude flares that point to promising alternative dissipation mechanisms such as magnetic reconnection. This study uses three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) and resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (ResRMHD) simulations with the PLUTO code to explore magnetic reconnection in turbulent, magnetized plasma columns. Focusing on current-driven kink instabilities, we identify the formation of current sheets due to magnetic reconnection, leading to plasmoid formation. We develop a novel technique combining hierarchical structure analysis and reconnection diagnostics to identify reconnecting current sheets. A statistical analysis of their geometry and orientation reveals a smaller subset that aligns closely with the jet axis, consistent with the jet-in-jet model. These structures can generate relativistically moving plasmoids with significant Doppler boosting, offering a plausible mechanism for the fast flares superimposed on slowly varying blazar light curves. These findings provide new insights into the plasma dynamics of relativistic jets and strengthen the case for magnetic reconnection as a key mechanism in blazar $\\gamma$-ray variability.",

Current PTA analyses generally assume circular binaries; however, dynamical interactions with the surrounding environment can prevent complete circularisation, allowing SMBHBs to retain appreciable eccentricities. In this work, we present a gravitational waveform model for eccentric binaries based on the Effective-One-Body (EOB) formalism, designed for continuous GW searches in PTA data. The model is accurate up to the second post-Newtonian (2PN) order for the conservative dynamics and up to post-leading order for the radiation-reaction terms. We provide both a numerically precise and a computationally efficient approximate implementation and evaluate the latter's accuracy against the full model over a broad range of eccentricities and initial orbital frequencies. Our results show that a substantial region of the parameter space exhibits pronounced orbital evolution, much stronger than in the circular case. We demonstrate the rich harmonic structure of timing residuals induced by eccentric GWs. Properly characterising eccentric binaries is an essential step toward detecting GWs in PTA data and interpreting the results, ultimately improving our understanding of the supermassive black hole population in the local Universe.",

Previous studies have not considered the influence of the magnetic field within the Crab Nebula. The magnetic field plays a crucial role through the Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) process, in which high-energy electrons produce synchrotron radiation that is subsequently up-scattered by the same electrons via inverse Compton scattering to generate gamma rays. Therefore, neglecting the magnetic field in modeling leads to theoretical inconsistencies. In this work, we investigate the significance of the magnetic field effect and demonstrate that even differences in magnetic field modeling can substantially alter the conversion probability. We thus, for the first time, point out that proper consideration of the magnetic field is essential in ALP searches using gamma rays from the Crab Nebula. The resulting constraints reach up to a coupling of $g_{a\\gamma \\gamma} \\lesssim 1 \\times 10^{-11} {\\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses in the range $10^{-10} {\\rm eV} \\lesssim m_a \\lesssim 10^{-6} {\\rm eV}$.",

These processes may compress nearby regions, triggering further star formation, but the significance of triggered star formation across the Galactic disc is not well understood. This pilot study combines 1.3 GHz continuum data from the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS) with 13CO (2-1) data from the Structure, Excitation, and Dynamics of the Inner Galactic Interstellar Medium (SEDIGISM) survey to identify and examine molecular clouds associated with H II regions and supernovae remnants (SNRs). We focus on their physical properties and massive star formation potential. We identify 268 molecular clouds from the SEDIGISM tile covering the Galactic plane region between 341 and 343 longitude deg and latitude deg equal to or less 0.5, of which 90 clouds (34 per cent) are associated with SMGPS extended sources. Compared to unassociated clouds, we find that associated clouds exhibit significantly higher mean mass (9600 solMass vs. 2500 solMass ) and average gas surface density (104 solMass / pc^2 vs. 67 solMass / pc^2 ), and slightly elevated but comparable virial parameters. We also find that the size-linewidth scaling relation is steeper for associated clouds compared to unassociated clouds. In addition, radio luminosity shows a positive correlation with total complex mass, and the ratio L_radio/L_complex increases with source size, consistent with an evolutionary sequence where expanding H II regions progressively disrupt their natal molecular environment. These findings suggest an enhanced dynamical activity for the associated clouds and support the hypothesis that feedback from massive stars influences molecular cloud properties and may trigger star formation.",

Two mechanisms are commonly invoked to explain their origin, the binary supernova scenario (BSS) and the dynamical ejection scenario (DES). Investigating the kinematic properties of runaway stars is key to understanding their origins.We intend to investigate the origins of 39 B-type runaway stars from LAMOST using orbital traceback analysis. From the catalog of LAMOST, we selected 39 B-type runaway stars and determined their spectral subtypes from key absorption lines. We then derived atmospheric parameters for each star using the Stellar Label Machine (SLAM), which is trained on TLUSTY synthetic spectra computed under the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) assumption. Using the derived atmospheric parameters as input, we estimated stellar masses and ages with a machine learning model trained on PARSEC evolutionary tracks. We finally performed orbital traceback with GALPY to analyze their origins. Through orbital traceback, we find that 29 stars have trajectories entirely within the Galactic disk, whereas 10 are disk-passing yet still trace back to the disk. Two stars have trajectories that intersect those of known clusters. Their orbits show similar morphologies in both the $X-Y$ and $R-Z$ planes, and their [M/H] values are comparable, suggesting possible cluster origins. However, definitive confirmation will require additional evidence. In addition, the $V_{\\rm Sp} - v\\sin{i}$ plane shows that runaway stars with low peculiar space velocities but high $v\\sin{i}$ remain on the Galactic disk, whereas those with high peculiar space velocities but low $v\\sin{i}$ pass through the disk, possibly reflecting two distinct origins.",

By exploring the simplest cosmological model in the bulk, that of an empty and flat space with a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$, we find that its holographic dual makes sense as a theory of fundamental quantum degrees of freedom at the boundary. Moreover, we find that an observer in the bulk, making long-range (electromagnetic and gravitational) observations, cannot distinguish the acceleration induced by the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ from that induced by the thermodynamic properties of the boundary, the de Sitter horizon. By including matter in the bulk we extend this holographic principle to GREA, where the quantum d.o.f. associated with the evolving boundary of the causal horizon induces an entropic acceleration that varies in time. Future observations will determine whether our causal horizon is responsible for the present acceleration and whether our universe will end in de Sitter or Minkowski.",

Through general-relativistic calculations of uniformly rotating sequences, we analyze their mass--radius relations, moments of inertia, quadrupole moments, surface redshifts, Keplerian frequencies, and energy components. A central result of this work is the full decomposition of the stellar energy budget in rotating strange stars, separating gravitational, internal, rotational, and binding energy contributions. Rotation amplifies the intrinsic EOS differences: the MIT model supports more massive ($M_{\\max} \\gtrsim 3.3\\,M_\\odot$) compact stars with larger moments of inertia and greater resistance to deformation, while the DDQM model produces larger radii, less massive stars limited by mass-shedding at lower frequencies. Combined measurements of mass, radius, and frequency can thus break the EOS degeneracy; massive, rapidly rotating pulsars favors MIT-like EOS, whereas larger radii in canonical stars point to a DDQM-like model. These rotational observables, soon to be tightly constrained by NICER and next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, offer a means to test the existence and composition of self-bound quark matter in compact stars.",

        "abstract": "We argue that the benchmark freeze in dark matter (DM) scenario for direct detection experiments, in which a DM candidate interacts with the Standard Model (SM) through an ultralight dark photon, becomes sensitive to the visible sector reheating temperature if it is sufficiently high. At such temperatures, the irreducible ultraviolet (UV) freeze in production of DM through graviton exchange becomes important and must be combined with the infrared (IR) freeze in yield mediated by the dark photon. As long as gravitationally produced DM does not equilibrate through annihilation into dark photons and the subsequent formation of a dark thermal bath, it retains information about the reheating phase. Including this gravitational contribution relaxes the required DM and SM portal coupling and allows smaller values than those that would match the observed relic abundance through IR freeze in alone. Since current direct detection experiments have excluded the benchmark freeze in model over a wide range of DM masses, they are now effectively probing high reheating temperatures and the gravitational freeze in of DM.",

From the inferred redshift of the absorption line, the compactness of the neutron star can be derived. Using a photoionization absorption model, we measure a gravitational redshift of about 1.72, which corresponds to a compactness R/M of 4.46 \\pm 0.13 km per solar mass, or 3.02 \\pm 0.09 in dimensionless units.

        "abstract": "Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are the dominant Ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray sources in the LHAASO catalog suggesting that they are the dominant leptonic PeVatrons in our Galaxy. Despite this, still very little is known about their UHE gamma-ray emission, their number in the Galaxy, or their contribution to the gamma-ray emission of our Galaxy. In this work, we propose a self-consistent data-driven model of the UHE gamma-ray emission of PWNe based on the ATNF and LHAASO catalogs. More specifically, we build a model of the UHE gamma-ray emission of PWNe that preserves the statistical relationships in the ATNF catalog and reproduces the number of PWNe detected in the LHAASO catalog. To cope with the limited data available in the LHAASO catalog when performing fits on gamma-ray data, we introduce the concept of censored regression that allows to also use the information provided by unresolved sources. Using our model, we find that reproducing the number of PWNe detected by LHAASO requires either fractions of misaligned pulsars smaller ($\\lesssim60\\%$) than usually found in the literature, or that some of the associations of PWNe to ATNF pulsars made by LHAASO may not be true. In both cases, we find that in order to reach self-consistency between radio and gamma-ray data, it is necessary that the majority of the unidentified sources in the LHAASO catalog are PWNe associated to an unseen pulsar. Moreover, using our model we also find that the contribution of unresolved PWNe to the total (diffuse) gamma-ray background measured by LHAASO in the $1-1000\\,\\rm{TeV}$ range is always smaller than $\\lesssim10\\%$ ($\\lesssim30\\%$). We conclude that PWNe mostly contribute to the source component of the UHE gamma-ray sky, while having almost no imprint on its diffuse component.",

Non-annihilating (e.g., asymmetric) dark matter capturing in a neutron star could form a small black hole in its core, which could then rapidly evaporate away. If black holes form and evaporate within the cooling timescale of the neutron star, periodic episodes of black hole evaporation could impart a steady-state stellar luminosity, providing a source of heat additional to the kinetic energy of dark matter during capture. Consequently, we obtain sensitivities to dark matter-nucleon cross sections that are stronger than that from dark kinetic heating by a factor of a few for > $10^4$ GeV (> $10^{10}$ GeV) mass of spin-0 (spin-1/2) dark matter.",

        "abstract": "Intermittent jet activity of AGNs is a common phenomenon, whereas significant jet reorientation during episodic jet activity in relatively young radio galaxies are rarely reported. The quasar 0954+556 at redshift of 0.903 is an intriguing source exhibiting an unusual radio jet structure with significantly different jet directions at kpc and pc scales. At kpc scales, images from the VLA exhibit a bright core, a linear jet extending 24 kpc to the northwest, and a discrete jet component 16 kpc to the northeast. At pc scales, images from the VLBA show a two-component structure with a projected separation of 360 pc in the north-south direction. The peculiar structure of 0954+556 might result from jet reorientation. Here, our aim was to investigate the possible mechanism via multiscale and multifrequency deep radio images. We performed VLA and VLBA observations of 0954+556. Together with some existing data in the NRAO data archive, we made multiple VLA images at 1.4-22 GHz and VLBA images at 1.7-43 GHz for various image analyses of the jet structure. We identified the location of the radio core at pc scales, detected the faint counter-jets at both pc and kpc scales for the first time, and revealed a diffuse emission region connecting pc and kpc scale forward jets. Our spectral index distribution and spectral aging analysis indicate that 0954+556 might undergo at least two episodes of jet activity during the current AGN phase. Moreover, pc scale polarization maps display a well-resolved spine-sheath polarization structure. It seems that the jet direction of 0954+556 changed significantly during intermittent jet activity. This may explain the different jet orientations and spectral ages observed from kpc to pc scales. The research provides a strong case that AGN jet direction might change rapidly on timescales of one million years.",

Physics lecturing can be more effective when digital twins are used to accompany theory classes. Research in physics has greatly benefited from the advent of modern, high-level programming languages, which facilitate the implementation of user-friendly code. Here, we report our own Python-based software, the gr-orbit-toolkit, to simulate orbits in classical and general relativistic scenarios. First, we present the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for classical and relativistic orbital accelerations. For the latter, we follow a post-Newtonian approach. Second, we describe our algorithm, which numerically integrates these ODEs to simulate the orbits of small-sized objects orbiting around massive bodies by using Euler and Runge-Kutta methods. Then, we study a set of sample two-body models with either the Sun or a black hole in the center. Our simulations confirm that the orbital motions predicted by classical and relativistic ODEs drastically differ for bodies near the Schwarzschild radius of the central massive body. Classical mechanics explains the orbital motion of objects far away from a central massive body, but general relativity is required to study objects moving at close proximity to a massive body, where the gravitational field is strong. Our study on objects with different eccentricities confirms that our code captures relativistic orbital precession. Our convergence analysis shows the toolkit is numerically robust. Our gr-orbit-toolkit aims at facilitating teaching and research in general relativity, so a comprehensive user and developer guide is provided in the public code repository.",

Over a 15-minute period, we identify complex, superimposed spectro-temporal structures, including: (1) broadband, second-long modulation lanes with downward frequency drifts, (2) narrowband ($\\approx$ 50 MHz), short-duration S-burst envelopes with upward drifts, and (3) even narrower ($\\approx$ 10 MHz), millisecond-scale S-burst striae within these envelopes. Using the discrete Fourier transform and auto-correlation function, we identify two dominant periodic emission patterns, corresponding to the periodicities of the S-bursts ($\\approx0.1$ s) and the striae ($\\approx0.01$ s). The complex superposition of diverse time-frequency structures poses a challenge to interpreting all the emission variability as intrinsic to the source. We propose that the modulation lanes could be a propagation effect as the radio waves traverse an inhomogeneous, regularly structured plasma region in the AD Leo's magnetosphere. By modelling a plasma screen with sinusoidal phase variation in one dimension, we show that we could qualitatively reconstruct the observed modulation lanes. The origin of the finest structures, the striae, remains unclear. Our work highlights that propagation effects in the stellar magnetosphere can potentially probe kilometre-scale structures in the emission regions and provide novel constraints on density inhomogeneities caused by magnetohydrodynamic waves that are difficult to access by other means.",

        "abstract": "Binaries that host a carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WC) star and an OB-type companion can be copious dust producers. Yet the properties of dust, particularly the grain size distribution, in these systems remain uncertain. We present Band 6 observations of WR 112 by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope (ALMA), which are the first millimeter observations of a WC binary system capable of resolving its dust emission. By combining ALMA observations with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images, we were able to analyze the spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) of WR 112. We found that the SEDs are consistent with emissions from hydrogen-poor amorphous carbon grains. Notably, our results also suggest that the majority of grains in the system have radii below one micrometer, and the extended dust structures are dominated by nanometer-sized grains. Among four parameterizations of the grain radius distribution that we tested, a bimodal distribution, with abundant nanometer-sized grains and a secondary population of 0.1-micron grains, best reproduces the observed SED. This bimodal distribution helps to reconcile the previously conflicting grain size estimates reported for WR 112 and for other WC systems. We hypothesize that dust destruction mechanisms such as radiative torque disruption and radiative-driven sublimation are responsible for driving the system to the bimodal grain size distribution.",

The beam combination will be achieved by a four-telescope integrated optics beam combiner (IOBC) that fulfills specific requirements. Our goal was to manufacture the mid-infrared IOBC for NOTT based on the double-Bracewell architecture and run a detailed laboratory characterization in the L' band. We focus on the achievable raw and self-calibrated nulling ratios. We use a double Michelson interferometer to produce four broadband coherent beams simulating the four telescopes of the VLTI and perform broadband nulling at room temperature. We analyze the modal, chromatic, and polarization behavior of the IOBC, and measure its total throughput. We were able to manufacture a single-mode four-telescope double-Bracewell IOBC in GLS mid-infrared transparent glass using Ultrafast Laser Inscription. We show that the directional couplers forming the four-telescope IOBC (4T-nuller) have an achromatic splitting ratio across the band 3.65-3.85 um with a 40/60 and 50/50 splitting for the side couplers and the central coupler, respectively. We report a total throughput of 37%, including the Fresnel losses that will be mitigated with anti-reflection coatings, and quantify differential birefringence. Operating at room temperature, with 200 nm bandwidth centered at 3.8 um and without polarization control, we measure an average raw null of 8.13+/-0.03x10-3 and a self-calibrated null of 1.14+/-0.01x10-3. Finally, we show that a theta^6 broad null can be experimentally reproduced in these conditions. This is, to our knowledge, the first measurement of a broadband L' deep null obtained with a four-telescope integrated optics beam combiner. The next step foresees testing the 4T-nuller in cryogenic conditions.",

        "abstract": "Measuring cometary nuclei is notoriously difficult because they are usually unresolved and embedded within bright comae, which hampers direct size measurements even with space telescopes. We present a practical, instrumental method that, stabilises the inner core through bicubic resampling, performs forward point-spread function PSF+convolution, and separates the unresolved nucleus from the inner-coma profile via an explicit Dirac Delta function added to a Rho^-1 surface brightness law. The method yields the nucleus flux by fitting an azimuthal averaged profile with two amplitudes only PSF core and convolved coma, with transparent residual diagnostics. As a case study, we apply the workflow to the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS alias C/2025 N1, incorporating Hubble Space Telescope constraints on the nucleus size. We find that radius solutions consistent with 0.16 <= Rn <= 2.8 km for Pv = 0.04 are naturally recovered, in line with the most recent HST upper limits. The approach is well-suited for survey pipelines Rubin LSST and targeted follow up.",

        "abstract": "Direct astrometric detection of exomoons remains unexplored. This study presents the first application of high-precision astrometry to search for exomoons around substellar companions. We investigate whether the orbital motion of the companion HD 206893 B exhibits astrometric residuals consistent with the gravitational influence of an exomoon or binary planet. Using the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument, we monitored the astrometric positions of HD 206893 B and c across both short (days to months) and long (yearly) timescales. This enabled us to isolate potential residual wobbles in the motion of component B attributable to an orbiting moon. Our analysis reveals tentative astrometric residuals in the HD 206893 B orbit. If interpreted as an exomoon signature, these residuals correspond to a candidate (HD 206893 B I) with an orbital period of approximately 0.76 years and a mass of $\\sim$0.4 Jupiter masses. However, the origin of these residuals remains ambiguous and could be due to systematics. Complementing the astrometry, our analysis of GRAVITY $R=4000$ spectroscopy for HD 206893 B confirms a clear detection of water, but no CO is found using cross-correlation. We also find that AF Lep b, and $\\beta$ Pic b are the best short-term candidates to look for moons with GRAVITY+. Our observations demonstrate the transformative potential of high-precision astrometry in the search for exomoons, and proves the feasibility of the technique to detect moons with masses lower than Jupiter and potentially down to less than Neptune in optimistic cases. Crucially, further high-precision astrometric observations with VLTI/GRAVITY are essential to verify the reality and nature of this signal and attempt this technique on a variety of planetary systems.",

We focus on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as possible candidate materials for single chiral phonon detection due to their noncentrosymmetric structure, tunability, and the ability to host these excitations in stable acoustic bands. We identify several promising candidates and compare their projected dark matter detection sensitivity for all possible interactions identified within effective field theory. We establish that the expected sensitivity does not depend heavily on the specific choice of the MOF, enabling us to tailor the final material composition to facilitate the magnetic readout. We then propose a prototype setup able to test the direct readout of a chiral phonon sensor with a surface-integrated magnetometer.",

        "abstract": "Efforts to understand the equation of state (EOS) of dense nuclear matter at supra-saturation densities have grown more sophisticated over the past decade, driven by a surge in high-precision data from both terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations. While for the former, heavy-ion collisions (HIC) represent a unique opportunity to constraint the EOS in a controlled laboratory setting, the latter can be precisely probed thanks to the advent of multi-messenger astronomy (MMA). However, as we move away from our understanding drawn from individual sources and limited statistics to the era of precision physics with improved datasets, the need for a systematic way to combine them becomes clear. In this article, we trace the individual methods for extracting the EOS both for HIC and MMA. We then review the current state-of-the-art efforts to combine these individual information sources from Bayesian multi-source analysis, e.g., the Nuclear Physics and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (NMMA) and Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics (BAND) frameworks, and fully integrated EOS frameworks, i.e., the Modular Unified Solver for the Equation of State (MUSES) calculation engine. We highlight the scientific advances made possible by each step and outline the remaining challenges that must be addressed to build a coherent, predictive picture of dense nuclear matter across all relevant regimes.",

In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data \\cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim} and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\\lesssim r\\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $\\alpha^{\\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.",

In this work, we present targeted radio observations of 31 such candidates using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, and the Shanghai TianMa Radio Telescope. Over a total of 46.65 hours of observing time, we detected neither periodic nor single-pulse radio emissions. These nondetections place stringent upper limits on the flux densities of any potential radio signals, reaching ~4 $\\mu$Jy for periodic emission and ~10 mJy for single pulses with FAST. Since our observations are highly sensitive and the flux density upper limits are well below the median fluxes of known Galactic pulsars, this suggests that geometric beaming is the most likely explanation for the non-detections if these objects are indeed pulsars. Alternatively, the NSs may be sufficiently old ($\\gtrsim$ 10 Gyr) and have become intrinsically radio-quiet. In this case, our findings highlight the inherent difficulty of confirming NSs in such old detached binary systems through radio pulsation searches.",

We show that simply using the Bianchi-I type metric does not resolve a striking characteristic of the field equations in $\\mathrm{NUG}$: their underdetermination. This fact led us to implement extra conditions on the combination $\\left(\\rho+p\\right)$ and, consequently, obtain a consistent background cosmological analysis. In the vacuum case, we obtain an analogy between the Kasner solutions and the equations in $\\mathrm{NUG}$. We also propose a new analysis of a non-homogeneous equation of state, the combination $\\left(\\rho+p\\right)=l$. We identify that the cosmological dynamics are strictly dependent on the value of the constant $l$. The physically interesting case is at the value $l<0$, which seems to indicate a super-accelerated, ghost-like universe. This case still requires a more detailed analysis, for example, from a thermodynamic point of view, keeping in mind that $\\left(\\rho+p\\right)$ may be interpreted as enthalpy of the system. For the cases $\\left(\\rho+p\\right)\\propto a^{-3}$ and $\\left(\\rho+p\\right) \\propto a^{-4}$, we obtain a description consistent with the anisotropic cosmological model described by $\\mathrm{GR}$. In all cases analyzed, a small value for the anisotropic parameter $\\Omega_{A}$ (on the order of $10^{-2}$) is required in order to have agreement, for example, with the age of the universe to be approximately $12-14\\, \\mathrm{Gyr}$, agreeing with the age of globular clusters. As the universe expands an isotropization is verified, with the anistropies going to zero asymptotically, similarly with what happens in an anistropic cosmological model based on $\\mathrm{GR}$.",

        "abstract": "Searches for radio technosignatures place constraints on the prevalence of extraterrestrial transmitters in our Galaxy and beyond. It is important to account for the complete stellar population captured within a radio telescope's field of view, or stellar 'bycatch'. In recent years, catalogues from ESA's Gaia mission have enabled SETI surveys to place tighter limits on extraterrestrial transmitter statistics. However, Gaia remains restricted by magnitude limits, astrometric uncertainty at large distances, and confusion in crowded regions. To address these limitations, we investigate the use of the Besan\\c{c}on Galactic Model to simulate the statistical underlying stellar population to derive more realistic constraints on the occurrence of extraterrestrial transmitters. We apply this method to Breakthrough Listen's Enriquez/Price survey, modelling 6,182,364 stellar objects within 1229 individual pointings and extending the search out to distances $\\leq 25$kpc. We place limits on the prevalence of high duty cycle transmitters within 2.5kpc, suggesting $\\leq (0.000995 \\pm 0.000002)\\%$ of stellar systems contain such a transmitter (for near-zero drift rates and EIRP$_{\\mathrm{min}} \\gtrsim 5 \\times 10^{16}$W). In support of broader adoption, we provide a simple calculator tool that enables other researchers to incorporate this approach into their own SETI analyses. Our results enable a more complete statistical estimation of the number and stellar type of systems probed, thereby strengthening constraints on technosignature prevalence and guiding the analysis of future SETI efforts. We also conclude that SETI surveys are, in fact, much less biased by anthropocentric assumptions than is often suggested.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the impact of spectral coverage on parameter recovery is critical for accurate interpretation of blazar spectra. In this study, we examine how the data coverage influences the reliability of parameter estimation within the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) framework. Using OJ 287, TXS 0506+056, and Mrk 421 as representative of the low-, intermediate- and high synchrotron peak classes (LSP, ISP and HSP), respectively, we generate synthetic SEDs based on their best-fit models and perform 1,000 fits for each of the 21 observational configurations per source type. Our analysis quantifies the coverage probability for all model parameters, such has the magnetic field strength and the electron luminosity, and reveals that different blazar subclasses exhibit distinct sensitivities to spectral gaps. For LSPs, a minimal dataset comprising optical/UV, X-ray, and GeV $\\gamma$-ray bands is sufficient for robust parameter inference. In contrast, ISPs and HSPs require broader spectral coverage to constrain the physical parameters. For ISP, we find that reliable parameter recovery can be achieved with two different minimal band combinations: \\textit{(i)} X-ray, high energy $\\gamma$-ray, and very high energy $\\gamma$-ray data, or \\textit{(ii)} optical/UV, X-ray, and high energy $\\gamma$-ray data. For HSPs, the minimal configuration enabling reliable parameter recovery includes the optical/UV, X-ray, and very high energy $\\gamma$-ray bands. We discuss the role of very high energy $\\gamma$-ray observations, showing that they significantly enhance parameter recovery for HSPs. Our results provide practical guidelines for designing optimized multi-wavelength observation campaigns and for assessing the robustness of SSC model inferences under incomplete spectral coverage.",

        "abstract": "Galaxy disks in rotation are sometimes the site of radial flows, especially in their gas component. It is important to estimate the outflows, due to AGN or supernovae feedback, or inflows due to bar gravity torques. However, these radial flows may be confused with non-circular motions, which are quite frequent in the center of galaxy disks. We use a simulated giant, barred spiral galaxy from the GalMer database to study the non-circular motions induced by the bar. Our goal is to identify the spurious radial flows that kinematics modeling algorithms can detect, assuming circular orbits for the gas. Using mock data of a strongly barred galaxy, we quantify the radial velocities computed by the 3D-Barolo algorithm for different disk inclinations and several bar orientations in the plane of the sky: along the major and minor kinematic axes and at 45{\\deg} from them. Our results show that projection effects cause kinematics modeling algorithms to confuse the radial component of velocity due to elliptical orbits with significant radial flows with mean values up to 84 km.s$^{-1}$, within the bar region. The computed rotation curve is also wrongly estimated inside the bar region, by as much as 150 km.s$^{-1}$ for the highest inclination.",

Facilities like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will significantly advance the feasibility of characterizing the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, while other future mission concepts could extend this search to mid-infrared wavelengths. We draw upon a recently developed set of ten self-consistent scenarios for future Earth technospheres as analogs for extraterrestrial technospheres, which we use to outline a stepwise technosignature search strategy beginning with HWO and followed by other missions. We find that HWO could reveal elevated abundances of a CO$_2$ + NO$_2$ pair on planets with combustion and other large-scale industry, which could be observable in up to in eight of the ten scenarios. Follow-up radio observations could reveal narrow-band directed transmissions, which occurs in two of the scenarios. Further study by direct detection at mid-infrared wavelengths with the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) could reveal spectral features from industry, such as the combination of CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 in four scenarios and CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 + CF$_4$ in one scenario; two of these also include the N$_2$O + CH$_4$ + NH$_3$ triple from large-scale agriculture.

        "abstract": "The unprecedented sensitivity of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, which enables the detection of distant astrophysical sources, also renders the detectors highly susceptible to low-frequency ground motion. Persistent microseisms in the 0.1-0.3 Hz band couple into the instruments, degrade lock stability, and contribute substantially to detector downtime during observing runs. The multi-stage seismic isolation system has achieved remarkable success in mitigating such disturbances through active feedback control, yet residual platform motion remains a key factor limiting low-frequency sensitivity and duty cycle. Further reduction of this residual motion is therefore critical for improving the long-term stability and overall astrophysical reach of the observatories.   In this work, we develop a data-driven approach that uses machine learning to model and suppress residual seismic motion within the isolation system. Ground and platform sensor data from the detectors are used to train a neural network that predicts platform motion driven by microseismic activity. When incorporated into the control scheme, the network's predictions yield up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in residual motion compared to conventional linear filtering methods, revealing that nonlinear couplings play a significant role in limiting current isolation performance. These results demonstrate that machine-learning-based control can provide a powerful new pathway for enhancing active seismic isolation, improving lock robustness, and extending the low-frequency observational capabilities of gravitational-wave detectors.",

The solar wind plays an important role in forming the large-scale coronal structure and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are used to reproduce it for further studying coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We conduct a data-constrained MHD simulation of the global solar corona including solar wind effects of the 2024 April 8 TSE with observed magnetograms using the Message Passing Interface Adaptive Mesh Refinement Versatile Advection Code (MPI-AMRVAC) within 2.5 $R_\\odot$. This TSE happened within the solar maximum, hence the global corona was highly structured. Our MHD simulation includes the energy equation with a reduced polytropic index $\\gamma=1.05$. We compare the global magnetic field for multiple magnetograms and use synchronic frames from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager to initialize the magnetic field configuration from a magneto-frictionally equilibrium solution, called the Outflow field. We detail the initial and boundary conditions employed to time-advance the full set of ideal MHD equations such that the global corona is relaxed to a steady state. The magnetic field, the velocity field, and distributions of the density and thermal pressure are successfully reproduced. We demonstrate direct comparisons with TSE images in white-light and Fe XIV emission augmented with quasi-separatrix layers, the integrated current density, and the synthetic white-light radiation, and find a good agreement between simulations and observations. This provides a fundamental background for future simulations to study the triggering and acceleration mechanisms of CMEs under solar wind effects.",

One of its intriguing features is the presence of relativistic radio jets almost perpendicular to the observed extended gamma-ray emission, implying significant propagation effects or interactions with the Galactic magnetic field. Here we report observational evidence that the radio jet and the very high-energy (VHE) and ultra high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray emission could be aligned along a common axis, indicating a co-spatial or co-directional origin. This alignment supports a model where synchrotron radio emission, VHE and UHE gamma rays are produced within a single, highly collimated relativistic outflow. Our findings favor scenarios of in-situ particle acceleration up to hundreds of TeV, challenge previous interpretations involving large-scale particle diffusion, and simplify the geometric modeling of the source. This case highlights the potential of V4641 Sgr as a PeVatron candidate within our Galaxy and provides a benchmark for understanding jet composition and magnetic structure in microquasars.",

The photonic lantern (PL) can be used to sense aberrations at the final science imaging plane.

We demonstrate closed-loop control of residual wavefront errors using a non-dispersed PL after first-stage AO correction on the Shane 3m telescope at Lick Observatory.

Among these, optically thin inverse-Compton (IC) scattering remains an important yet under-tested mechanism. From an initial set of 41 bursts selected using empirical Band-function criteria that highlight quasi-thermal low-energy slopes ($\\alpha > -0.5$) and constrained high-energy indices ($-1.7 > \\beta > -3.3$), only four events satisfy these conditions consistently in both time-integrated and time-resolved spectra. The IC fits yield self-consistent constraints on the seed-photon field and the electron population at the dissipation site. For bulk Lorentz factors $\\Gamma \\sim 170$-$550$, we infer seed thermal peaks of $\\sim 0.05$-$0.2$ keV and electron thermal energies of $\\sim 20$-$300$ keV in the co-moving frame. A fraction of only $0.1\\%$-$20\\%$ of electrons are accelerated into a non-thermal tail with an average index value of $\\delta \\sim 1.8$.

Furthermore, the framework allows us to constrain even sub-dominant thermal components that lie below the detector's low-energy threshold.

In particular, we investigate the impacts of the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials, the stiffness of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) EOS, the high-density behaviors of the symmetry energy and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections on proton $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, and $v_{4}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}} = 2.4\\,\\text{GeV}$. Our results show that the proton anisotropic flows are strongly sensitive to the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potential as well as the incompressibility coefficient $K_0$ of SNM. In addition, the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_2$ exhibits a modest sensitivity to the higher-order skewness coefficient $J_0$ and kurtosis coefficient $I_0$ of SNM as well as the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential, while the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_1$ is shown to modestly depend on the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections. Moreover, the high-density symmetry energy seems to have limited effects on the proton anisotropic flows. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials including the symmetry potential, the higher-order characteristic parameters of SNM EOS beyond $K_0$, and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections, in future Bayesian transport model analyses on proton anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at HADES energies, thereby to extract information on nuclear matter EOS as well as the associated underlying nuclear effective interactions.",

        "abstract": "From al-Sufi's tenth-century observation of the Andromeda Galaxy as a \"little cloud\" to contemporary space missions, Islamic astronomy represents a millennium-spanning tradition of innovation and knowledge. This study traces its trajectory through three phases: the Golden Age (8th to 15th centuries), when scholars such as al-Biruni, al-Battani, and Ibn Sina developed instruments, cataloged the heavens, and refined theories that later influenced Copernicus; a period of decline (late 15th to 17th centuries), shaped by political fragmentation, economic shifts, and the delayed adoption of technologies such as printing and the telescope; and today's revival, marked by observatory collaborations, Olympiad successes, and emerging space programs in Morocco, Iran, Turkey, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. This comparative analysis with Chinese and European scientific traditions shows how Islamic astronomy provided a vital link in the global history of science, transmitting mathematical rigor, observational methods, and Arabic star names that are still used today. The contemporary resurgence signals the potential for renewed contributions to astrophysics, provided that it is supported by regional observatory networks, space-based research initiatives, and educational frameworks that integrate historical heritage with modern computational science.",

        "abstract": "Spacecraft equipped with multiple propulsion modes or systems can offer enhanced performance and mission flexibility compared with traditional configurations. Despite these benefits, the trajectory optimization of spacecraft utilizing such configurations remains a complex challenge. This paper presents a sequential convex programming (SCP) approach for the optimal design of multi-mode and multi-propulsion spacecraft trajectories. The method extends the dynamical linearization within SCP using sparse automatic differentiation, enabling efficient inclusion of multiple propulsion modes or systems without complex manual reformulation while maintaining comparable computational efficiency. New constraint formulations are introduced to ensure selection of a single propulsion mode at each time step and limit the total number of modes used. The approach is demonstrated for (i) a low-thrust Earth-67P rendezvous using the SPT-140 thruster with 20 discrete modes, and (ii) an Earth-Mars transfer employing both a low-thrust engine and a solar sail. Results confirm that the proposed method can efficiently compute optimal trajectories for these scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Planetary atmospheric energy budgets primarily depend on stellar incident flux. However, stellar variability can have major consequences for the evolution of planetary climates. In this work, we evaluate how stellar variability influences the equilibrium temperature and water retention of planets within the Habitable Zone (HZ). We present a sample of 9 stars that are known to host at least one planet within the HZ and that were identified to have a variability amplitude exceeding 100 ppm based on photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We investigate the effect that the variability of these stars have on the insolation flux of their HZ planets and the resulting changes in the induced planetary equilibrium temperature. Our results show that for the stars in our sample, the stellar variability has an insignificant effect on the equilibrium temperature of HZ planets. However, we also emphasize that these stars are not representative of more extreme variable stars, since exoplanets are more difficult to detect and characterize in the presence of extreme variability. We also investigate the equilibrium temperature and long-term evolution of a hypothetical Earth-like planet placed at the inner edge of the HZ around a highly variable star. We found that the water loss rates are comparable between both variable and quiet host stars for Earth-like planets in the inner HZ. Overall, these results broaden our knowledge on the impact of stellar variability on planetary habitability.",

        "abstract": "We report on follow-up observations with XMM-Newton, the FORS2 instrument at the ESO-VLT, and FAST, aiming to characterise the nature of five thermally emitting isolated neutron star (INS) candidates recently discovered from searches in the footprint of the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG)/eROSITA All-sky Survey. We find that the X-ray spectra are predominantly thermal and can be described by low-absorbed blackbody models with effective temperatures ranging from 50 to 210 eV. In two sources, the spectra also show narrow absorption features at $300 - 400$ eV. Additional non-thermal emission components are not detected in any of the five candidates. The soft X-ray emission, the absence of optical counterparts in four sources, and the consequent large X-ray-to-optical flux ratios $>3000 - 5400$ confirm their INS nature. For the remaining source, eRASSU J144516.0-374428, the available data do not allow a confident exclusion of an active galactic nucleus nature. However, if the source is Galactic, the small inferred X-ray emitting region is reminiscent of a heated pulsar polar cap, possibly pointing to a binary pulsar nature. X-ray timing searches do not detect significant modulations in all candidates, implying pulsed fraction upper limits of 13 - 19% ($0.001-13.5$ Hz). The absence of pulsations in the FAST observations targeting eRASSU J081952.1-131930 and eRASSU J084046.2-115222 excludes periodic magnetospheric emission at 1 - 1.5 GHz with an $8\\sigma$ significance down to 4.08 $\\mu$Jy and 2.72 $\\mu$Jy, respectively. The long-term X-ray emission of all sources does not imply significant variability. Additional observations are warranted to establish exact neutron star types. At the same time, the confirmation of the predominantly thermal neutron star nature in four additional sources highlights the power of SRG/eROSITA to complement the Galactic INS population.",

Solar filaments often exhibit rotation and deflection during eruptions, which would significantly affect the geoeffectiveness of the coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that lead to such lateral displacement of filaments is a great concern to space weather forecasting. Two case studies are discussed. Firstly, the events of September 8 and September 10 2014, were analyzed from the Sun to the Earth. The numerical heliospheric simulation EUHFORIA shows that the handedness of the EUV sigmoid deduced from coronagraph observations was different from the tilt of the ICME at 1~au, suggesting a rotation of the CME in the low corona. A potential undetected low coronal rotation led to erroneous space weather prediction. The second event concerns a filament observed on August 20 2021, which underwent a rotation of 73 degrees during its eruption, implying a significant lateral drifting of the filament material. A data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation confirms such a rotation. These two studies reinforce the idea that CMEs are subjected to more significant rotation and deflection in the low corona than during their journey in the heliosphere.",

In this study, we comparatively examine the seasonal behaviour of vertical distribution of meteor occurrence height and decay time height at two identical radars of conjugate polar latitudes, Esrange (68$^\\circ$N) and Rothera (68$^\\circ$S). In order to understand the nature of meteor trail variations, the received signal power is categorised into two groups as weak and strong echoes, and their seasonal mean vertical profiles are constructed. It has been noticed that the meteor occurrence height shown a seasonal symmetry, however, decay time vertical profiles shows an asymmetric pattern at conjugate polar latitudes, particularly for strong echoes. Seasonally, there is about 1 km difference in occurrence height and decay time height of weak and strong echoes. From the decay time vertical profiles, it has been noticed that the decay time turning altitude (i.e., inflection point) varies seasonally in the altitudes range of 80-86 km for weak and strong echoes. The maximum turning altitude of about 85 km is observed in Northern winter at Esrange (68$^\\circ$N) and in Southern summer at Rothera (68$^\\circ$S), similarly minimum turning altitude of about 80 km is observed in Northern winter at Esrange (68$^\\circ$N) and in Southern summer at Rothera (68$^\\circ$S).

        "abstract": "In X-ray astronomy, most observatories utilize multi-pixel photon-counting devices. When a photon counting device observes a bright source, we face an unavoidable problem called pile-up. Pile-up leads to mistakes in the observational properties of the source, mainly an apparent decrease in the X-ray flux. X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) has two X-ray telescopes, one of which is Xtend, a CCD camera with a wide field-of-view (FOV) of 38 arcmin square. Xtend has three operating modes: full window mode with a frame exposure of ~4 s, 1/8 window mode with ~0.5s and reduced FOV, and 1/8 window mode with burst option, whose frame exposure is reduced to ~0.06 s. Observers need to select the operating mode according to their target fluxes. We develop the pile-up simulator for Xtend to provide a quantitative assessment of pile-up according to the fluxes, spectra, and shapes of X-ray sources. We derived the 10% pile-up limits for a point source of 7.8, 66.2, and 447.9 counts/s for full window, 1/8 window, and 1/8 window mode with burst option, respectively, by assuming the Crab spectrum.

This frequency range was selected because VLF radio waves are efficiently reflected by the lower ionospheric layers, and any changes in these layers lead to corresponding variations in the received signal. We have used a magnetic loop antenna for signal reception along with a low noise amplifier, analog-to-digital converter, and spectrum analyzer. Data was collected over the course of a few days, from a remote location with minimal electromagnetic interference. From the viewpoint of cost, simplicity and accessibility, this method far surpasses traditional methods of detecting solar flares, using satellites, telescopes, etc.",

This study comprehensively characterizes key performance parameters of the detector to ensure its suitability for astronomical observations. Through a multi-stage screening protocol, we identified an EMCCD chip exhibiting high resolution and low noise. The electron-multiplying gain (EM Gain) of the EMCCD was analyzed to determine its impact on signal amplification and noise characteristics, identifying the optimal operational range. Additionally, noise properties such as readout noise were investigated. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized detector meets CPI-C's initial application requirements, achieving high resolution and low noise. This study provides theoretical and experimental foundations for the use of EMCCD-based WFS in adaptive optics and astronomical observations, ensuring their reliability for advanced space-based imaging applications",

        "abstract": "Comet Interceptor is an ESA science mission with payload contributions from ESA Member States and with an international participation by JAXA. It is the first mission that is being designed, built, and potentially launched before its target is known. This approach will enable the spacecraft to perform the first mission to a Long Period Comet from the Oort Cloud, as these comets have fleeting visits to the inner Solar System lasting only months to years from first discovery, too short for the usual process of mission development to be followed. In this paper we describe a number of factors that need to be considered in selecting a target for the mission, including scientific, orbital, spacecraft and instrument constraints, and discussion of different prioritisation strategies. We find that, in the case where we have a choice of targets, our decisions will mostly be driven by orbital information, which we will have relatively early on, with information on the activity level of the comet an important but secondary consideration. As cometary activity levels are notoriously hard to predict based on early observations alone, this prioritisation / decision approach based more on orbits gives us confidence that a good comet that is compatible with the spacecraft constraints will be selectable with sufficient warning time to allow the mission to intercept it.",

        "title": "Advances and Challenges in Solar Flare Prediction: A Review",
        "abstract": "Solar flares, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, have a profound impact on both the Earth's space environment and human activities. As a result, accurate solar flare prediction has emerged as a central topic in space weather research. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in the field of solar flare forecasting, driven by the rapid advancements in space observation technology and the continuous improvement of data processing capabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state of research in this area, with a particular focus on tracing the evolution of data-driven approaches -- which have progressed from early statistical learning techniques to more sophisticated machine learning and deep learning paradigms, and most recently, to the emergence of Multimodal Large Models (MLMs). Furthermore, this study examines the realistic performance of existing flare forecasting platforms, elucidating their limitations in operational space weather applications and thereby offering a practical reference for future advancements in technological optimization and system design.",

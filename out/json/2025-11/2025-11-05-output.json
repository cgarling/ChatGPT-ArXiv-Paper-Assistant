We estimate these by sampling satellite orbits from cosmological N-body simulations matched on mass, distance and velocity along the line of sight, in addition to properties of the host system. Our predictions are probabilistic based on repeated sampling from the uncertainty distributions of all quantities involved. We use these constraints on the satellites' orbital histories in conjunction with their published star formation histories to investigate the dominant environmental mechanisms for quenching satellites of M31-like hosts. Around half of the satellites appear to have quenched before their first pericentric passage around M31. Only the most massive satellites (with stellar masses > 10^8 M_sun) are able to maintain star formation for up to billions of years after infall. The majority of faint satellites, with stellar masses < 10^8 M_sun , were likely quenched before entering the M31 system. We compare our results for M31 against predictions for the Milky Way's satellites from the literature; M31's has a more active recent accretion history with more recently quenched satellites than the Milky Way.",

Among all the developments made thus far, Cesam2k20 now implements state-of-the-art models for the transport of chemical elements and angular momentum. It was recently made publicly available with an ecosystem of other codes interfaced with it: 1D and 2D oscillation codes ADIPLS and ACOR, optimisation program OSM, and Python utility package pycesam. This paper recalls the numerical peculiarities of Cesam2k20, namely, the use of a collocation method where the structure variables are decomposed as piecewise polynomials projected on a B-spline basis.

        "abstract": "The distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way (MW) is expected to exhibit a large-scale dynamical response to the recent infall of the LMC. This event produces a dynamical friction wake and shifts the MW's halo density center. The structure of this response encodes information about the LMC- MW mass ratio, the LMC's orbit, the MW halo's pre-infall structure and could provide constraints on dark matter physics. To extract this information, a method to separate these effects and recover the initial shape of the MW's halo is required. Here, we use basis function expansions to analyze the halo response in eighteen simulations of MW-LMC-like interactions from the MWest cosmological, dark-matter-only zoom-in simulations. The results show that mergers similar to the LMC consistently generate a significant dipole and a secondary quadrupole response in the halo. The dipole arises from the host density center displacement and halo distortions, and its amplitude scales as the square of the MW-LMC mass ratio, peaking 0.2-0.7 Gyr after the LMC's pericenter. The quadrupole's strength depends primarily on the original axis ratios of the host halo, though contributions from the dynamical friction wake cause it to peak less than 0.3 Gyr before pericenter. Future measurements of both the dipole and quadrupole imprints of the LMC's passage in the density of the MW's stellar halo should be able to disentangle these effects and provide insight into the initial structure of the MW's halo, the MW's response, and the mass of the LMC.",

        "abstract": "The LMC and SMC are interacting dwarf galaxies that offer a valuable testbed for studying the effects of galactic mergers. We investigate the chemodynamic history of the LMC in the context of its interaction with the SMC by inferring stellar birth radii, first validated on a hydrodynamical simulation tailored to reproduce their interaction history. Using inferred birth radii and stellar ages, we identify signatures of dynamical and chemical evolution across the LMC disk. We find that the LMC's metallicity gradient steepened around 5, 3, and 1 Gyr ago, coinciding with enhanced star formation (SF) episodes. These events exhibit distinct spatial patterns -- initially concentrated in the inner disk at 5 Gyr, expanding outward by 3 Gyr, and becoming widespread with renewed central activity at 1 Gyr -- likely reflecting changes in spin alignment between the interacting disks if the enhancements of SF tracks the pericenter passages of the SMC to the LMC. The inferred radial migration strength of the LMC shows notable enhancements at 0.5, 2, and 5 Gyr. The most $\\alpha$-enriched stars form 2-3 Gyr ago at birth radii of 2-4 kpc, the only epoch when star formation is broadly distributed across the disk. Finally, unlike the Milky Way, the LMC lacks a clear [$\\alpha$/M]-[Fe/H] bimodality. This is likely due to its more centrally concentrated star formation during these periods, compared to the MW's more extended outer-disk star formation enhancements. These findings place strong constraints on the LMC's assembly history and its interaction with the SMC.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the complicated processes that regulate star formation and cause a galaxy to become quiescent is key to our comprehension of galaxy evolution. We used nine well resolved star-forming z<1 galaxies from the UVCANDELS survey, where a total of 10 HST bands including UV follow up in UVIS/F275W allow us to reconstruct the star formation histories (SFHs) of regions across each galaxy. This approach provides a powerful tool to explore the spatio-temporal connection between star formation and galaxy evolution. The spatial and temporal profiles of stellar mass and star formation rate surface density were obtained from the SFHs of these regions. We measure scaling relations and projected radial profiles of regions within each galaxy at the time of observation and at 1 Gyr lookback time, noting possible trends in the evolution. By comparing the change in star formation over time we can infer the timing and location of star formation and see early signs of star formation shut off before quenching occurs. We compared the star formation rate density -- stellar mass density scaling relations for individual galaxies as they evolve from 1 Gyr lookback time. The correlation lines pivot around a log-stellar mass surface density of 7.25 [$M_\\odot$ $kpc^{-2}$] may be evidence of a self-regulating process on these scales. Radial profiles of galaxy Log sSFR show an overall decrease over 1 Gyr, but five galaxies show a greater change in Log sSFR at the outskirts than the center indicating a possible early onset of quenching in these galaxies.",

We theoretically model the destruction of GMCs by HII regions, which evaporate ionized gas and eject neutral gas during their expansion. HII regions follow one of three tracks, depending on the EUV luminosity, $S$, of the ionizing OB association: the expansion can stall inside the cloud; it can break out, forming a blister (champagne) flow; or, for $S>S_{\\rm com}$, it can result in the formation of a cometary cloud. We present results for the accumulated mass loss, $M_{\\rm loss}(t)$, and the final mass loss, $M_{{\\rm loss},f}$, by evaporation and ejection for a range of cloud masses ($10^4<10^{7}$ M$_\\odot$), cloud surface densities ($50<\\Sigma<1000$ M$_\\odot$ pc$^{-2}$), OB association luminosities ($10^{44}<10^{52}$ s$^{-1}$), and off-center position of the association.

Using the high-quality, homogeneous spectra of 336 hot subluminous star candidates from the Arizona-Montr\\'eal Spectroscopic Survey, we aim to improve our understanding of the atmospheric and stellar properties of hot subdwarf stars. We used large grids of model atmospheres to fit the observed spectra and derived their atmospheric parameters: effective temperature (Teff), surface gravity, and helium abundance. The model grids were further utilized to fit the spectral energy distribution of each star and the $Gaia$ parallax was used to compute the stellar parameters radius, luminosity, and mass. We detected helium stratification in six sdB stars with Teff around 30 kK, making them good candidates for also showing $^3$He enrichment in their atmospheres. The mass distributions of H-rich sdBs and sdOs are similar and centered around 0.47 $\\text{M}_\\odot$, consistent with the canonical formation scenario of helium ignition under degenerate conditions. Among the H-rich hot subdwarfs, we found no difference between the mass distributions of close binaries and apparently single stars. The He-sdOs have a significantly wider mass distribution than their H-rich counterparts, with an average mass of about 0.78 $\\text{M}_\\odot$. This strongly favors a merger origin for these He-rich objects. We identified a small number of candidate low-mass ($<$0.45$ \\text{M}_\\odot$) sdBs located below the EHB that might have originated from more massive progenitors. Finally, we identified more than 80 pulsating stars in our sample and found these to fall into well-defined $p$- and $g$-mode instability regions.",

        "abstract": "The pace at which galaxies grew into their current stellar masses and how this growth is regulated is still not fully understood, nor is the role that morphology plays in this process. We applied full spectral fitting techniques with pyPipe3D to the MaNGA sample to obtain its star formation and stellar mass histories and used these to investigate the mass assembly of galaxies by measuring how their specific star formation correlates to their stellar mass at different look-back times. We find that the correlation between these two parameters was shallower in the past. Galaxies used to have similar mass doubling times and the current negative correlation between the specific star formation and M* is primarily due to more massive galaxies 'dropping' off the main sequence earlier than less massive ones. Additionally, selecting the galaxies into bins based on their present-day morphology shows a segregation in specific star formation rate (sSFR) that is maintained even at high look-back times, showing that the factors that determine which morphology a galaxy ends up in are in place at very early times. Similarly, selecting them based on their current star formation status shows that, on average, currently retired galaxies used to have slightly a higher sSFR before the drop-off, whereas galaxies that have continued to form stars until today had a lower sSFR initially. We compare our results to a set of cosmic surveys, finding partial agreement in our results with several of them, though with significant offsets in redshift. Finally, we discuss how our results fit with certain theoretical models on galaxy evolution as well as cosmological simulations.",

We use data from the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey, which targets LAEs in three narrow redshift slices. We identify physically associated LAE multiples in the COSMOS field at $z = 2.4$, $z = 3.1$, and $z=4.5$, and use a mock catalog from the IllustrisTNG100 simulation to assess the completeness and contamination affecting the resulting sample of LAE multiples. We then study their statistical and radiative properties as a function of multiplicity, where we adopt the term multiplicity to refer to the number of physically associated LAEs. We find a strong correlation between LAE multiplicity and host halo mass in the mocks, with higher multiplicity systems preferentially occupying more massive halos. In both ODIN and the mock sample, we find indications that the mean Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity and UV magnitude of LAEs in multiples increase with multiplicity. The halo-wide LAE surface brightness densities in Ly$\\alpha$ and UV increase with multiplicity, reflecting more compact and actively star-forming environments. The close agreement between the model and ODIN observations supports the validity of the Ly$\\alpha$ emission model in capturing key physical processes in LAE environments. Finally, a subhalo-based perturbation induced star formation model reproduces the minimum subhalo mass distribution in simulations at $z=2.4$, suggesting that local perturbations, rather than the presence of LAE companions, drive star formation in these systems. For the higher redshifts, neighbor perturbations do not seem to be the main driver that triggers star formation.",

All three host rich molecular gas reservoirs and show prominent Balmer absorption from $30-100$ Myr-old stars consistent with long lasting star formation. Two systems, A1835 and PKS 0745-191, have extended young stellar populations in their centers with recent star formation rates of 100 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and 8 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. In A1835 we uncover a massive blueshifted clump of young stars moving at high speed with respect to the gas and central galaxy. We suggest this feature is a young population that formed in a gaseous outflow that has detached from its natal gas and is falling back toward the galaxy. This result, combined with a companion study (arXiv:2404.02212) tracing nebular emission which presumably cooled from the hot X-ray atmosphere, indicates that star formation is proceeding in a dynamically complex environment resulting from the central galaxy's motion with respect to the cooling clouds and motion induced by feedback from the central radio jets.

        "abstract": "Supernova (SN) 1987A, with its long-rising ($\\gtrsim$40~days) light curve, defines a rare subclass of type II SNe known as 1987A-like events. Representing only $\\sim$1-3\\% of all core-collapse SNe and often found in low-metallicity environments, their large diversity suggests a wide range of progenitor and explosion properties. This study aims to improve the understanding of 1987A-like SNe by characterizing their explosion parameters, including kinetic energy, ejected mass, progenitor radius at explosion, and synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass. Additionally, it seeks to identify systematic trends in both the physical properties and the observed features of these peculiar events. A new Bayesian parameter estimation method, based on our $^{56}$Ni-dependent analytical model for hydrogen-rich SNe, is applied to derive explosion parameters from the light curves and expansion velocities of one of the largest and most comprehensive 1987A-like SN samples to date. These data are measured through a consistent analysis of observations available in the literature. The analysis reveals a heterogeneous population that nevertheless clusters into two main groups: (i) lower-energy explosions with modest $^{56}$Ni yields ($\\sim$0.07~M$_\\odot$), similar to SN~1987A, and (ii) more energetic events (up to $\\sim$5~foe) with larger nickel production and, in some cases, unusually extended progenitors. We confirm a robust correlation between $^{56}$Ni mass, peak luminosity, and explosion energy, as well as between ejecta mass and recombination timescale. An anti-correlation between Ba~II line strength and photospheric velocity indicates that stronger Ba~II absorptions in 1987A-like SNe arise from more compact, slowly expanding ejecta. Our study underscores the need to extend analytical frameworks to include additional power sources, enabling scalable and accurate modelling of the growing number of peculiar transients.",

        "abstract": "Interstellar extinction is a major obstacle in determining accurate stellar parameters from photometry near the Galactic disk. It is especially true for globular clusters at low galactic latitudes, which suffer from significant amounts of, and spatially variable reddening. Although differential reddening maps are available for tens of clusters, establishing and validating the absolute zero point of relative maps is a challenge. In this study, we present a new approach to determine and evaluate absolute reddening zero-points for Galactic globular clusters by combining three-dimensional reddening maps with Gaia DR3 RR Lyrae data. As a first case study, we investigate the low-latitude globular cluster M9. We compare the Gaia photometry and color data of the cluster member RR Lyrae stars to field RR Lyrae stars with accurate parallaxes and whose photometric metallicities match that of M9, as well as to theoretical models. We calculate the dereddened Gaia colors for the M9 stars based on three zero points. We confirm that the original SFD map appears to be overcorrecting the reddening for at least some RR Lyrae stars, albeit not excessively. In contrast, the 3D Bayestar map and the recalibrated version of the SFD map provide physically plausible reddenings, which we accept as lower and upper limits for M9, respectively. Our results provide a physically motivated reddening range for M9, and outline a methodology that can be directly extended to other globular clusters that are accessible to the Gaia mission, and to other multicolor sky surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory.",

        "abstract": "In the solution of the Jeans equations for axisymmetric galaxy models the ``$b$-ansatz\" is often adopted to prescribe the relation between the vertical and radial components of the velocity dispersion tensor, and close the equations. However, $b$ affects the resulting azimuthal velocity fields quite indirectly, so that the analysis of the model kinematics is usually performed after numerically solving the Jeans equations, a time consuming approach. In a previous work we presented a general method to determine the main properties of the kinematical fields resulting in the $b$-ansatz framework before solving the Jeans equations; results were illustrated by means of disk galaxy models. In this paper we focus more specifically on realistic ellipsoidal galaxy models. It is found that how and where $b$ affects the galaxy kinematical fields is mainly dependent on the flattening of the stellar density distribution, moderately on the presence of a Dark Matter halo, and much less on the specific galaxy density profile. The main trends revealed by the numerical exploration, in particular the fact that more flattened systems can support larger $b$-anisotropy, are explained with the aid of simple ellipsoidal galaxy models, for which most of the analysis can be conducted analytically. The obtained results can be adopted as guidelines for model building and in the interpretation of observational data.",

Our analysis reveals an overall zero-point offset between the 2016 and 2013 datasets. We further identify zero-point offsets for each standard field, ranging from 5 -- 14 mmag across all $UBVRI$ bands, with correlations between offsets in different bands. Additionally, we confirm the spatial structures up to 7 -- 10 mmag in the $BVRI$ bands. We also find that spatial structures are similar across bands for the same field, and similar across different fields for the same band. These similarities may arise from the averaged flat-fields from each observing run. The recalibrated results are consistent with the XPSP data within 48 mmag in the $U$ band, 11 mmag in the $B$ band, and 5 -- 6 mmag in the $VRI$ bands in the brightness $G<16$. Furthermore, based on stellar atmospheric parameters from LAMOST DR12 and Gaia DR3 photometry, along with the XPSP data, we derive temperature- and extinction-dependent extinction coefficients for the $UBVRI$ bands as well as a LAMOST \\& Gaia-based catalog of 5.4 million standard stars in the $UBVRI$ bands, for which the U-band photometry of the vast majority of sources exhibits significantly higher precision than XPSP.

        "abstract": "Measuring one-point statistics in redshifted 21 cm intensity maps offers an opportunity to explore non-Gaussian features of the early universe. We assess the impact of instrumental effects on measurements made with the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) by forward modeling observational and simulation data. Using HERA Phase I observations over 94 nights, we examine the second (m2, variance) and third (m3) moments of images. We employ the DAYENU-filtering method for foreground removal and reduce simulated foreground residuals to 10% of the 21 cm signal residuals. In noiseless cosmological simulations, the amplitudes of one-point statistics measurements are significantly reduced by the instrument response and further reduced by wedge-filtering. Analyses with wedge-filtered observational data, along with expected noise simulations, show that systematics alter the probability distribution of the map pixels. Likelihood analysis based on the observational data shows m2 measurements disfavor the cold reionization model characterized by inefficient X-ray heating, in line with other power spectra measurements. Small signals in m3 due to the instrument response of the Phase I observation and wedge-filtering make it challenging to use these non-Gaussian statistics to explore model parameters. Forecasts with the full HERA array predict high signal-to-noise ratios for m2, m3, and S3 assuming no foregrounds, but wedge-filtering drastically reduces these ratios. This work demonstrates conclusively that a comprehensive understanding of instrumental effects on m2 and m3 is essential for their use as a cosmological probe, given their dependence on the underlying model.",

Using 812{,}118 quasars from DESI DR1 ($0.03 \\leq z \\leq 1.8$), we searched for quasars lensing higher-redshift galaxies by identifying background emission-line features in their spectra. To detect these rare systems, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on mock lenses constructed from real DESI spectra of quasars and emission-line galaxies (ELGs), achieving a high classification performance (AUC = 0.99). We also trained a regression network to estimate the redshift of the background ELG. Applying this pipeline, we identified seven high-quality (Grade~A) lens candidates, each exhibiting a strong [O\\,\\textsc{ii}] doublet at a higher redshift than the foreground quasar; four candidates additionally show H$\\beta$ and [O\\,\\textsc{iii}] emission. These results significantly expand the sample of quasar lens candidates beyond the twelve identified and three confirmed in previous work, and demonstrate the potential for scalable, data-driven discovery of quasars as strong lenses in upcoming spectroscopic surveys.",

This scenario naturally explains the coincidence of baryonic and dark matter abundances without the need for tuning particle masses. In particular, the supersymmetry breaking scales in the visible and dark sectors may differ by up to 10-11 orders of magnitude. We argue that dark neutrons should be the lightest dark baryons, but that dark protons may be cosmologically long lived. This allows a small fraction of dark matter to remain ionized until the first halos start to form, providing cooling mechanisms that foster the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of sub-halo structures, ultimately resulting in dark neutron star and black hole formation. For a wide range of model parameters, we find dark neutron stars with generally smaller mass and radius than ordinary visible sector neutron stars. We also discuss their potential detectability, particularly through gravitational microlensing and dark magnetic dipole radiation at radio frequencies through photon-dark photon kinetic mixing.",

        "abstract": "Neutron stars (NSs) are interesting objects capable of reaching densities unattainable on Earth. The properties of matter under these conditions remain a mystery. Exotic matter, including quark matter, may be present in the NS core. In this work, we explore the possible compositions of NS cores, in particular, the possible existence of large quark cores. We use the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model with nonlinear terms for the hadron phase and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and Mean Field Theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (MFTQCD) for the quark phase. Through Bayesian inference, we obtain different sets of equations: four sets with hybrid equations (three using the NJL model and the other using the MFTQCD model), and one set with only the hadron phase. We impose constraints regarding the properties of nuclear matter, X-ray observational data from NICER, perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations, and causality on all sets. One set of hybrid NJL equations of state was also constrained by adding the GW170817 detection. All sets can describe observational data and theoretical restrictions. The MFTQCD allows for a phase transition to quark matter at lower densities compared to the NJL models. The MFTQCD model indicates that NSs with 1.4 solar mass have quark matter in their inner core. However, NJL models suggest that it is more probable that 1.4 solar mass NSs do not contain quark matter. Both the MFTQCD and NJL models agree that there is quark matter in 2 solar mass NSs. It is discussed that hybrid stars with a stiff quark equation of state could explain a larger radius of more massive stars, such as two solar mass stars, with respect to the canonical NS.",

        "abstract": "CMB-S4 is the fourth-generation ground-based cosmic microwave background project, designed to probe the early universe and cosmic inflation. CMB-S4 would achieve its science goals in part by dramatically increasing the number of transition edge sensor (TES) bolometer detectors on the sky. The detector readout system for CMB-S4 is time-division multiplexing (TDM) with a two-stage Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) system. To accommodate the large increase in detectors, the size of our camera increases, placing physical constraints on the readout, its wiring, and its power dissipation. Therefore, to optimize readout performance, we need to balance competing design considerations such as thermal load and bandwidth. We present results characterizing the thermal and electrical performance of prototype components, including wiring and SQUID arrays for CMB-S4, and discuss the impact on overall system performance.",

        "title": "Measurement of angular cross-correlation between the cosmological dispersion measure and the thermal Sunyaev--Zeldovich effect",
        "abstract": "The dispersion measures (${\\rm DMs}$) from fast radio bursts (FRBs) and the thermal Sunyaev--Zeldovich (tSZ) effect probe the free-electron density and pressure, respectively, in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the intervening galaxies and clusters. Their combination enables disentangling the gas density and temperature. In this work, we present the first detection of an angular cross-correlation between the ${\\rm DMs}$ and the Compton $y$ parameter of the tSZ effect. The theoretical expectation is calculated using the halo model $\\texttt{HMx}$, calibrated with hydrodynamic simulations. The observational cross-correlation is measured over angular separations of $1^\\prime$--$1000^\\prime$ using the ${\\rm DMs}$ from $133$ localized FRBs and the $y$-maps from the Planck satellite and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). We detect a positive correlation with amplitudes of $\\mathcal{A}=2.26 \\pm 0.56$ ($4.0 \\sigma$) for Planck and $\\mathcal{A}=1.38 \\pm 0.92$ ($1.5 \\sigma$) for ACT, where $\\mathcal{A}=1$ corresponds to the theoretical prediction of the Planck 2018 $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Assuming an isothermal gas, the measured amplitude implies an average electron temperature of $\\approx 2 \\times 10^7 \\, {\\rm K}$. The correlation is highly sensitive to the matter clustering parameter $\\sigma_8$, and its dependence on other cosmological and astrophysical parameters -- such as the ionized fraction, the Hubble constant, and baryon feedback -- differs from that of the ${\\rm DM}$ alone. This suggests that future joint analyses of the ${\\rm DMs}$ and the tSZ effect could help break degeneracies among these parameters.",

        "title": "A Correlation Between the Final Separation and Mass Ratio from Common Envelope Simulations",
        "abstract": "Analytical models for common envelope evolution (CEE), particularly the energy formalism, are used in binary population synthesis to predict post-CEE configurations. This formalism is based on an efficiency parameter alpha, which relates the orbital energy released during CEE to that required to unbind the envelope of the giant. However, one of the main challenges is that CEE is a multiscale, multiphysics process. As a result, there may not be a universal value for alpha, or even a general expression. Using 13 3D simulations of CEE with RGBs (1 and 2 M$_\\odot$ primary; four mass ratios; with and without corotation), we present an empirical linear correlation between the post-plunge-in separation and the mass ratio, normalized by the giant radius. This trend for the plunge-in phase of CEE persists across RGB, AGB, and supergiant simulations in the literature, even for partially bound envelopes. Therefore, alpha from simulations should not be used to predict the final separation, but rather as a diagnostic of whether sufficient orbital energy has been liberated to completely eject the envelope immediately after the radial plunge. If this condition is not met, further in-spiral is expected in later stages of CEE, which may explain why the final separation of post-CEE observations is generally smaller than those predicted by the linear fit. Our results reinforce the idea that a better description could emerge if CEE is treated as a sequence of distinct phases, rather than treating it as a single event governed by alpha.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the kinematical and dynamical properties of quiescent cluster galaxies with weak emission lines, referred to as retired (R), and those without emission lines, dubbed passive (P), to better understand the origin of the ionized gas in R galaxies and what drives the differences between these populations. We stack 2,907 P and 2,387 R galaxies from 336 relaxed galaxy clusters to build an ensemble cluster and estimate their projected number density and velocity dispersion profiles, $\\sigma_P(R)$, as well as their projected phase-space (PPS) distributions. Additionally, we apply the MAMPOSSt code and the Jeans equation inversion technique to constrain the velocity anisotropy profiles, $\\beta(r)$. We find that P galaxies tend to reside closer to the cluster centres than R galaxies, and that both populations exhibit similar $\\sigma_P(R)$ and $\\beta(r)$ profiles, regardless of their stellar mass, stellar age, or morphology. The only exception is elliptical R galaxies, which are marginally more concentrated and display more radial orbits than their P counterparts. PPS analyses indicate that R galaxies were, on average, accreted later than P galaxies, except for those with $D_n4000 > 1.86$ or elliptical morphology. These results suggest that R galaxies, though accreted more recently, have already had enough time to evolve towards a dynamical state more consistent with that of the dynamically relaxed P population. Finally, our findings suggest that the ionized gas in early-type R galaxies likely originates from accretion from their own hot gas haloes, and that its removal triggers the transition toward the P phase over relatively long timescales.",

We estimated the physical properties of the components of the system for the four measured parallax given by Gaia and Hipparcos, which gives a dynamical mass sum ranges between 2.43 and 2.52 solar mass using the new orbital parameters following Tokovinin's dynamical method. The method used is a spectrophotometrical computational technique that employs Kurucz plane-parallel line-blanketed model atmospheres for single stars. These model atmospheres are used to construct the synthetic spectral energy distributions (SED) of each component and for the entire system. To ensure the method's accuracy, we apply the fit between synthetic and observational photometry under different filters, including the recently published Gaia DR3 measurements. The positions of the components on the H-R diagram and the evolutionary tracks were used to estimate their masses and ages. We found that the system consists of 2.24 Gyr two F2.5 IV and F3.5 IV subgiant components with T_eff_A= 6800, T_eff_B= 6700, logg=4.19 m/s^2, logg=4.33 m/s^2, R_A=1.77 R_sun, R_B=1.34 R_sun, L_A=6.01 L_sun, L_B=3.25 L_sun and Z=0.011.   Depending on the masses estimated by Al-Wardat's method, a new parallax value of 28.72+-0.30 mas was obtained. Which lies between the values given by DR2 and DR3.

        "abstract": "A comprehensive investigation of nonradial oscillations in neutron star (NS) admixed with gravitationally bounded dark matter (DM) is carried out within the framework of full general relativity. The relativistic mean field (RMF) formalism is employed to illustrate the hadronic equation of state (EOS), while a physically motivated, gravitationally captured, non-uniform fermionic Higgs-portal DM component is incorporated to model DM-admixed NS. The DM distribution is characterized by two free parameters: $\\alpha M_\\chi$, an effective scaling factor that combines the DM concentration and the DM candidate mass, and $\\beta$, a steepness index controlling the DM density distribution. The quasi normal mode (QNM) characteristics such as fundamental ($f$) mode frequency and its corresponding gravitational-wave (GW) damping time ($\\tau$) is calculated for DM-admixed NS by solving the general relativistic perturbed equations involving axial as well as polar modes. The study demonstrates how the inclusion of DM distribution modifies the $f$-mode frequency and enhances the damping rate, reflecting a stronger coupling between matter and spacetime perturbations. Considering DM effects, the correlation analysis among DM model parameters, NS observables and QNM characteristics also carried out. Analytic fits for the $f-C-\\tau$ and $f-\\Lambda -\\tau$ relations are constructed and calibrated for DM-admixed NS models. Building upon asteroseismic universal relations (URs), multimessenger constraint from the GW170817 event is employed by mapping the tidal deformability $\\Lambda_{1.4}$ into the $(f_{1.4},\\tau_{1.4})$ space, thereby providing observational bounds on the oscillation properties of canonical DM-admixed NS model.",

A sample of synthetic light curves for overcontact binaries consists of 89670, covering a parameter space typical of overcontact systems. On the basis of a recent study that proposed a new classification scheme using light-curve derivatives up to the fourth order, the sample light curves were classified. We found that time intervals between two local extrema in the derivatives are associated with the mass ratio in systems that exhibit a high degree of eclipse obscuration. Using regression analysis for the identified associations, we derived empirical formulae to estimate the mass ratio and its associated uncertainty. The application of our proposed method to real overcontact binary data demonstrated its effectiveness in providing reliable estimates for both values.",

This opens the possibility of a one-to-one model of a target region over an extensive time period. We use a hybrid strategy that combines fast-evolving idealized zero-$\\beta$ models that capture the evolution of the large-scale active region magnetic field over a long time period and sophisticated radiative MHD models for a shorter time period of interest. Synthesized EUV images illustrate the formation of coronal loops that connect the two sunspots or fan out to the domain boundary. The model reveals in three-dimensional space the finer structures in the coronal heating and plasma properties, which are usually concealed behind the EUV observables. The emission-measure-weighted line-of-sight velocity, which represents the Doppler shift of a spectral line forming in a certain temperature range, reveals vigorous dynamics in plasma at different temperatures and ubiquitous MHD waves, as expected in the real solar corona.",

We demonstrate that fits of this ringdown signal using two quasinormal modes are statistically preferred over single-mode fits, for a broad range of fit start times. We also find that two-mode fits give remnant mass and spin measurements consistent with those of the inspiral-merger-ringdown model NRSur7dq4, whereas one-mode fits struggle to do so. Agreement of our fits with those of NRSur7dq4 is achieved by labeling the two quasinormal modes as the ${(\\ell,m)=(2,2)}$ and ${(2,0)}$ Kerr prograde fundamental modes. However, we find some indications that fits with the ${(2,1)}$ quasinormal mode instead of the ${(2,0)}$ mode may describe the data better, hinting at possible NRSur7dq4 error or other systematics. When fitting at early times near the estimated peak strain, we find that the inclusion of a third mode, an ${(\\ell,m,n)=(2,2,1)}$ prograde overtone, improves consistency with fits at later times. Finally, we perform a test of general relativity by searching for deviations from the Kerr frequency spectrum. Setting issues of systematics aside, we validate the Kerr frequency and damping rate spectrum to within $\\pm10\\%$ at the 90$\\%$ credible level using a fundamental mode fit, and we also report $\\pm8\\%$ constraints using a model with fundamental modes and an overtone fit at times near the peak strain. Understanding the systematic errors that may be affecting the most accurate analyses of GW231123 is crucial in the context of population and binary formation studies -- our ${(2,1)}$ mode fits return a significantly higher remnant mass and spin than all available inspiral-merger-ringdown models including NRSur7dq4, and this difference in parameter estimates may have astrophysical implications.",

Working in the two-fluid approximation, we show how particles can be \"painted on\" to a force-free solution as a function of boundary conditions that encode the particle output of \"gap regions\" where the force-free approximation does not hold. These boundary conditions also determine the leading parallel electric field in the entire magnetosphere. Our treatment holds in a general (possibly curved) spacetime and is phrased in language intrinsic to the 1+1 dimensional \"field sheet spacetimes\" experienced by particles stuck to magnetic field lines. Besides the new results, this provides an elegant formulation of some standard equations; for example, we show that the zero-gyroradius guiding center approximation is just the Lorentz force law on the field sheet. We derive a general perturbative method and apply it to pulsar and black hole magnetospheres with radial magnetic fields to produce fully analytic models that capture key features of the full problem. When applied to more realistic magnetic field configurations together with simulation-informed boundary conditions for the gap regions, this approach has the potential to provide global magnetosphere models without the need for global particle-in-cell simulations.",

Through complete diagonalization of the functional Hessian, we systematically delineate the parameter space into distinct sectors characterized by stability properties and spectral structure. We identify subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes; strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature, diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis.

Although such micro-black holes evaporate rapidly via Hawking radiation, their formation modifies the post-inflationary equation of state and their evaporation can successfully reheat the Universe before Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

        "abstract": "We re-examine the case for dark matter (DM) produced by ultra-relativistic freeze-out (UFO). UFO is the mechanism by which Standard Model (SM) neutrinos decouple from the radiation bath in the early universe at a temperature $T_{d} \\approx 1$ MeV. This corresponds to chemical freeze-out without Boltzmann suppression, such that the freeze-out (decoupling) temperature $T_{d}$ is much greater than $m_{\\nu}$ and the neutrinos are therefore ultra-relativistic at freeze-out. While UFO has historically been rejected as a viable mechanism for DM production due to its association with hot DM and the accompanying incompatibility with $\\Lambda$CDM, we show that when the approximation of instantaneous reheating after inflation is lifted, UFO can produce cold DM and account for the entire observed relic density in large regions of parameter space. In fact, DM with masses ranging from sub-eV to PeV scales can undergo UFO and be cold before structure formation, given only a simple perturbative, post-inflationary reheating period prior to radiation domination. For some interactions, such as a contact interaction between the Higgs and DM scalars, there is a seamless transition between the WIMP and FIMP regimes which excludes UFO. However, for many other interactions, such as SM fermions producing fermionic DM via a heavy scalar or vector mediator, the WIMP to FIMP transition occurs \\textit{necessarily} via a large intermediate region corresponding to UFO. We characterize the general features of UFO in this paper, while we supply a more detailed analysis in a companion paper. We find that UFO during reheating can produce the correct relic density ($\\Omega_{\\chi}h^2 = 0.12$) for DM masses spanning about 13 orders of magnitude, reheating temperatures spanning 17 orders of magnitude, and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) effective interaction scales spanning 11 orders of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "Pulsar Timing Arrays provide a powerful framework to measure low-frequency gravitational waves, but accuracy and robustness of the results are challenged by complex noise processes that must be accurately modeled. Standard PTA analyses assign fixed uniform noise priors to each pulsar, an approach that can introduce systematic biases when combining the array. To overcome this limitation, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian modeling strategy in which noise priors are parametrized by higher-level hyperparameters. We further address the challenge posed by the correlations between hyperparameters and physical noise parameters, focusing on those describing red noise and dispersion measure variations. To decorrelate these quantities, we introduce an orthogonal reparametrization of the hierarchical model implemented with Normalizing Flows. We also employ i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to efficiently explore the resulting higher-dimensional parameter space. We apply our method to a minimal 3-pulsar case study, performing a simultaneous inference of noise and SGWB parameters. Despite the limited dataset, the results consistently show that the hierarchical treatment constrains the noise parameters more tightly and partially alleviates the red-noise-SGWB degeneracy, while the orthogonal reparametrization further enhances parameter independence without affecting the correlations intrinsic to the power-law modeling of the physical processes involved.",

In this context, an accurate analysis of the optical emission, which is mostly dominated by the companion star, is essential for a comprehensive characterization of these systems and their role within their environment. In this work, we present a multi-wavelength investigation of five binary MSPs in the Galactic GC M3 (NGC 5272) using archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. Our analysis builds on the timing solutions obtained with the FAST radio Telescope by Li et al. (2024). For each MSP, we carry out precise astrometric cross-matching with the accurate radio positions to identify potential counterparts. When a match is found, we analyse its location in the colour-magnitude diagrams and compare the results with updated binary evolution models to infer the system properties. We confirm the identification of the optical companion to M3B, matching the source previously reported by Cadelano et al. (2019), and successfully identify and characterize the optical companions to M3D and M3F. All three are consistent with helium white dwarfs, as expected from the canonical formation scenario. For M3A and M3E, no reliable counterparts are found, but we place strong upper limits on the brightness and mass of the undetected companion. In the case of M3E, we detect a red object near the radio position in two F814W observations; however, astrometric measurements over a 15-year baseline reveal a significant proper motion inconsistent with cluster membership, identifying the source as a foreground contaminant. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining precise radio timing with deep, multi-band HST images to uncover and constrain the nature of MSP companions in GCs, offering insights into their formation and evolutionary histories.",

For the first time, we analyze approximately four years of Kepler data alongside TESS observations. Furthermore, TESS observations obtained in 120-second cadence mode, constitute the highest-precision photometric dataset for DF Cyg to date. By isolating long-term trends in the TESS data, we quantified short-term variations in the fundamental pulsation frequency and its integer harmonics. The two alternating short-term cycles in the TESS light curve facilitated the unambiguous identification of seven previously undetected integer harmonics of the fundamental frequency in the power spectrum, providing critical new insights into the star's complex pulsation dynamics. A periodogram analysis of the combined ground- and space-based datasets revealed approximately 35 frequencies linked to both long- and short-term variability mechanisms. Stellar parameters derived from Gaia DR3 data specifically, luminosity and radius estimates based on Type II Cepheid PL and PR relations demonstrate consistency with values obtained through SED modeling. Complementary high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of DF Cyg yielded atmospheric parameters of Teff = 4781 K, logg = 1.74 dex, and [FeH] = -0.07 dex, further constraining physical characteristics of the star. This synthesis of multi-epoch, multi-instrument data advances the understanding of pulsational behavior and evolutionary status in RV Tauri systems.

The resulting model retains the original dependencies on velocity dispersion and surface brightness, but introduces physically interpretable corrections that significantly improve the fit to real data. Using a large galaxy sample, we demonstrate that this extended FP achieves a higher level of accuracy than the classical form, with all parameters showing strong statistical significance.

The $\\beta$4 model generally produces broader and more blueshifted low-velocity components across all tracers, consistent with compact emission regions and steep velocity gradients. The $\\beta$6 and PE models yield narrower profiles with smaller blueshifts, in better agreement with most observed narrow low-velocity components (NLVCs). We also find that some line profile diagnostics, such as the inclination at maximum centroid velocity, are not robust discriminants. However, the overall blueshift and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the low-velocity components provide reliable constraints. The $\\beta$4 model reproduces the most extreme blueshifted NLVCs in observations, while most observed winds are more consistent with the $\\beta$6 and PE models. Our findings reinforce previous conclusions that most observed NLVCs are compatible with weakly magnetised or purely photoevaporative flows. The combination of line kinematics and emission morphology offers meaningful constraints on wind-driving physics.",

The Be primary is traced by broad H alpha wings, while narrow metallic absorption lines arise from a slowly rotating companion. The interferometric separation implies a dynamical distance of 888+/-5 pc. The spectral energy distribution is reproduced with E(B-V)=0.321+/-0.016 and a viscous decretion disk of base density rho_0~5x10^12 g cm^-3 at r=R_eq, declining radially as rho(r)~r^-n with n=3.0. The companion is luminous and inflated, with T_eff=10.0(+0.2,-0.1) kK, R_comp=13.1+/-0.2 R_sun, and log(L/L_sun)=3.19, contributing significantly to the flux (L_comp/L_Be~0.3). Spectral line mismatches further suggest a hydrogen-poor, CNO-processed atmosphere, consistent with a stripped-envelope star. HD 698 thus adds to the emerging class of Be+bloated OB binaries, capturing a brief post-mass-transfer phase when the donor remains spectroscopically detectable prior to the subdwarf stage.",

There are, however, three main types of quintessence models: thawing quintessence, scaling freezing quintessence, and tracking quintessence.

        "abstract": "ASASSN-24fw is a main-sequence F-type star that experienced a rapid and long-lasting dimming event beginning in late 2024 and continuing until mid 2025. Its pre-dimming spectral energy distribution shows a persistent infrared excess with a fractional luminosity of approximately 0.5 percent. We model this excess using a two-component blackbody fit and find dust components with temperatures of about 1070 K and 390 K. Archival light curves indicate that ASASSN-24fw was photometrically stable prior to the event, suggesting that the dimming is caused by an external occulting body rather than intrinsic stellar variability. The event lasted about 275 days and exhibits a distinctive flat-bottomed profile of nearly 200 days, unlike most long-duration occultation events reported in the last decade. We analyze the light curve and spectra obtained during dimming to study the properties of both the star and the occulting material. A parametric light-curve model reveals multiple ingress phases, consistent with variations in the density and structure of the obscuring material. A second transit model favors an occulting body consistent with a gas giant or brown dwarf with a minimum mass of about 3.4 Jupiter masses and surrounded by an extended circumplanetary disk or rings of radius roughly 0.17 au. Near-infrared spectra taken during dimming show enhanced infrared excess and spectral features consistent with a late-type companion, approximately M8. We also detect variable H-alpha emission, suggesting evolving gas and dust in the occulting structure. Imaging from LCOGT identifies a nearby object within 3 arcsec, likely a bound companion at a projected separation of about 3000 au. Systems like ASASSN-24fw appear rare, and continued follow-up will help constrain the nature of the occulting body and the circumstellar environment.",

        "abstract": "Accretion processes in the planetary-mass regime remain poorly constrained, yet they strongly influence planet formation, evolution, and the composition of circumplanetary disks (CPDs). We investigate the resolved Balmer hydrogen emission-line profiles and their variability in the ~13Mjup, 30-45 Myr-old companion Delorme to constrain the underlying accretion mechanisms. Using VLT/UVES, we obtained 31 new epochs of high-resolution optical spectra (330-680 nm, R = 50,000), probing variability from hours to years. We analyze the shape and flux variability of hydrogen emission lines and compare them to two proposed origins: magnetospheric accretion funnels and localized accretion shocks. We detect Balmer lines from Halpha to H10 (6564-3799 AA) and a UV continuum excess, both indicative of ongoing accretion. All features are variable. The hydrogen lines decompose into two static components that vary only in flux. The broader velocity component correlates strongly with the UV excess and is qualitatively consistent with magnetospheric funnel models, but not with shock models. This component dominates the shape variability. The narrower component, which correlates less with the UV excess, is better matched by shock-emission models and drives most of the flux variability. Line fluxes show low variability on hour timescales but up to ~100% over weeks, similar to T Tauri stars. Our findings support magnetospheric accretion as the origin of the broad component. The narrow component may arise from accretion shocks or chromospheric activity. Higher-cadence observations could reveal rotational modulations and help constrain the object's rotation period and accretion geometry.",

        "abstract": "Context. Three kilometer-sized interstellar objects (ISOs) have been detected transiting the Solar System, and spacecraft have directly measured micrometer-scale interstellar dust (ISD). Yet no intermediate-size interstellar meteoroids have been identified in current meteor surveys.   Aims. We test whether a power-law flux extrapolation connecting spacecraft ISD and kilometer-scale ISOs is consistent with meteor surveys, and we quantify the expected interstellar impacting flux based on various observational reports.   Methods. We compiled differential fluxes and limits from spacecraft ISD, radar and optical meteor surveys, and theoretical estimates. We evaluated the power-law size-frequency fits, computed the 3I-like flux, and compared measured fluxes to predictions.   Results. The spacecraft-measured dust flux exceeds extrapolations constrained by meteor surveys and kilometer-scale ISOs by $\\sim$2-7 orders of magnitude. An $r^{-3.0}$ fit combining spacecraft ISD detections with kilometer-scale ISOs overpredicts the number of meteors with hyperbolic orbits, whereas slopes of $r^{-2.7}$-$r^{-2.3}$ (derived from radar and optical meteor upper limits, respectively) instead yield interplanetary-to-interstellar flux ratios of $10^{3}$-$10^{6}$.   Conclusions. A simple power-law from ISD to ISOs is inconsistent with meteor survey constraints and yields unrealistic predictions for interstellar meteoroids. The data reveal a gap between submicron dust entrained in the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) and macroscopic bodies ejected from planetary systems. This gap may reflect distinct origins and destruction-transport processes rather than a continuous size-frequency distribution. This would imply either the dominance of a small-particle LIC component or the need to reassess spacecraft dust fluxes.",

From a total of 27 hours of radio and 29 hours of optical observations, we examine the correspondence of the action of accelerated electrons of different energies in two distinct regions of the stellar atmosphere. We find that out of 9 optical flares with suitable radio coverage, only four have plausible evidence for a radio response. Optical photometric properties cannot predict which flares will have a radio response. From flares with time-resolved optical spectroscopy available, optical-only flares have similar implied electron distributions, while those with radio responses better correlate with higher low-energy cutoffs. The optical flares with a radio response all exhibit a delay between the optical and radio peaks of $\\approx$1-7 minutes, with the optical flare peaking earlier in all cases. This likely indicates multiple loops are involved in the event, and/or the different impacts on electrons trapped in a magnetic loop (producing radio emission), versus those directly precipitating from the loop (producing the optical flare). We also remark on the radio spectral index behavior at early times for the largest radio flare observed in this study, which we interpret as evidence for increased opacity from a chromospheric evaporation front.",

For a sample of high-likelihood small-separation binaries, we found binaries to host 58% fewer planets per system than single stars to 11.4$\\sigma$ significance within 1-4 $R_{\\oplus}$ and 1-50 d, and 50% fewer planets compared to single stars when integrating over the full parameter space of 1-10 $R_{\\oplus}$ and 1-100 d to 3.8$\\sigma$ significance.. We found no evidence for a radius valley or radius cliff, instead detecting a smooth decline in planet occurrence with increasing planetary radius. The difference between the single-star planet radius distribution and the binary-star planet radius distribution is 4.3$\\sigma$ significant from a Kolomogorov-Smirnov test.

        "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely bright, millisecond duration cosmic transients of unknown origin. The growing number of wide-field and high-time-resolution radio surveys, particularly with next-generation facilities such as the SKA and MeerKAT, will dramatically increase FRB discovery rates, but also produce data volumes that overwhelm conventional search pipelines. Real-time detection thus demands software that is both algorithmically robust and computationally efficient. We present Astroflow, an end-to-end, GPU-accelerated pipeline for single-pulse detection in radio time-frequency data. Built on a unified C++/CUDA core with a Python interface, Astroflow integrates RFI excision, incoherent dedispersion, dynamic-spectrum tiling, and a YOLO-based deep detector. Through vectorized memory access, shared-memory tiling, and OpenMP parallelism, it achieves 10x faster-than-real-time processing on consumer GPUs for a typical 150 s, 2048-channel observation, while preserving high sensitivity across a wide range of pulse widths and dispersion measures. These results establish the feasibility of a fully integrated, GPU-accelerated single-pulse search stack, capable of scaling to the data volumes expected from upcoming large-scale surveys. Astroflow offers a reusable and deployable solution for real-time transient discovery, and provides a framework that can be continuously refined with new data and models.",

        "abstract": "Since their discovery more than 60 years ago, accreting supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) were recognized as highly variable sources, requiring an extremely compact, dynamic environment. Their variability traces to multiple phenomena, including changing accretion rates, temperature changes, foreground absorbers, and structural changes to the accretion disk. Spurred by a new generation of time-domain surveys, the extremes of black hole variability are now being probed. We report the discovery of an extreme flare by the AGN J224554.84+374326.5, which brightened by more than a factor of 40 in 2018. The source has slowly faded since then. The total emitted UV/optical energy to date is $\\sim10^{54}$ erg, i.e., the complete conversion of approximately one solar mass into electromagnetic radiation. This flare is 30 times more powerful than the previous most powerful AGN transient. Very few physical events in the Universe can liberate this much electromagnetic energy. We discuss potential mechanisms, including the tidal disruption of a high mass $(>30\\, M_\\odot)$ star, gravitational lensing of an AGN flare or supernova, or a supermassive (pair instability) supernova in the accretion disk of an AGN. We favor the tidal disruption of a massive star in a prograde orbit in an AGN disk.",

        "abstract": "The full extended Gaia mission spans slightly over 10 years of data, whilst the current data releases represent only a fraction of that timescale (DR3, 34 months). The longer baseline improves the quality of astrometric fits, lowering the noise floor and making consistently bad fits (for example, due to binarity) more apparent. In this paper, we use simulated binaries from the Gaia Universe Model to examine the long-term astrometric behaviour of single stars and stellar binaries. We calculate nominal upper limits on the spread of goodness of astrometric fits for well-behaved single stars. Specifically, for the RUWE parameter, for upcoming DR4 ($\\rm RUWE_{lim}=1.15$) and DR5 ($\\rm RUWE_{lim}=1.11$), using the full mission nominal scanning law. These can be used to identify poor astrometric fits, and in particular can flag potential binary systems. We show the increase in the number and type of binaries detectable through RUWE. With our updated RUWE thresholds, the number of detectable low-period binaries increases by 5-10% with each subsequent data release, suggesting detections may be possible for orbital periods down to days. The number of detectable long-period systems increases by 10-20%, with periods up to 100 years, causing significant deviations in low moderate-eccentricity binaries. Very eccentric systems with much longer periods (thousands of years) can still be detected if they pass through periapse during the observing window. Finally, we compare our results to the analytic estimate for the spread in UWE, which we predict from a $\\chi$-distribution moderated by the number of observations. These agree with our inferred population limits but suggest that we may be biased by a small number of poorly sampled systems. In regions of the sky that are more frequently observed, lower limits could be employed, potentially bringing even more binaries above the threshold for detectability.",

In particular, we restrict our analysis to the osculating Barthel-Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric function is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\\alpha$ and of the one-form $\\beta$. In this framework we also consider the role of the conformal transformations of the metric, which allows to introduce a family of conformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models obtained in this way are described by second order field equations, in the presence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The generalized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the Riemannian metric $\\alpha$ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker representation. In order to close the cosmological field equations we assume a specific relationship between the component of the one-form $\\beta$ and the conformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is determined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free parameter $\\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel-Kropina cosmological models are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of $\\gamma$. A comparison with the predictions of standard $\\Lambda$CDM model is also performed. Our results indicate that the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina model can be considered as a successful, and simple, alternative to standard cosmological models.",

However, the presence of multiple past and ongoing mergers indicates that it is an active node within the Abell 85/87/89 complex. We present a weak gravitational lensing (WL) analysis using Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging data to understand its assembly history by investigating the dark matter components of the substructures. Our mass reconstruction resolves three substructures associated with the brightest cluster galaxy (main), the southern (S) subcluster, and the southwestern (SW) subcluster, with WL peak significances of $> 6\\sigma$, $> 5\\sigma$, and $> 4\\sigma$, respectively. The locations of these mass peaks are consistent with those of the member galaxies.

We also present GNIRS spectroscopy confirming the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) to the southwest of PJ1053+60 ($AGN_{SW}$) at $z_{SW}$ = 1.373 $\\pm$ 0.006. Using this redshift prior, we decompose the X-ray spectrum of PJ1053+60 into $AGN_{SW}$ and high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) components from the HyLIRG. The HMXB component has an unusually high luminosity, $\\sim$ 50 times higher than calibration derived from local galaxies, and a characteristic photon index likely too flat to be caused by high-mass X-ray binaries at rest frame energies above a few keV. Our 2-D spatial decomposition also suggests a similarly high X-ray HMXB luminosity, although the limited spatial resolution prevents meaningful morphological constraints on the component. We conclude that the enhanced X-ray emission may only be explained by the presence of another AGN ($AGN_{FG}$) embedded in the foreground group lensing the PJ1053+60 system. The presence of $AGN_{FG}$ is further supported by the detection of a point-like radio continuum source that coincides with the brightest group galaxy (BGG) of the foreground lens. Our study demonstrates the limited capability of current X-ray observatories while highlighting the need for higher angular resolution observations to definitively characterize the nature of X-ray emission in distant, strongly lensed HyLIRGs.",

Using the Fisher-bias formalism, we reconstruct minimal, data-driven $\\eta(z)$ profiles that capture the late-time deviations required to reconcile early- and late-Universe calibrations. While a constant DDR offset preserves the Pantheon-inferred matter density $\\Omega_m = 0.334 \\pm 0.018$--leaving its inconsistency with the Planck best-fit $\\Lambda$CDM model and weak-lensing surveys unresolved--a time-varying DDR substantially reduces cross-dataset inconsistencies and improves the global fit, yielding $\\Delta\\chi^2 \\simeq -10$ relative to $\\Lambda$CDM when the SH0ES prior is excluded. This result suggests that the $\\Omega_m$ discrepancy may represent indirect evidence for a time-varying DDR. A hybrid scenario combining a time-dependent DDR with a phantom-like dark energy transition achieves the most consistent global reconciliation, reducing the tension with DES-Y3 measurements to below $2\\sigma$. These findings indicate that a mild DDR violation, coupled with evolving dark energy, offers a coherent pathway toward jointly addressing the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions.",

This can leave the misleading impression of the Sun as a bright ball in a dark void, rather than revealing it as the dynamic, structured source of the solar wind and space weather. A variety of enhancement algorithms have been developed to address this challenge, each with its own strengths and tradeoffs. We introduce the Radial Histogram Equalizing Filter (RHEF), a novel hybrid technique that optimizes contrast in high dynamic range solar images. By combining the spatial awareness of radial graded filters with the perceptual benefits of histogram equalization, RHEF reveals faint coronal structures and works out of the box -- without requiring careful parameter tuning or prior dataset characterization. RHEF operates independently on each frame, and it enhances on-disk and off-limb features uniformly across the field of view. For additional control, we also present the Upsilon redistribution function -- a symmetrized cousin of gamma correction -- as an optional post-processing step that provides intuitive programmatic tonal compression. We benchmark RHEF against established methods and offer guidance on filter selection across various applications, with examples from multiple solar instruments provided in an appendix. Implemented and available in both Python sunkit_image and IDL, RHEF enables immediate improvements in solar coronal visualization.",

Although compactness is a well-known signature for distinguishing between two branches of QSs and neutron stars (NSs), some QSs can overlap with NSs in the radius-mass plane. To manifest their evident differences, we investigate the tidal properties of QSs and NSs. We then find that the magnetic-type Love number is a robust indicator for differentiating between QSs and NSs, whereas the electric-type one is insufficient when QSs and NSs have similar masses and radii. Finally, we show that gravitational waves from binary star mergers can be sensitive to differences between QSs and NSs to the detectable level.",

A radio source catalogue of 1027 sources statistically matches with similar observations at different frequencies within the sensitivity range of the uGMRT. The calibrated data is further used to characterise the dominant foreground, the Diffuse Galactic Synchrotron Emission (DGSE), in angular scale and frequency regime. We derived the angular power spectrum (APS) of DGSE in two ways: image-based estimator (i-APS) and visibility-based Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE; hereafter as t-APS). We assess the characteristics of DGSE with a power-law form of $C_{\\ell} = A({1000}/{\\ell})^{\\beta}$. Combining data from Band-2 and earlier Band-3 observations, we derived a spectral variation of $C_{\\ell}$ in the form of $C_{\\ell} = A{\\nu^{-2{\\alpha}}}{\\ell^{-{\\beta}}}$.

        "abstract": "Does the environment of a galaxy directly influence the kinematics of its bar? We present observational evidence that bars in high-density environments exhibit significantly slower rotation rates than bars in low-density environments. Galactic bars are central, extended structures composed of stars, dust and gas, present in approximately 30 to 70 per cent of luminous spiral galaxies in the local Universe. Recent simulation studies have suggested that the environment can influence the bar rotation rate, $R$, which is used to classify bars as either fast ($1\\leq R \\leq1.4$) or slow ($R \\gt 1.4$). We use estimates of $R$ obtained with the Tremaine-Weinberg method applied to Integral Field Unit spectroscopy from MaNGA and CALIFA. After cross-matching these with the projected neighbour density, $\\log\\Sigma$, we retain 286 galaxies. The analysis reveals that bars in high-density environments are significantly slower (median $R = 1.67^{+0.72}_{-0.42}$) compared to bars in low-density environments (median $R = 1.37^{+0.51}_{-0.34}$); Anderson-Darling $\\textit{p}$-value of $p_{\\mathrm{AD}}= 0.002$ ($3.1\\,\\sigma$). This study marks the first empirical test of the hypothesis that fast bars are formed by global instabilities in isolated galaxies, while slow bars are triggered by tidal interactions in dense environments, in agreement with predictions from numerous $\\textit{N}$-body simulations. Future studies would benefit from a larger sample of galaxies with reliable Integral Field Unit data, required to measure bar rotation rates. Specifically, more data are necessary to study the environmental influence on bar formation within dense settings (i.e. groups, clusters and filaments).",

Within less than a day, the source evolved from a type-C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) state, with centroid frequencies between 3-5 Hz, to the Heartbeat state, characterized by a broad peak in the power density spectrum at ~25 mHz, corresponding to a ~40 s modulation period. As the source evolved, it passed through a transition track where the QPO features weakened and ultimately disappeared in the Heartbeat state. In the hardness-intensity Diagram, the QPOs occur at higher hardness and lower intensity, followed by a brightening phase as the source moved towards the soft intermediate state, and finally reached the Heartbeat state through a transition towards lower hardness. In the power-color diagram, this transition is marked by a clear shift to a distinct region of power color space, separate from the range occupied by other observed states. This work establishes 4U 1630-47 as another system, apart from GRS 1915+105, where a continuous transition from QPO to Heartbeat state has been observed. Notably, 4U 1630-47 is the only system where the QPO is absent during the heartbeat state. This provides us with another probe to understand the physical mechanism governing this transition and the overall accretion mechanism in BHXRBs.",

Our aims are twofold: Firstly, we investigate whether a single set of model parameters can reproduce the observational constraints of non-irradiated and irradiated discs. Secondly, we propose a novel approach to break degeneracies between the two evolution scenarios by studying the relation of stellar accretion rate and externally driven wind mass-loss rates, which evolve differently depending on the mechanism of angular momentum transport in the outer disc. We evolve synthetic populations of protoplanetary discs using 1D vertically integrated models for both viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution including both internal X-ray and external far ultraviolet (FUV) photoevaporation for both evolution scenarios. We investigate both weak and strong FUV field environments, where the strong FUV field is calculated based on an environment similar to the Cygnus OB2 association. While both scenarios are able to reproduce observational constraints, our simulations suggest that different parameters are needed for the angular momentum transport to explain disc lifetimes and disc mass - stellar accretion rate relation in weakly and strongly irradiated regions. We find that the predicted median disc radii are much larger in low FUV environments compared to Cygnus OB2, but also decreasing with time. In the viscous scenario, the median disc radius in a low FUV field environment is ~100au larger than for the MHD wind-driven scenario. We further show that studying stellar accretion rates and externally driven wind mass-loss rates (provided that they can be isolated from internally driven winds; i.e. MHD wind) is indeed a promising way of disentangling the two evolution scenarios.",

The Fp-statistic is a frequentist method of detecting these CWs. In this paper, we study how the presence of pulsar red noise and a GWB affect the Fp-statistic. We compare results when marginalizing over the red noise and using the maximum-likelihood values of the red noise, and find little difference between the two. We also present results of using the Fp-statistic to analyze the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set, where we find no evidence for CWs in agreement with the previously published Bayesian results.",

We construct a learned latent space in which we perform further dimensionality reduction to find underlying structure in the data. Our results demonstrate that the sVAE model achieves high classification accuracy for FRB repeaters and reveals separation between repeater and non-repeater populations. Upon further analysis of the latent space, we observe that dispersion measure excess, spectral index, and spectral running are the dominant features distinguishing repeaters from non-repeaters.

Accurate assessment of systematic residuals in AGN astrometry is therefore crucial. In this talk, we analysed the parallaxes and proper motions of Gaia DR3 AGNs to characterize systematic errors and their correlations with various physical and observational properties. A subset of Gaia-CRF3 AGNs exhibits significant astrometric offsets, mainly arising from dual or lensed quasars whose structural variations induce photocenter jitter, mimicking parallax and proper motion. Such sources must be carefully excluded from reference frame construction. To this end, we introduce an astrometric quality index for each source to quantify its astrometric reliability. The results reveal a strong correlation between lower quality index values and increasing errors in position, proper motion, and parallax, demonstrating that the proposed index provides an effective metric for selecting high-fidelity AGNs as primary reference sources.",

Here we review the current state of the RV field, with particular attention paid to:   -The evolution of precise RV methodologies over the past two decades   -Modern RV spectrograph designs that can be calibrated to a stability level of better than 50 cm/s over timescales of years   -RV data reduction and post-processing techniques that minimize the impact of instrument systematics and stellar variability   -Techniques for detecting exoplanets in RV data and disentangling planetary signals from stellar variability",

        "title": "Effectiveness of High-Dimensional Distance Metrics on Solar Flare Time Series",
        "abstract": "Solar-flare forecasting has been extensively researched yet remains an open problem. In this paper, we investigate the contributions of elastic distance measures for detecting patterns in the solar-flare dataset, SWAN-SF. We employ a simple $k$-medoids clustering algorithm to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced, high-dimensional distance metrics. Our results show that, despite thorough optimization, none of the elastic distances outperform Euclidean distance by a significant margin. We demonstrate that, although elastic measures have shown promise for univariate time series, when applied to the multivariate time series of SWAN-SF, characterized by the high stochasticity of solar activity, they effectively collapse to Euclidean distance. We conduct thousands of experiments and present both quantitative and qualitative evidence supporting this finding.",

        "abstract": "The regain of interest in Moon exploration has substantially grown in the last years. For this reason, the space agencies consider the development of a precise navigation and positioning service similar to the Earth GNSS. Aiming at some meter accuracy, this requires to set up a relativistic lunar reference frame, with an associated coordinate time. If the IAU already defined the Lunar Coordinate Time TCL, there is still some freedom in the choice of the coordinate timescale to be adopted as reference on or around the Moon. This paper proposes a trade-off analysis of different possible options for this reference time scale. It shows that TCL is the best option to be used as practical time reference on the Moon, without the need to define a new time scale based on a scaling of TCL.",

In \\cite{1}, an energy-gap cost functional was formulated based on two auxiliary state problems, with existence of optimal solution attempted through continuity of state problems with respect to the domain. Nevertheless, there exists a corrigendum in Eq.(48) in \\cite{1}, where the boundedness of solution sequences for state problems with respect to the domain cannot be directly estimated via the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality as \\textbf{Claimed}. In this comment, we rectify this proof by Poincar\\'e-Friedrichs inequality.",

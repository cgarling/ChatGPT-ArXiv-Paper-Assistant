        "title": "EDGE-INFERNO: How chemical enrichment assumptions impact the individual stars of a simulated ultra-faint dwarf galaxy",
        "abstract": "The chemical abundances of stars in galaxies are a fossil record of the star formation and stellar evolution processes that regulate galaxy formation, including the stellar initial mass function, the fraction and timing of type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), and nucleosynthesis inside massive stars. In this paper, we systematically explore uncertainties associated with modeling chemical enrichment in dwarf galaxies. We repeatedly simulate a single EDGE-INFERNO dwarf ($M_{\\star} \\approx 10^5 \\, M_{\\odot}$), varying the chemical yields of massive stars, the timing and yields of SNeIa, and the intrinsic stochasticity that arises from sampling individual stars and galaxy formation chaoticity. All simulations are high-resolution (3.6 pc), cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations that track the stellar evolution of all individual stars with masses $>0.5\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. We find that variations in SNIa assumptions make the largest difference in mean abundance ratios and [Fe/H], highlighting the importance of detailed SNIa modeling even in such low-mass reionization-limited galaxies. In contrast, different massive star yields, accounting (or not) for stellar rotation, result in mean abundances comparable to those arising from stochasticity. Nonetheless, they significantly affect the shape of abundance trends with [Fe/H], for example, through the existence (or not) of a bimodality in the [X/Fe] - [Fe/H] planes, particularly in [Al/Fe]. Finally, we find that the variance arising from random sampling severely limits the interpretation of single galaxies. Our analysis showcases the power of star-by-star cosmological models to unpick how both systematic uncertainties (e.g., assumptions in low-metallicity chemical enrichment) and statistical uncertainties (e.g., averaging over enough galaxies and stars within a galaxy) affect the interpretation of chemical observables in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.",

        "abstract": "Observing the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in emission lines from ionized gas enables direct mapping of its spatial and kinematic structure, offering new insight into the gas flows that regulate galaxy evolution. Using the high-resolution Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE) simulations, we generate mock emission-line maps for six Milky Way-mass halos. Different ions (e.g., HI, OVI) trace distinct CGM phases and structures, highlighting the importance of observations in multiple species. We quantify the observable CGM mass fraction as a function of instrument spatial resolution and surface brightness sensitivity, finding that sensitivity is the dominant factor limiting detectability across all ions. At fixed sensitivity, higher spatial resolution reveals more structures; at fixed spatial resolution, higher sensitivity recovers a higher percentage of the total mass. We explore CGM kinematics by constructing emissivity-weighted projected velocity maps and comparing line-of-sight velocities between ions. OVI shows the largest kinematic deviation from HI, while MgII and SiII most closely follow HI velocities. Distinguishing these phases out to 50kpc from the galaxy center requires spectral resolution better than 30km/s for most ion pairs. Additionally, separating inflowing from outflowing gas based on projected kinematics also requires high spectral resolution: at 30km/s, more than 80% of gas above the emission detection threshold can be distinguished kinematically, but this fraction drops to <40% with a resolution of 200km/s. Our results provide predictions for future UV and optical instruments, showing that recovering the multiphase structure and kinematics of circumgalactic emission will require both high sensitivity and fine kinematic resolution.",

The surviving dwarf galaxies orbiting the MW serve as exceptional laboratories for studying the unique properties of these systems. Their metal-poor environments and shallow gravitational potentials likely drive significant differences in star formation and star cluster properties compared to those in the MW. Using high-quality near-infrared spectra from the APOGEE survey, we determined abundances of Fe, C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, and Ce for 74 stars in four MW satellite dwarf galaxies: Fornax, Sextans, Draco, and Carina.

These dwarf galaxies exhibit [Al/Fe$]\\sim -0.5$, which is comparable to those of the metal-poor stars in the MW. Additionally, we identified nitrogen-rich field stars in the Fornax dwarf galaxy, which display distinct metallicities compared to its known globular clusters (GCs). If these stars originated in GCs and subsequently escaped, their presence suggests we are observing relics of destroyed GCs, offering possible evidence of cluster disruption.",

We observe a displacement of the center of the satellite distribution, relative to the center of M31, of approximately 10--50 kpc towards the Milky Way. Nonetheless, the center of M31 remains compatible with the center of the dwarf galaxy distribution given the broad constraints on its position, with the significance of the shift ranging from $\\leq 1\\sigma$ to $1.9\\sigma$, depending on the assumed form of the volumetric spatial distribution of satellites. If M31 is truly offset from its satellite system, a quadrupling of the number of known satellites would be necessary to infer a significant ($3\\sigma$) offset.

PAH destruction in more intense ionizing environments and/or variations in the age of our sources may drive the deviation from a linear relation. In the metal-poor environment of NGC 4449 (${\\sim}$1/3 Z$_{\\odot}$), we see substantial deficits in the PAH feature strengths at fixed SFR and significantly higher scatter in the PAH-SFR relations. We determine that the 3.3/7.7 $\\mu$m PAH luminosity ratio increases towards lower metallicity environments. This is interpreted as a result of a shift in the size distribution towards smaller PAHs at lower metallicities, possibly due to inhibited grain growth. Focusing on the regions in NGC 4449, we observe a decreasing 3.3/7.7 $\\mu$m ratio towards higher SFR, which could indicate that small PAHs are preferentially destroyed relative to larger PAHs in significantly sub-solar metallicity conditions.

These ``wiggles'' are produced by buoyancy glitches -- sharp features in the buoyancy frequency ($N$) caused by composition transitions and the convective--radiative interface.   Our method takes the Fourier transform of the period-spacing series, $FT(\\Delta P_k)$ as a function of radial order $k$. We show that $FT(\\Delta P_k)$ traces the radial derivative of the normalized glitch profile $\\delta N/N$ with respect to the normalized buoyancy radius; peaks in $FT(\\Delta P_k)$ therefore pinpoint jump/drop locations in $N$ and measure their sharpness. We also note that the Fourier transform of relative period perturbations (deviations from asymptotic values), $FT(\\delta P/P)$, directly recovers the absolute value of the glitch profile $|\\delta N/N|$, enabling a straightforward inversion for the internal structure.   The dominant $FT(\\Delta P_k)$ frequency correlates tightly with central hydrogen abundance ($X_c$) and thus with stellar age for slowly pulsating B-stars, with only weak mass dependence. Applying the technique to MESA stellar models and to observed slowly pulsating B-stars and $\\gamma$ Dor pulsators, we find typical glitch amplitudes $\\delta N/N \\lesssim 0.01$ and derivative magnitudes $\\lesssim 0.1$, concentrated at chemical gradients and the convective boundary. This approach enables fast, ensemble asteroseismology of g-mode pulsators, constrains internal mixing and ages, and can be extended to other classes of pulsators, with potential links to tidal interactions in binaries.",

        "abstract": "Traditional cosmological hydrodynamical simulations usually assume equal-numbered but unequal-mass dark matter and baryonic particles, which can lead to spurious collisional heating due to energy equipartition. To avoid such a numerical heating effect, a simulation setup with equal-mass dark matter and baryonic particles, which corresponds to a particle number ratio of $N_{\\rm DM}:N_{\\rm gas} = \\Omega_{\\rm cdm} / \\Omega_{\\rm b}$, is preferred. However, previous studies have typically used grid-based particle loads to prepare such initial conditions, which can only reach specific values for $N_{\\rm DM}:N_{\\rm gas}$ due to symmetry requirements. In this study, we propose a method based on the glass approach that can generate two-component particle loads with more general $N_{\\rm DM}:N_{\\rm gas}$ ratios. The method simultaneously relaxes two Poisson particle distributions by introducing an additional repulsive force between particles of the same component. We show that the final particle load closely follows the expected minimal power spectrum, $P(k) \\propto k^{4}$, exhibits good homogeneity and isotropy properties, and remains sufficiently stable under gravitational interactions. Both the dark matter and gas components individually also exhibit uniform and isotropic distributions. We apply our method to two-component cosmological simulations and demonstrate that an equal-mass particle setup effectively mitigates the spurious collisional heating that arises in unequal-mass simulations. Our method can be extended to generate multi-component uniform and isotropic distributions. Our code based on Gadget-2 is available at https://github.com/liaoshong/gadget-2glass .",

        "abstract": "Aims. This paper introduces LRPayne, a novel algorithm designed for the efficient determination of stellar parameters and chemical abundances from low-resolution optical spectra, with a primary focus on data from large-scale galactic surveys such as WEAVE. Methods. LRPayne employs a model-driven approach, utilising a fully connected artificial neural network (ANN), trained on a library of 70,000 synthetic stellar spectra generated using iSpec with 1D MARCS model atmospheres and the Turbospectrum synthesis code. The network is trained to predict normalized flux given stellar labels (Teff, log(g), [Fe/H], vmic, vmax and v sin i, and 24 individual elemental abundances). Stellar parameters are subsequently derived from observed spectra by finding the best-fit synthetic spectrum from the ANN using a chi-squared minimisation technique. The method operates on spectra degraded to a resolution of R=5000 covering the wavelength range 4200-6900 {\\AA}. Results. Internal accuracy tests on synthetic spectra show a median interpolation error of less than 0.13 % for 90 % of the validation sample. The method accurately recovers most input labels from synthetic spectra, even at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 20, with some expected challenges for elements like Li, K, and N. Validation on observed spectra of 25 Gaia FGK benchmark stars and 42 metal-poor stars reveals good agreement with literature values. For stellar parameters, mean differences are 22+-87 K for Teff , 0.19+-0.23 dex for log(g), and 0.01+-0.17 dex for [Fe/H]. Abundances for elements like Na, Mg, Si, and most Fe-peak elements (Cr, Ni, V, Sc) are well-recovered. Challenges are noted for oxygen, manganese in metal-rich giants, aluminium in metal-poor stars and dwarfs, and for deriving log g in hot metal-poor dwarfs, partly due to non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects and line characteristics.",

        "abstract": "The progenitors of present-day galaxy clusters offer crucial insight into how galaxies and large-scale structure co-evolve in the early Universe. We present JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the photometrically identified $z=7.66$ protocluster core in the SMACS J0723.3-7327 lensing field, SMACS-PC-z7p7. Six [O III]-emitters and five additional photometric candidates are found within a 0.3 arcmin$^2$ ($1.5\\ {\\rm cMpc}^2$) region, corresponding to an overdensity of $\\delta \\sim 200$. Despite the extreme overdensity, the resident galaxies exhibit star-formation histories, UV-slopes and neutral hydrogen column densities that are consistent with those of field galaxies at similar redshifts. This is in stark contrast with the consistently high neutral hydrogen column densities, old stellar populations and large dust masses of galaxies within a $z=7.88$ protocluster in the Abell 2744 field. Comparison with the TNG-Cluster and TNG300 simulations indicates a halo mass of ${\\rm log_{10}}(M_{200{\\rm c}}[{\\rm M_{\\odot}}]) = 11.4\\pm0.2$, and implies that, on average, SMACS-PC-z7p7 will evolve into a present-day Fornax-like cluster (${\\rm log_{10}}(M_{200{\\rm c},\\ z=0}[{\\rm M_{\\odot}}]) = 13.7\\pm0.6$). The uniformly young, highly star-forming nature of the galaxy population of SMACS-PC-z7p7 suggests that environmental effects only become significant above halo masses of ${\\rm log_{10}}(M_{200{\\rm c}}[{\\rm M_{\\odot}}]) \\gtrsim 11.5$. Comparison to other $z\\gtrsim7$ protoclusters reveals that vigorous star formation persists in lower-mass protoclusters, whereas accelerated evolution and suppression of star formation emerge in more massive haloes. SMACS-PC-z7p7 therefore represents an early stage of protocluster assembly, where residence within an overdense environment still enhances star formation, and feedback processes have yet to exert a significant influence.",

        "abstract": "Star-forming galaxies form tight relations between their stellar mass, star-formation rate, and molecular gas reservoir on global and resolved scales. On the path to quiescence, the exchange between gas and stars must inevitably be broken. Understanding the mechanisms governing star formation and quenching therefore requires observations of both the stellar and molecular gas components. To this end, we have assembled a sample of 277 galaxies ($0.02 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 0.25$) with semi-resolved optical and millimetre $^{12}$CO(1-0) data, wherein the properties of the inner $\\thicksim$2 kpc can be distinguished from the outer regions. This effort was made possible by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogues and the maturing archive of the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimetre Array (ALMA). We call this dataset the SDSS-ALMA Legacy Value Archival Gas Exploration (SALVAGE). In this work, we leverage SALVAGE to provide a semi-resolved perspective on global scaling relations and why some galaxies deviate from them. In agreement with previous work, we find that the offset of a galaxy from the global star-forming main sequence (SFMS) is driven by its inner star formation rate. With the relative inner and outer distributions of molecular gas fraction and star formation efficiency, we investigate whether the central star formation driving global changes is due to fuel availability or efficiency. We find that the position of a galaxy within the SFMS is largely due to the inner star-formation efficiency, while departure from the SFMS is driven by availability of central gas. The central few kpc are thus the most consequential region for galaxy evolution at low redshift.",

        "abstract": "Context. While most chemical abundance studies of Cepheids rely on optical spectroscopy, near-infrared (NIR) observations offer advantages in terms of reduced extinction and access to new elemental tracers. Aims. We aim to validate NIR-based abundance determinations against optical results and to explore the diagnostic power of spectral lines inaccessible in the optical domain. The H and K bands allow us to trace elements such as P, K, and Yb, while also probing obscured Galactic regions and more distant Cepheids. Methods. We obtained high-resolution (R=45000) H- and K-band spectra for 21 Galactic and 2 LMC Classical Cepheids using IGRINS. Atmospheric parameters were derived from photometry and line-depth ratios (Teff), empirical calibrations (log g), and spectral fitting. Abundances of 16 elements were determined via LTE full spectral synthesis and compared with optical literature values. Results. We find excellent agreement between NIR and optical abundances, confirming the reliability of IGRINS-based measurements. The Fe, Mg, and Si gradients match previous optical determinations. We provide the first homogeneous NIR-based measurements of P, K, and Yb in Cepheids, consistent with chemical evolution models. The two LMC Cepheids in our sample, also studied optically, serve as extragalactic benchmarks for validating NIR abundances in low-metallicity regimes. Conclusions. High-resolution NIR spectroscopy yields accurate chemical abundances in Cepheids, consistent with optical results, and grants access to additional nucleosynthetic tracers. These results support future large NIR spectroscopic surveys with instruments such as MOONS, ELT, and JWST for Galactic and extragalactic archaeology.",

This is one way in which close pairs of galaxies show galactic conformity, which is thought to be driven by assembly bias. Such conformity is seen in ages, morphologies and star formation rates in different samples. This paper revisits a high signal-to-noise SDSS spectroscopic sample, by spectral fitting of new stellar population models, to investigate satellite galaxy properties of age, metallicity and alpha-element abundance. We find the clear signature of age conformity, as previously seen, but no clear evidence for conformity in metallicity or abundance ratios. The offsets showing age conformity are not caused by age-metallicity degeneracies. There is a suggestion in these data that lower velocity dispersion satellites have increased [alpha/Fe] compared to a control sample of passive galaxies, however this needs further observations to be verified. Our results also suggest an intriguing turnover in the age trends of the satellites at the highest velocity dispersion, perhaps reflecting the onset of environment-related processes in the most massive groups.",

        "abstract": "Radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs) eject a huge amount of energy into the surrounding medium and are thought to potentially prevent gas cooling and maintain the quiescence of massive galaxies. The short-lived, sporadic, and anisotropic nature of radio activities, coupled with the detection of abundant cold gas around some massive quiescent galaxies, raise questions about the efficiency of radio feedback in massive galaxies. Here we present an innovative method rooted in artificial intelligence to separate galaxies in which radio feedback is effective (RFE), regardless of current radio emission, from those in which radio feedback is ineffective (RFI), according to their optical images. Galaxies categorized as RFE are all dynamically hot, whereas quiescent RFI (RFI-Q) galaxies usually have extended cold-disk components. At given stellar mass, dark matter halos hosting RFE galaxies are between four to ten times more massive than those of RFI-Q galaxies. We find, for the first time, that almost all RFE galaxies have scant cold gas, irrespective of AGN activity. In contrast, many RFI-Q galaxies are surrounded by substantial amounts of condensed atomic gas, indicating a different evolutionary path from RFE galaxies. Our finding provides direct and compelling evidence that a radio AGN has gone through about 300 on-off cycles and that radio feedback can prevent gas cooling over a timescale much longer than that of radio activity. Contrary to general belief, our analysis shows that only a small fraction of massive galaxies are influenced by strong radio AGNs, suggesting that current galaxy formation models need serious revision.",

We identify ISM cloud structures in PHANGS-JWST 7.7 $\\mu$m PAH maps for 66 galaxies, smoothed to 30 pc and at native resolution, extracting 108,466 and 146,040 clouds, respectively. Molecular properties were inferred using a linear conversion from PAH to CO. Given the tendency for clouds in galaxy centers to overlap in velocity space, we opted to flag these and omit them from the analysis in this work. The remaining clouds correspond to giant molecular clouds, such as those detected in CO(2-1) emission by ALMA, or lower surface density clouds that either fall below the ALMA detection limits of existing maps or genuinely have no molecular counterpart. Cross-matching with ALMA CO maps at 90 pc in 27 galaxies shows that 41 % of PAH clouds have CO associations. The converted molecular properties vary little across environments, but the most massive clouds are preferentially found in spiral arms. Fitting lognormal mass distributions down to $2\\times10^{3} M_{\\odot}$ shows that spiral arms host the highest-mass clouds, consistent with enhanced formation in arm gravitational potentials. Cloud molecular surface densities decline by a factor of $\\sim 1.5-2$ toward $2 - 3 R_{e}$. However, the trend largely varies in individual galaxies, with flat, decreasing, and even no trend as a function of galactocentric radius. Factors like large-scale processes and morphologies might influence the observed trends. We publish two catalogs online, one at the common resolution of 30 pc and another at the native resolution.

In order to simulate the formation and evolution of such CSPs in star clusters, this work develops a code of direct N-body simulation of CSPs, NbodyCP. It is applied to different clusters, in particular, to binary clusters. It shows that CSPs and different kinds of cluster pairs can be formed via dynamical processes. This will help to partially explain the formation of CSPs and various clusters. Some special cluster structures, e.g., two cores or bar-like shape, are shown to be the results of evolution of some binary clusters. The simulation also shows that the separation between the members of a binary cluster affects the time of two member clusters to combine or move away significantly.",

H-ATLAS J084933.4+021443, a z = 2.41 binary HyLIRG (galaxies W and T) with two additional luminous companions (C and M), offers an ideal laboratory for studying star formation during \"cosmic noon\". We use ALMA to obtain resolved imaging and kinematics of CO J:7-6, [C I] 2-1, H2O, and rest-frame 340-1160 GHz continuum emission in all four galaxies. Each system is spatially resolved within ~0.3 arcsec (2.5 kpc) apertures. Gas kinematics in W and T are rotation-dominated, with galaxy T showing emission extended along its kinematic minor axis due to lensing magnification. Spatially resolved SEDs indicate that W is well fitted by single-temperature greybody dust despite hosting a luminous AGN, while T requires an additional hot-dust component and extra millimetre emission. We confirm [C I] J:2-1 as a tracer of warm/dense molecular gas in these extreme systems, though its luminosity ratio with CO J:7-6 rises sub-linearly. We derive resolved (2.5 kpc-scale) Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) relations for W and T using both cold and warm/dense gas, finding depletion times of about 50-100 Myr (W) and about 100-500 Myr (T). Both galaxies follow a steep SK relation with power-law index n ~ 1.7, significantly above the n ~ 1 observed in normal star-forming galaxies.",

        "abstract": "As part of the New-ANGELS program, we systematically investigate the X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of 4506 X-ray sources projected within a radius of 2.5 deg centering on M31. We construct XLFs for different regions in the disk and halo of M31, accounting for the incompleteness with an effective sensitivity map. Assuming that the halo regions contain (mostly) foreground stars and background active galactic nuclei, they are taken as \"background\" for deriving the XLFs of the sources in the disk. Through modeling XLFs, we decompose the X-ray sources into distinct populations for each region. We find that low-mass X-ray binaries are the dominant X-ray population throughout the disk of M31. The XLFs of M31 reveal a consistently lower integrated LMXB luminosity per stellar mass ($\\alpha_\\mathrm{LMXB}$) compared to other galaxies, likely due to M31's prolonged period of quiescent star formation. Variations in the XLF shape and $\\alpha_\\mathrm{LMXB}$ across different regions of M31 suggest that the relationship between integrated luminosity and stellar mass may vary within the galaxy. Additionally, the relatively low integrated luminosity observed in the inner-arm region provides crucial evidence for a rapid fading of M31's LMXBs around 1 Gyr, a finding consistent with recent observations of other nearby galaxies.",

        "abstract": "We seek to exploit the expanded observational range of the MeerKAT radio telescope with the new S-band receivers (2.0-2.8 GHz). To showcase its enhanced capabilities, we conducted new S-band observations of the galaxy NGC 2997 in full polarization. The S band is ideal for studying magnetic fields in spiral galaxies due to the weak Faraday depolarization. Performing a rotation measure (RM) synthesis allowed us to measure Faraday RMs in the galaxy, a signature of regular magnetic fields. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm was used to study the various azimuthal modes found in the RM data of the galaxy. The RM synthesis analysis indicates the direction of the magnetic field along the line of sight throughout the entire disk. Leveraging the sensitivity and high resolution provided by MeerKAT's S-band capability, this study achieves an unprecedented level of detail of the magnetic field structure. Our sector-based analysis of the RMs across azimuthal regions reveals the existence of modes of the large-scale magnetic field in NGC 2997. The variations in the RM values along the azimuthal angle reveal smoothly changing phase shifts between the rings, without the previously reported field reversal at about 3 kpc radius between the central region and disk. In this work, for the first time, a Fourier analysis has been applied to RM data averaged in sectors of rings in the disk plane of a spiral galaxy. Our Fourier analysis of the RM map shows three different large-scale field modes detected in the disk of NGC 2997. After applying a geometric modification, even multiples of the first mode were detected, as predicted from theoretical studies of dynamo action in a spiral galaxy with symmetric spiral structure. Our new method opens up new possibilities for investigating magnetic fields in spiral galaxies.",

        "abstract": "It remains debatable how billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) form and evolve within the first billion years. We report results from a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) survey of 27 luminous quasars at $z \\sim 5$-$6$, enabling a systematic investigation of their key physical properties and the associated, extended line emission. Our sample hosts SMBHs with $\\log(M_{\\mathrm{BH}}/M_\\odot) \\sim 8.6$-$9.7$ and Eddington ratios of $\\sim 0.1$-$2.6$ based on H$\\beta$, and the H$\\beta$-based and H$\\alpha$-based BH mass are broadly consistent with each other. Our sample may have a slightly smaller median BH mass and larger median Eddington ratio than lower-redshift quasars within the same luminosity range, although the difference could still be explained by statistical uncertainties. They generally follow the empirical correlations between [O III] $\\lambda$5007 equivalent width and bolometric luminosities or Eddington ratios formed by lower-redshift quasars. The majority of them fall within the Eigenvector~1 planes formed by lower-redshift quasars. Nevertheless, a subset of the sample shows enhanced, blueshifted [O III] emission associated with fast outflows. Spatially extended [O III] line emission is detected in 6 objects and shows morphologies and kinematics consistent with merging activities and/or turbulent and clumpy interstellar media (ISM). Tentative evidence of quasar radiative feedback shaping the ISM of a merging companion galaxy is seen in the object with the most extended [O III] emission.

        "abstract": "The complex task of unraveling the assembly history of the Milky Way is in constant evolution with new substructures identified continuously. To properly validate and characterise the family of galactic progenitors, it is important to take into account all the effects that can shape the distribution of tracers in the Galaxy. First among the often overlooked actors of galactic dynamics is the rotating bar of the Milky Way that can affect orbital tracers in multiple ways. We want to fully characterise the effect of the rotating bar of the Milky Way on the distribution of galactic tracers, provide diagnostics helpful in identifying its effect and explore the implications for the search and identification of substructures. We use the in-house Orbital Integration Tool (OrbIT), built to include the full effect of the bar and exploit its multidimensional output to perform a complete dynamical characterisation of a large sample of carefully selected Milky Way stars with very precise astrometry. We identify conspicuous overdensities in several orbital parameter spaces and verify that they are caused by the bar-induced resonances. We also show how contamination by trapped tracers provides local density enhancements that mimic the clumping usually attributed to genuine substructures. We provide a new and expedite way of identifying resonant loci and, consequently, to estimate the contribution of stars trapped into orbital resonances to phase-space overdensities previously identified as candidate relics of past merging events. Among those analysed here, we found that the detections of Cluster 3 and Shakti seem to have gained a non-negligible boost from resonance-trapped stars. Nyx is the most extreme case, with 70% of assigned member stars lying on resonant orbit, strongly suggesting that it is not the genuine relic of a merger event but an overdensity caused by bar-induced resonances",

Starting from a Debye-like modification of the surface degrees of freedom and employing the Unruh relation between acceleration and temperature, we obtain modified Einstein equations in which the geometric sector acquires explicit thermal corrections. Solving these equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime in the weak-field, low-temperature regime yields a corrected metric that smoothly approaches Minkowski space at large radii and naturally contains a characteristic acceleration scale. In the very-low-acceleration regime, the model reproduces MOND-like deviations from Newtonian dynamics while providing a relativistic underpinning for that phenomenology. We confront the theory with rotation-curve data for NGC~3198 and perform a Bayesian parameter inference, comparing our relativistic MOND (RMOND) model with both a baryons-only Newtonian model and a dark-matter halo model. We find that RMOND and the dark-matter model both fit the data significantly better than the baryons-only Newtonian prediction, and that RMOND provides particularly improved agreement at $r\\gtrsim 20\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$. These results suggest that temperature-corrected entropic gravity provides a viable relativistic framework for MOND phenomenology, motivating further observational tests, including gravitational lensing and extended galaxy samples.",

        "abstract": "The discovery of the large-scale structure has transformed our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Filaments of the cosmic web provide key environments that channel the growth of structures. Guided by predictions from cosmological simulations, we study the morphological distribution of galaxies in the Perseus-Pisces Supercluster, a prominent filamentary complex at 70 Mpc. We focus on how galaxy morphology and structural disturbances relate to position within the filament network and to proximity to dense nodes. Our sample is built from a spectroscopic catalogue cross-matched with deep r-band CFHT/MegaCam imaging from UNIONS and additional time, enabling the detection of low-surface-brightness features and extended outer structures. Morphologies are determined both visually and through structural parameters extracted from surface-brightness profiles using AutoProf and AstroPhot. The 3D filamentary skeleton of Perseus-Pisces is reconstructed with the DisPerSE algorithm, providing distances from each galaxy to the nearest filament and to group or cluster centres. The 3D mapping reveals a network of interconnected sub-filaments converging around the Pisces cluster, forming a complex, multi-branched structure that likely shapes environmental effects on galaxy evolution. We observe clear morphological and stellar-mass segregation: massive early-type galaxies (E/S0) concentrate along filament spines and near dense nodes, while late-type and irregular systems are more broadly dispersed. About 10-13% of galaxies show strong signs of gravitational interaction, with stellar-halo asymmetries particularly common in filaments and groups. These findings underline the dual influence of filamentary environments, which both host evolved early-type systems and foster local tidal interactions and pre-processing that modify galaxy morphology.",

        "abstract": "Protostellar jets provide valuable insight into the evolutionary stage and formation history of star-forming cores in their earliest phases. We investigated the inner envelope structures of three extremely young protostars, selected for having the shortest dynamical timescales in their outflows and jets. Our analysis is based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the N2D+, DCO+, DCN, C18O, CH3OH, and H2CO lines, along with 1.3 mm continuum data, obtained at two spatial resolutions of ~500 AU and 150 AU. By examining molecular depletion and sublimation patterns, emission extents at core-scale and outflow rotational temperatures, we assessed the relative evolutionary stages of the three sources. In G208.68-19.20N1, the absence of N2D+ toward the core-despite a semi-ring-like distribution-and the presence of bright DCN and DCO+ emission cospatial with C18O indicate a warmer envelope, possibly suggesting a more advanced evolutionary state. In contrast, G208.68-19.20N3 shows no dense central structures in C18O, DCN, DCO+, or N2D+, with emission instead appearing scattered around the continuum and along large-scale filaments, consistent with a likely younger stage than G208.68-19.20N1. The third source, G215.87-17.62M, exhibits compact C18O emission at the continuum peak, but spatially extended N2D+, DCN, and DCO+ along the continuum, pointing to a cooler envelope and likely the youngest stage among the three. This comparative analysis across three protostars demonstrates the effectiveness of molecular tracers for evolutionary staging, though variations in luminosity or accretion may also shape chemical morphologies. These results highlight the promise of broader surveys for advancing our understanding of early protostellar evolution.",

In this work, we perform a detailed investigation of the outflow--cloud interaction scenario for neutrino production in Seyfert nuclei. In this framework, fast AGN-driven winds collide with clumpy gas clouds in the nuclear region, forming bow shocks that efficiently accelerate cosmic-ray protons. The accelerated protons subsequently interact with cold protons from the outflows via inelastic proton--proton ($pp$) collisions, producing high-energy neutrinos, while the photomeson ($p\\gamma$) process with disk photons may provide a subdominant contribution at the highest energies. Applying this model to five neutrino-associated Seyfert galaxies, we successfully reproduce the observed TeV neutrino fluxes without violating existing gamma-ray constraints. By integrating over the Seyfert population using X-ray luminosity functions, we further demonstrate that Seyfert galaxies can account for a substantial fraction of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino background in the $10^4-10^5~{\\rm GeV}$ energy range.",

        "abstract": "The accurate positional measurement of Supernova (SN) 1987A is important for determining the kick velocity of its compact object and the velocities of the ejecta and various shock components. In this work, we perform absolute astrometry to determine the position of SN 1987A. We used multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope imaging to model the early ejecta and the equatorial ring (ER). We combined our measurements and obtained the celestial coordinates in the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by registering the observations onto Gaia Data Release 3. The final average position of the different measurements is ${\\alpha = 5^{\\mathrm{h}}~ 35^{\\rm{m}}~ 27^{\\rm{s}}.9884(30)}$, ${\\delta = -69^{\\circ}~ 16'~ 11''.1134(136)}$ (ICRS J2016). The early ejecta position is located 14 mas south and 16 mas east of the ER center, with the offset being significant at 96% confidence. The offset may be due to instrument and/or filter-dependent systematics and registration uncertainties, though an intrinsic explosion offset relative to the ER remains possible. Image registration with proper motion corrections yields similar astrometry and a source proper motion of ${\\mu_{\\rm east} (\\equiv \\rm{PM_{\\alpha }*}) = 1.60 \\pm 0.15 ~\\rm{mas ~ yr^{-1}}}$ and ${\\mu_{\\rm{north}} (\\equiv \\rm{PM_{\\delta}}) = 0.44 \\pm 0.09~\\rm{mas ~ yr^{-1}}}$, in agreement with the typical local motion of the Large Magellanic Cloud. The absolute positional uncertainty of 21 mas adds a systematic uncertainty to the sky-plane kick velocity of ${123}~(t/40~\\rm{yr})^{-1}~\\rm{km~s}^{-1}$, where $t$ is the time since the explosion. Comparing the location of the compact source observed with JWST to our updated position implies a sky-plane kick of ${399\\pm148~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ and a 3D kick of ${472\\pm126~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$, which is consistent with previous estimates.",

Considering the standard MB prescription, the initial orbital periods of LMXBs that can evolve into binary millisecond pulsar (MSP) with He white dwarfs (WDs) and short orbital periods ($2-9~\\rm hours$) are within an extremely narrow interval, which was named the fine-tuning problem. Employing the detailed binary evolution model, we investigate the evolution of LMXBs in both the standard and convection and rotation boosted (CARB) MB laws. In the standard MB case, it is difficult for donor stars to form a He core and exhaust H envelope through mass transfer at short orbital periods, making them semidetached systems. The CARB MB mechanism can drive LMXBs evolve toward compact detached MSP-WD systems in wide initial orbital periods, over which binary MSPs with long orbital periods will be produced. We obtain the initial parameter space of binary MSPs with He WDs in the initial orbital period and donor-star mass plane, which can be applied to future statistics study by population synthesis simulations. We also discuss a new relation between orbital period and WD mass, formation of persistent ultra-compact X-ray binaries with relatively long orbital periods, and detectability of compact MSP-WD systems as low-frequency gravitational wave sources.",

Among 164 pulsars with independent distance measurements and 3530 open clusters, we find that 4 pulsars are likely residing in open clusters. In particular, we find compelling evidence that the binary pulsar J1302$-$6350 (B1259$-$63) is a member of the open cluster UBC~525; based on Gaia data, we update its distance to be $2.26\\pm 0.07$~kpc and measure the mass of its companion Be star LS 2883 to be $16.8 M_\\odot$. For 145 pulsars with both distance and proper motion measurements and 2967 open clusters with full kinematic parameters, we trace the past trajectories of both pulsars and open clusters in the Galactic gravitational potential, and find pulsars that were within 3 times the radius of a cluster. This results in 19 pulsars that were likely born in open clusters. We discuss implications for the formation history of PSR J1302$-$6350 and highlight the scientific potential of searching for pulsars in open clusters.",

The framework simulates a strong lensing cluster from the CosmoDC2 catalog, calculating the gravitational potential and performing ray-tracing to derive the true positions, shapes and light distribution of galaxies within the cluster field. Additionally, the simulation incorporates intra-cluster light (ICL) and spectral energy distributions (SEDs), enabling further strong lensing analyses, such as ICL seperation from galaxy light and mass reconstruction combining strong and weak lensing measurements.

We find that they could form through stellar mergers, binary black hole mergers, and mixed mergers. The mass distribution of these candidate progenitors covers the component masses of GW231123. Under our model assumptions, their predicted merger rate density spans the range of $0.001-0.26{\\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$, encompassing that of GW231123.

This delivers a potential standard ruler, independent of baryon acoustic oscillations and therefore able to break parameter degeneracies and improve precision. Furthermore, the turnover scale is independent of redshift and clustering bias, allowing for stacking of the signals from redshift bins. In practice, the very large scale of the turnover means that sample variance and systematics are serious impediments to its detection. Detections of the turnover and measurements of its scale have been made in the WiggleZ, eBOSS, Quaia, and DESI surveys. Upcoming surveys should improve the detection significance and reduce errors on the turnover scale. We use MCMC forecasts for turnover detection in a spectroscopic Euclid-like survey and a futuristic MegaMapper-like survey. In addition to the power spectrum, we include the signal from the bispectrum in equilateral configurations.

This limitation arises in many physics problems, such as Mixture Models (MM) with an unknown number of components or the inference of overlapping signals in noisy data, as in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) Global Fit problem. Traditional approaches, such as product-space methods or Reversible-Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC), often face efficiency and convergence limitations. This paper presents samsara, a Continuous-Time Markov Chain Monte Carlo (CTMCMC) framework that models parameter evolution through Poisson-driven birth, death, and mutation processes. samsara is designed to sample models of unknown dimensionality. By requiring detailed balance through adaptive rate definitions, CTMCMC achieves automatic acceptance of trans-dimensional moves and high sampling efficiency. The code features waiting time weighted estimators, optimized memory storage, and a modular design for easy customization. We validate samsara on three benchmark problems: an analytic trans-dimensional distribution, joint inference of sine waves and Lorentzians in time series, and a Gaussian MM with an unknown number of components. In all cases, the code shows excellent agreement with analytical and Nested Sampling results. All these features push samsara as a powerful alternative to RJMCMC for large- and variable-dimensional Bayesian inference problems.",

Their origin and power source remain uncertain. To help address this uncertainty, here we use a template-free reconstruction of ten years of all-sky Fermi/LAT data provided by Platz et al. (2023) to carry out a pixel-by-pixel spectral analysis of the Bubbles. We recover the position-dependent spectral shape and normalization that would be required for parent proton or electron cosmic ray populations to produce the Bubbles' observed gamma-ray spectra. We find that models in which the gamma-ray emission is driven by either hadronic or leptonic processes can explain the data equally well. The cosmic ray population driving the emission must have either broken power-law or exponentially cut-off spectra, with break or cutoff energies that are almost constant with latitude but spectral indices below the break that harden towards the Bubbles' southern tip. For the leptonic channel, reproducing the observed position-dependent gamma-ray spectrum also requires a cosmic ray electron energy density that grows with distance from the Galactic plane and increases towards the edges of the Bubbles. This finding disfavors scenarios for the origin of the Bubbles where a population of cosmic ray electrons is accelerated near the Milky Way center and subsequently advected out to the extremities of the Bubbles.",

We explore extensions of these non-Riemannian approaches, aiming to replicate the observed late-time acceleration of the universe by emulating the cosmological constant's role. We also evaluate the consistency of these theories with local gravity constraints by studying their static, spherically symmetric solutions. We show that although some models can reproduce the desired cosmological behavior, they often fail to meet Solar System observational bounds, particularly through deviations in the predicted Eddington parameter.

        "abstract": "The mass distribution of neutron stars encodes information about their formation and binary evolution. We compare the masses of two distinct populations: I) the recently identified Gaia neutron stars in wide orbits with solar-like companions and, II) the assumed first-born recycled pulsar in Galactic double neutron star systems. Naively, one would expect their masses to differ due to both the presumed differences in their evolutionary histories, as well as astrophysical selection effects that can filter out configurations that would merge or be disrupted. Yet, we find that their mass distributions are strikingly similar. Using a two-component Gaussian model, we find that both populations exhibit a narrow component centred near $1.3 \\text{ M}_\\odot$, accompanied by a broader, higher-mass component that extends the distribution toward larger masses. The highest density regions of their fitted parameter posteriors coincide by over 91.6%. Statistical tests further confirm the agreement between these distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence $JS < 0.08$ and an earth mover's distance of $W <0.063 \\text{ M}_\\odot$ at 90% credibility. This finding seems to imply that both mass functions reflect the natal mass distribution of first-born neutron stars in binary systems, supporting the hypothesis that neutron stars can be born with high masses. Consequently and perhaps surprisingly, binary evolutionary processes need not impart features on the NS mass distribution.",

        "abstract": "Although mass transfer (MT) has been studied primarily in circular binaries, observations show that it also occurs in eccentric systems. We investigate orbital evolution during non-conservative MT in eccentric orbits, a process especially relevant for binaries containing compact objects (COs). We examine four angular momentum loss (AML) modes; Jeans, isotropic re-emission, orbital-AML and $L_2$ mass loss -- the latter is the most efficient AML mode. For fixed AML mode and accretion efficiency, orbital evolution is correlated: orbits either widen while becoming more eccentric, or shrink while circularizing. Jeans mode generally yields orbital widening and eccentricity pumping, whereas $L_2$ mass loss typically leads to orbital shrinkage and eccentricity damping. Isotropic re-emission and orbital-AML show intermediate behavior. Adopting isotropic re-emission, we demonstrate that eccentric MT produces compact binaries that merge via gravitational waves (GW) within a Hubble time, whereas the same systems would instead merge during MT under traditional modeling. We further show that, in eccentric orbits, the gravitational potential at $L_2$ becomes lower than at $L_1$ across large range of mass ratios and eccentricities, naturally linking eccentricity to $L_2$ mass loss. Since interacting binaries containing COs are frequently eccentric, $L_2$ mass loss offers a new robust pathway to orbital tightening during eccentric MT, contributing to the formation rate of GW sources. This model can treat orbital evolution due to conservative and non-conservative MT in arbitrary eccentricities with applications ranging from MT on the main sequence to GW progenitors.",

        "abstract": "The formation channels of magnetars remain an open question. Although core collapse supernovae of isolated massive stars are important, binary interactions -- such as tidal interaction, common envelope evolution, and stellar mergers -- may also play a significant role in making magnetars. Understanding the relative contributions of these channels is crucial for linking magnetars to their observed properties and host environments. In this paper, we investigate potential magnetar formation channels using population synthesis simulations, considering both single-star and isolated binary system evolution. By conducting simulations with different parameters, we compare the effects of various evolution processes on magnetar formation. Additionally, we study the delay times and kick velocities across all formation channels, analyze the orbital properties and companion types of surviving magnetar binaries. We find that the majority of magnetars are observed as single objects ($\\geq 90\\%$), although a large fraction of them were originally in binary systems and experienced either kick disruption or merger. Surviving binaries are most likely to host main-sequence companions and exhibit different distributions of eccentricities due to different supernova mechanisms. These findings show the critical role of binary evolution in magnetar formation and provide predictions for the properties of magnetar populations that can be tested with future observations.",

The data are then accounted for in a physically motivated, spatially-dependent propagation model.

Most constraints on dark energy arise from background observables -- supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background -- which mainly test the homogeneous expansion history. To move beyond this limitation, we examine how kinetic Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (kSZ) tomography, combined with galaxy clustering, can probe perturbative effects of dark energy and improve constraints on its background parameters. Using a Fisher-matrix analysis of the joint power spectra for LSST- and CMB-S4-like surveys, we quantify the additional information kSZ tomography contributes to dark-energy inference. Including kSZ data tightens constraints on $w_0$ by 15 % and on $w_a$ by 32 %, with parameter degeneracies distinct from those of geometric probes. We also assess the detectability of dark-energy perturbations through a two-parameter model, finding that for canonical sound speed ($c_s=1$) the effects are sub-percent and confined to horizon scales, while smaller sound speeds shift them to accessible $k$-ranges. Near-term kSZ measurements will primarily serve to test the consistency between background and perturbative signals, while future low-noise, high-resolution surveys may begin to uncover the microphysical properties of dark energy.",

        "abstract": "Gravitational waves (GWs) can be distorted by intervening mass distributions while propagating, leading to frequency-dependent modulations that imprint a distinct signature on the observed waveforms. Bayesian inference for GW lensing with conventional sampling methods is costly, and the problem is exacerbated by the rapidly growing GW catalog. Moreover, assessing the statistical significance of lensed candidates requires thousands, if not millions, of simulations to estimate the background from noise fluctuations and waveform systematics, which is infeasible with standard samplers. We present a novel method, \\texttt{DINGO-lensing}, for performing inference on lensed GWs, extending the neural posterior estimation framework \\texttt{DINGO}. By comparing our results with those using conventional samplers, we show that the compute time of parameter estimation of lensed GWs can be reduced from weeks to seconds, while preserving accuracy both in the posterior distributions and the evidence ratios. We train our neural networks with LIGO detector noise at design sensitivity and a lens model that accommodates two overlapping chirps with opposite parity. We show that the lensing parameters are recovered with millisecond precision for the time delays. We also demonstrate that our network can identify signals diffracted by point masses, highlighting its flexibility for searches. By simulating thousands of lensed and nonlensed events, we determine how the detectability changes with different source properties. \\texttt{DINGO-lensing} provides a scalable and efficient avenue for identifying and characterizing gravitationally lensed GW events in the upcoming observing runs.",

        "abstract": "Pulsar searching with next-generation radio telescopes requires efficiently sifting through millions of candidates generated by search pipelines to identify the most promising ones. This challenge has motivated the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based tools. In this work, we explore an optimized pulsar search pipeline that utilizes deep learning to sift ``snapshot'' candidates generated by folding de-dispersed time series data. This approach significantly accelerates the search process by reducing the time spent on the folding step. We also developed a script to generate simulated pulsars for benchmarking and model fine-tuning. The benchmark analysis used the NGC 5904 globular cluster data and simulated pulsar data, showing that our pipeline reduces candidate folding time by a factor of $\\sim$10 and achieves 100% recall by recovering all known detectable pulsars in the restricted parameter space. We also tested the speed-up using data of known pulsars from a single observation in the Southern-sky MWA Rapid Two-metre (SMART) survey, achieving a conservatively estimated speed-up factor of 60 in the folding step over a large parameter space. We tested the model's ability to classify pulsar candidates using real data collected from the FAST, GBT, MWA, Arecibo, and Parkes, demonstrating that our method can be generalized to different telescopes. The results show that the optimized pipeline identifies pulsars with an accuracy of 0.983 and a recall of 0.9844 on the real dataset.

        "abstract": "We show that the stochastic background of gravitational wave memory of growing type leads to a fractional Brownian motion increasing at the order of $t^{H}$ for large $t$ where $\\frac{1}{2} < H <1$. This beats the scaling law of Brownian motion. In this article we investigate sources of gravitational waves in the early universe as well as in astrophysical settings. Cosmological sources may include primordial black holes or other sources immediately after the Big Bang when there were pockets of hot material, and large density fluctuations. Gravitational waves from mergers of primordial black holes produce memory. We show that due to the conditions in which these are taking place the gravitational wave memory will be increasing in time following a certain power law. Corresponding results hold for any gravitational wave memory from a cosmological source where the surrounding conditions are similar. The stochastic limit of these memories is a stochastic process growing in time faster than the $\\sqrt{t}$ scaling law of Brownian motion. The latter is also typical for noise and for the limit of memory events as they have been mostly considered in the literature. In an expanding universe, the memory is enhanced by the expansion itself. Our results provide a tool to extract gravitational wave sources of this type from data using this memory signature. This would be particularly useful for the PTA data that has been already observed, answering the long-standing question on how to extract memory signals from the data. Further, the new results open up a new door to explore the conditions right after the Big Bang using the long-range dependence and further probability analysis.",

We investigated the V1371 Tau system using TESS photometry, multi-epoch spectroscopy, and recent interferometric data, confirming it as a rare triple system consisting of an eclipsing binary orbited by a classical Be star, with a spectral classification of (B1V + B0V) + B0Ve. The eclipsing binary exhibits an orbital period of approximately 34 days, and the Be star orbits the inner pair on a timescale of a few years. Weak H$\\alpha$ emission lines suggest the presence of a Keplerian disk with variability on a timescale of months around the Be star, and a nearly constant V/R ratio with no detectable asymmetry variations. Besides the eclipses, frequencies at 0.24 and 0.26 c/d dominate the photometric variability. Higher-frequency signals are present which appear associated with non-radial pulsation. The eclipsing pair ($i \\approx 90^\\circ$) shows projected rotational velocities of 160 and 200 km s$^{-1}$. The Be star's measured $v \\sin i \\approx 250$ km s$^{-1}$ implies a critical rotation fraction between 0.44 and 0.76 for plausible inclinations, significantly faster than the eclipsing components. The shallower eclipses in the KELT data compared to TESS suggest a variation in orbital inclination, possibly induced by Kozai-Lidov cycles from the outer Be star. The evolution analysis suggests that all components are massive main-sequence stars, with the secondary star in the eclipsing binary being overluminous. This study emphasizes the complexity of triple systems with Be stars and provides a basis for future research on their formation, evolution, and dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Pulse profile modelling is a relativistic ray-tracing technique that has provided constraints on parameters, with a focus on mass and radius, of five rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. While the technique can also be applied to accretion-powered millisecond pulsars (AMPs), this requires accounting for the X-rays from the accretion disc and has only been applied to archival data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Here, we apply a previously developed neutron star and accretion disc model to the NICER (Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer) data of the 2019 and 2022 outbursts of SAX J1808.4-3658. We find that a single circular hotspot model is insufficient to explain the data. Modelling with two hotspots and an accretion disc model provides better phase-residuals, but a spectral residual at around 1 keV remains. In contrast, we find a good fit with a flexible background approach, replacing the accretion disk. However, the inferred parameters are not robust due to a degeneracy in the origin of the non-pulsed radiation, which can be caused either by the background or a hotspot that is at least partially in view throughout a full rotation. This work represents an important next step in pulse profile modelling of AMPs by analysing NICER data and underlines the need for more accurate accretion disc and hotspot modelling to achieve robust parameter constraints. We expect the inclusion of higher energy and polarimetric data will provide complementary constraints on inclination, hotspot colatitude, and hotspot size, improving the accuracy of pulse profile modelling of AMPs.",

        "abstract": "AstroPix is a high-voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) monolithic active pixel sensor originally developed to enable precision gamma-ray imaging and spectroscopy in the medium-energy regime (approximately 100 keV-100 MeV) based on the groundwork laid by ATLASpix and MuPix. It features a 500 um pixel pitch, in-pixel amplification and digitization, and low power consumption (around 3-4 mW/cm^2), making it scalable for large-area, multilayer telescope detector planes. The detectors have a designed dynamic range of 25 keV to 700 keV.   With these features, AstroPix meets the requirements of future space-based high-energy telescopes and the imaging layers of the Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) in the Electron-Proton/Ion Collider (ePIC) detector at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). For the space-based payload, AstroPix is being integrated into sounding rocket and balloon payloads to demonstrate the technical readiness of the devices. For BIC, AstroPix-based imaging layers interleaved within the lead/scintillating-fiber (Pb/SciFi) sampling calorimeter provide granular shower imaging, enabling key performance features such as electron/pion or gamma/neutral-pion separation.   As part of the ongoing detector R&D efforts, we have been testing various AstroPix v3 configurations: the single chip, a quad-chip assembly, a three-layer stack of quad chips, and a nine-chip module that represents the smallest prototype unit of the BIC imaging layer. This presentation will highlight recent performance test results from these AstroPix detector configurations.",

        "abstract": "The China Space Station Telescope (CSST), slated to become China's largest space-based optical telescope in the coming decade, is designed to conduct wide-field sky surveys with high spatial resolution. Among its key observational modes, slitless spectral observation allows simultaneous imaging and spectral data acquisition over a wide field of view, offering significant advantages for astrophysical studies. Currently, the CSST is in the development phase and lacks real observational data. As a result, the development of its data processing pipeline and scientific pre-research must rely on the mock data generated through simulations. This work focuses on developing a simulation framework for the CSST slitless spectral imaging system, analyzing its spectral dispersing properties and structural design. Additionally, the detection performance of the slitless spectral system is assessed for various astrophysical targets. Simulation results demonstrate that nearly all 1st order spectra are accompanied by corresponding 0th order images, facilitating accurate source identification. Furthermore, the GI spectral band exhibits superior detection efficiency compared to the GV and GU bands, establishing it as the primary observational band for stellar and galactic studies. This work successfully develops a simulation framework for the CSST slitless spectroscopic equipment.",

        "abstract": "Determining whether black hole jets are dominated by leptonic or baryonic matter remains an open question in high-energy astrophysics. We propose that extreme mass ratio binary (EMRB) black holes, where an intermediate mass secondary black hole (a \"miniquasar\") periodically interacts with the accretion flow of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), offer a natural laboratory to probe jet composition. In an EMRB, the miniquasar jet is launched episodically after each disk-crossing event, triggered by the onset of super-Eddington accretion. The resulting emissions exhibit temporal evolution as the jet interacts with the SMBH accretion disk. Depending on whether the jet is leptonic or hadronic in composition, the radiative signatures differ substantially. Notably, a baryonic jet produces a more pronounced gamma-ray output than a purely leptonic jet. By modeling the evolution of the multifrequency characteristic features, it is suggested that the gamma-ray-to-UV emissions may serve as a diagnostic tool capable of distinguishing between leptonic and baryonic scenarios. The resulting electromagnetic signals, when combined with multi-messenger observations, offer a powerful means to constrain the physical nature of relativistic jets from black holes.",

While theoretical models of shadows in vacuum are mature, real astrophysical black holes like M87* and Sgr A* are enveloped in plasma, which can alter photon trajectories through dispersion. Current understanding, based on foundational work, indicates that only specific plasma distributions allow for an analytical treatment via the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we build upon this framework to systematically investigate the propagation of light rays in Kerr spacetime surrounded by a pressureless, non-magnetized cold plasma. We explicitly derive the separability condition, identifying the exact class of plasma densities that permit a generalized Carter constant. For these models, we compute the photon regions and shadow boundaries, characterizing how the shadow's size and shape deviate from the vacuum case in a frequency-dependent manner. Our results provide analytical benchmarks for the distortion of shadows in dispersive media and determine the critical plasma frequency beyond which the shadow is erased, offering a direct link between observable shadow features and the properties of the ambient plasma environment and providing a foundation for studying more dynamic, non-separable plasma distributions.",

In this model, a GUT Higgs field both drives inflation and induces intermediate-scale symmetry breaking, thereby linking primordial cosmology, gauge unification, and topological defect formation. A partial inflationary phase of $N_I \\sim 10$--$17$ $e$-folds following monopole formation can dilute magnetic monopoles to abundances $Y_M \\sim 10^{-35}$--$10^{-27}$.

Composition analyses at IceCube highly benefit from its multi-detector design. Combining the measurement of the electromagnetic shower component and low-energy muons at the surface with the response of the in-ice array to the associated high-energy muons improves the directional reconstruction accuracy and opens unique possibilities to extract the primary particle's mass. In this contribution, a new methodical approach for the analysis of these low-energy air showers is presented, including techniques for the identification of coincident background in the in-ice detector and a machine learning model based on convolutional neural networks to determine the elemental composition.

        "abstract": "Since the launch of JWST, observations of exoplanetary atmospheres have seen a revolution in data quality. Given that atmospheric parameter inferences depend heavily on the underlying data, a re-evaluation of current methodologies is warranted to assess the reliability of these results. We investigate the impact of variations in input spectra on atmospheric retrievals for the hot Jupiter WASP-39 b using JWST transit data. Specifically, we analyse the reliability of parameter estimations from random perturbations of the underlying spectrum and their sensitivity to three transmission spectra derived from the same observational data. Using the NIRSpec PRISM observation from a single transit of WASP-39 b, we perform retrievals with the TauREx framework. As a baseline, we use a spectrum derived with the Eureka! data reduction pipeline. To evaluate retrieval reliability, we analyse posterior distributions under deviations from this spectrum. We simulate random noise by performing retrievals on scattered instances of this spectrum and compare them with retrievals based on existing spectra reduced from the same raw observation. Our analysis identifies three types of posterior distributions: (1) Stable, Gaussian distributions for species constrained across the entire spectrum (e.g., H2O, CO2); (2) Uniform posteriors with upper bounds for weakly constrained species (e.g., CO, CH4); and (3) Unstable, heavy-tailed posteriors for species constrained by minor spectrum features (e.g., SO2, C2H2). We find that other parameters, such as the planetary radius and p-T profile, are stable under spectral perturbations. Posterior distributions differ for retrievals on independently reduced transmission spectra from the same raw data, complicating interpretation, particularly for skewed distributions. Based on this, we advocate for careful assessment and selection of credible interval sizes to reflect this.",

The analysis integrates the definition of the mission profile, the instrumental concept architecture, and an error budget that breaks down the key contributors to the sub-micro arcses precision required for a single measurement. A portion of this budget addresses photo-center estimation for both the target and calibration stars used in differential astrometry. Other major contributors are related to instrumental control of systematics in the reconstruction of differential angle measurements from pixel data (focal plane calibration) to on sky line of sight (telescope distortion calibration). End-of-mission astrometry requires multiple observations (typically 100) of the same target distributed over the mission lifetime. We assess the mission profile to estimate the fraction of survey time required for astrometric survey to achieve the science objective. The proposed architecture of the instrument concept is derived from error budget and mission constraints based on a large visible detector array composed of an assembly of multiple CMOS sensor chips resulting in an overall gigapixel focal plane. We evaluate the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and propose a way forward reaching TRL 5 level for key technologies by the Mission Consolidation Review in 2029.",

        "abstract": "In our previous work, we applied the ICCF-Cut method to the continuum reverberation mapping (CRM) of six active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on the published Swift data. Extending this work, we perform a systematic AGN CRM study utilizing the Swift archive. We enlarge our sample with eight additional AGNs at $z<0.05$ with high-cadence ($<3$ days) and multiband photometric observations. Time series analysis of these light curves shows two main results: (1) The interband lags are broadly consistent with $\\tau \\propto \\lambda^{4/3}$, while the average interband lags are larger than those predicted by the standard thin accretion disk model. (2) For most targets, there exists a $U$ band lag excess, which is probably due to the diffuse continuum emission from the broad-line region (BLR). We employ the ICCF-Cut method to extract the possible diffuse continuum component from the $U$ band light curves and calculate the diffuse continuum lags ($\\tau_{\\rm cut}$), which are generally consistent with the lags ($\\tau_{\\rm jav}$) derived by the JAVELIN Photometric Reverberation Mapping Model. Further analysis with our sample indicates a positive correlation between the diffuse continuum region size and the BLR size ($R_{\\rm DCR}-R_{\\rm BLR}$ relation), as well as another correlation with the luminosity ($R_{\\rm DCR}-L$ relation). These findings provide further evidence for a significant contribution of diffuse continuum emission from the BLR to the AGN continuum lags.",

        "abstract": "The magnetorotational instability (MRI) plays a crucial role in the evolution of many types of accretion disks. It is often studied using ideal-MHD numerical simulations. In principle, such simulations should be numerically converged, i.e. their properties should not change with resolution. Convergence is often assessed via the MRI quality factor, $Q$, the ratio of the Alfv\\'en length to the grid-cell size. If it is above a certain threshold, the simulation is deemed numerically converged. In this paper we argue that the quality factor is not a good indicator of numerical convergence. First, we test the performance of the quality factor on simulations known to be unconverged, i.e. local ideal-MHD simulations with zero net-flux, and show that their $Q$s are well over the typical convergence threshold. The quality-factor test thus fails in these cases. Second, we take issue with the linear theory underpinning the use of $Q$, which posits a constant vertical field. This is a poor approximation in real nonlinear simulations, where the vertical field can vary rapidly in space and generically exhibits zeros. We calculate the linear MRI modes in such cases and show that the MRI can reach near-maximal growth rates at arbitrarily small scales. Yet, the quality factor assumes a single and well-defined scale, near the Alfv\\'en length, below which the MRI cannot grow. We discuss other criticisms and suggest a modified quality factor that addresses some, though not all, of these issues.",

With the recent sixth data release (DR6), the scalar spectral index was measured to be $n_s=0.9743 \\pm 0.0034$, which appears to exclude the pure Starobinsky model at approximately the $2\\sigma$ level. In this paper, we implement the Starobinsky inflationary potential directly into the CLASS code, without relying on the slow-roll approximation, and we constrain the number of e-folds of inflation $N_k$ using a theoretically motivated range derived from reheating considerations and standard couplings between matter fields and gravity. We show that it is still possible to identify a significant region of parameter space where the Starobinsky model remains highly consistent with the latest observational data. While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how including a cubic $R^3$ term can shift its predictions to better align with the Planck and ACT measurements.",

The telescope offered an ideal vantage view of the Southern Sky and benefited from optimal water properties for enhanced angular resolution. This study makes use of data collected over the entire operational period of ANTARES to search for sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos, considering both steady and flaring emission scenarios. First, a time-integrated search for high-energy neutrino clustering across the celestial sphere is conducted. The most significant accumulation is found at coordinates $(\\alpha, \\delta) =(200.5^\\circ\\, 17.7^\\circ)$ with a post-trial p-value equal to 0.38. A dedicated search in the Galactic Plane is also performed for extended sources, yielding no significant excess. Additionally, a list of potential neutrino sources are investigated. The blazar MG3 J225517+2409 is identified as the most significant object, yet the excess remains compatible with background fluctuations. A mild local excess of 2.4$\\sigma$ is found for the blazar TXS 0506+056. The full sky is also examined for the presence of flaring neutrino emissions. The most significant excess in this case corresponds to a $\\sim$4-day flare from the direction $(\\alpha, \\delta) = (141.3^\\circ\\, 9.8^\\circ)$, with a post-trial p-value of 0.30. Finally, the directions of sources highlighted in IceCube's time-dependent searches are investigated. Temporal overlaps between ANTARES and IceCube flares are identified for PKS 1502+106 and TXS 0506+056, with an estimated chance probability of about 0.02%, making this observation particularly noteworthy.",

In this study, we employ global numerical simulations to investigate the excitation mechanisms and dynamical consequences of inertial modes in the Sun and stellar interiors. We validate first our numerical setup by analyzing the evolution of sectoral and tesseral perturbations imposed on a rigidly rotating sphere. The results confirm that a perturbation of a given mode can excite neighboring modes with both smaller and larger wavenumbers along the dispersion relation of Rossby waves. Subsequently, we use a physically motivated forcing to impose differential rotation with varying shear amplitudes, and examine the spontaneous onset and nonlinear evolution of inertial modes. The simulations reveal that the growth of velocity perturbations is primarily driven by baroclinic instability. It gives rise to high-latitude inertial modes in the form of retrograde polar vortices whose properties depend on the imposed shear. Equatorial Rossby modes are also excited, albeit with lower intensity than their high-latitude counterpart. Perturbations with arbitrary azimuthal wavenumbers lead to the excitation of Rossby modes for all available wave numbers, sustained by both direct and inverse energy cascades. In simulations with stronger shear, the high latitude modes produce Reynolds stresses able to modify the imposed differential rotation and accelerate the rotation of the poles.",

        "abstract": "The Sino-French SVOM (Space Variable Objects Monitor) mission is a space-based astronomy mission complemented with ground-based dedicated instrumentation. It aims to explore and study high-energy cosmic phenomena, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This unprecedented combination of space-based and ground-based instruments will provide leading multi-wavelength observational capabilities in gamma-rays, X-rays, optical, and near-infrared bands. The complete observation sequence of each GRB triggered by the SVOM mission consists of three stages, the GRB detections, followed by the on-board and grounded automatic follow-ups, and rapid deep multi-band photometry and spectroscopy re-visit observations. To efficiently organize all grounded instruments performing automatic follow-ups and re-visit observations, we develop a follow-up observation coordinating service (FOCS), which is capable of performing GRB trigger distributing, automatic observation scheduling and observation coordination supporting by providing a user support platform. The FOCS also facilitates the provision of observational planning for ground-based telescopes to conduct synchronized observations of identical celestial regions as SVOM. The FOCS is utilized for the SVOM-dedicated ground-based telescopes as well as for associated partner telescopes. Since the launch of SVOM in June 2024, as the FOCS system joining the operations of SVOM, multiple successful observations have been made for SVOM GRBs. In this paper, we present the goals of the FOCS system as well as the principle and workflow developed to achieve these goals. The structure, technical design, implementation, and performance of the FOCS system are also described in detail. We conclude with a summary of the current status of the FOCS system and our near-future development plan.",

        "abstract": "We analyzed TESS archival data of three novae after recent outbursts, searching the orbital and white dwarf (WD) rotation period and possible variations of these periods. In V1405 Cas, we detected a period of $\\sim$116.88 seconds, which we identified as due to the WD spin, and measured a rate of increase of 0.001542$\\pm0.000009\\, {\\rm s\\, d}^{-1}$, one the fastest spin-down rates ever recorded. The rapid spin-down coupled with an X-ray luminosity several orders of magnitude lower than the available spin-down power, strongly indicates that the system is in a magnetic ``propeller'' state, namely the rotational energy powers the system's X-ray luminosity. We measured a previously unknown orbital period of 1.36 days for V1716 Sco. If the X-ray flux modulation with a period of 77.9 s detected in outburst for this nova is due to the rotation of an strongly magnetized white dwarf as in other novae with similar modulations of the supersoft X-ray source in outburst, the system is in a parameter space that challenges standard models of cataclysmic variable evolution. For V1674 Her, which has already been classified as an intermediate polar (IP), we confirm the known spin period of 501.33$\\pm$0.01 s and the orbital period of 0.1529$\\pm$0.0001 days, suggesting that the spin modulation was also the root cause of the periodicity in X-rays in outburst, and that the WD atmosphere in the supersoft X-ray phase was not thermally homogeneous. Our results highlight the power of high-cadence, continuous observations in revealing extreme and unexpected characteristics of accreting white dwarfs.",

In the fall of 2024 (September--November), BL Lacertae underwent another episode of strong optical activity, reaching an R-band magnitude of about 12 and showing extremely rapid and large-amplitude inter- and intra-night flux and polarization variations. During this period, the object was monitored over 40 nights using telescopes with an aperture of up to 2 m at three observatories: Rozhen and Belogradchik in Bulgaria and Skinakas in Greece. The results from this study include some of the most spectacular intra-night variability episodes detected in a blazar. These rapid variations, combined with high photometric accuracy and high time resolution, allowed for confirmation of consistency between different optical bands with zero time delays, down to a minute scale. Unlike previous activity reports, polarization was relatively stable on these short time-scales. Possible connections between polarization, flux, and intra-night variability were explored in order to better model or constrain the physical processes and emission mechanisms in the relativistic jets.",

Within a general-relativistic two-fluid framework that allows a covariantly conserved, gradient-driven energy exchange between baryons and the dark sector, we quantify how dark microphysics reshapes global structure when the total gravitational radius need not coincide with the luminous baryonic radius. Using a state-of-the-art baryonic equation of state, we explore the halo-forming mass range for fermionic dark matter with particle masses of 400 MeV and 1 GeV, and we characterize sequences by the difference between the total and luminous radii and by the fractional difference between the total and baryonic masses. We confirm established trends: lighter fermions typically support low-density halos that increase the total radius by several kilometers at nearly fixed mass, whereas masses near 1 GeV tend to shrink halos and make the two radii appreciably closer. Our central new result is that a percent-level vacuum-like admixture markedly reduces halo formation, shrinking the radius difference from several kilometers to sub-kilometer scales and the fractional mass difference to $\\lesssim 1\\%$. Combined gravitational-wave and X-ray observations offer a practical route to bound the halo size and the allowed vacuum-like fraction.",

Superflares were thoroughly investigated using broadband photometry predominantly from Kepler, K2, and TESS. Here we present a spectroscopic investigation of superflares on the very active spectroscopic binary CC~Eri. We focus on spectroscopic signatures of (super)-flares and line asymmetries with the goal to characterize superflares spectroscopically. In 70 nights of spectroscopic observations obtained at the ESO~1.52m telescope with the Echelle spectrograph PUCHEROS+ hosted by the PLATOSpec consortium we identified 31 flares from which two are superflares already from the deduced g'-band energies. We also find a broad blue-wing asymmetry occurring in the impulsive phase of another superflare which shows great potential to be a prominence eruption. For the second most luminous flare we find the largest number of excess emissions during the impulsive and gradual flare. We identify the flare to be occurring close to the stellar limb which indicates that the flare was even more energetic than derived from its g'-band and spectral line energies. We identify more than sixty spectral lines in the spectral range of 4100 and 7200\\AA{} showing excess emission during this flare. We detect continuum enhancements as well as photospheric line fillings during the flare. Generally we find that depending on the flare energy the number of spectral lines revealing excess emission increases, especially for the more energetic superflares. We therefore conclude that superflares are likely scaled-up versions of less energetic normal flares.",

        "abstract": "The chemistry of planetary atmospheres containing molecular nitrogen as a major atmospheric component is strongly influenced by the reactions of atomic nitrogen. Although nitrogen atoms in their ground electronic state N(4S) are mostly unreactive towards stable molecules, electronically excited nitrogen atoms N(2D) are much more reactive and could play an important role in the formation of nitriles and other nitrogen bearing organic molecules in planetary atmospheres such as Titan. Despite this, few kinetic studies of N(2D) reactions have been performed over the appropriate low temperature range. Here, we report the results of an experimental study of the reactions N(2D) + methylacetylene, CH3CCH, and N(2D) + acetonitrile, CH3CN, using a supersonic flow reactor at selected temperatures between 50 K and 296 K. N(2D) atoms, which were generated indirectly as a product of the C(3P) + NO reaction, were subsequently detected by laser induced fluorescence in the vacuum ultraviolet wavelength region. The measured rate constants are significantly larger than the estimated values in current photochemical models and do not display large variations as a function of temperature. The new rate constants are included in a 1D coupled ion-neutral model of Titans atmosphere to test their influence on the simulated species abundances. In addition, the overall description of both reactions is improved by considering the results of recent experimental and theoretical work examining the product channels of these processes. These simulations indicate that while the N(2D) + CH3CCH reaction has only a limited overall influence on Titans atmospheric chemistry, the N(2D) + CH3CN reaction could lead to the formation of significant relative abundances of cyanomethamine, HNCHCN, in the upper atmosphere.",

        "abstract": "Decades-long studies of asymmetric spectral lines in the solar corona suggest mass and energy transport from lower atmospheric layers to the corona. While slow magnetoacoustic waves and plasma flows are recognized as drivers of these spectral line asymmetries, the role of transverse MHD waves remains largely unexplored. Previous simulations have shown that unidirectionally propagating kink waves, in the presence of perpendicular density inhomogeneities, can produce a turbulence-like phenomenon called ``uniturbulence''. However, the spectroscopic signatures of this effect have not been investigated until now. Due to varying Doppler shifts from the plasma elements with different emissions, we expect to observe signatures of both blueward and redward asymmetries. Past instruments like EIS may have missed these signatures due to resolution limitations, but current instruments like DKIST offer a better opportunity for detection. We conducted 3D MHD simulations of transverse waves in a polar plume with density inhomogeneities and performed forward modeling for the Fe XIII emission line at 10749 \\AA. Our findings show that transverse waves and uniturbulence induce alternating red and blueward asymmetries, with magnitudes reaching up to 20\\% of peak intensity and secondary peak velocities between 30 and 40 km s$^{-1}$, remaining under 100 km s$^{-1}$. These asymmetries propagate with the transverse waves, and even at DKIST resolution, similar signatures can be detected. Our study suggests that spectral line asymmetries can serve as a diagnostic tool for detecting transverse wave-induced uniturbulence.",

However, humans are not the only instance of an intelligent, communicating species on Earth, and thus not guide to how we might think about ETI. Here, we explore the potential for the study of non-human species to inform new approaches in SETI research, using firefly communication patterns as an illustrative example. Fireflies communicate their presence through evolved flash patterns distinct from complex visual backgrounds. Extraterrestrial signals may also be identifiable not by their complexity or decodable content, but by the structural properties of the signal, as currently being explored in efforts to decode communication in non-human species across our biosphere. We present a firefly-inspired model for detecting potential technosignatures within environments dominated by ordered astronomical phenomena, such as pulsars. Using pulsar data from the Australia Telescope National Facility, we generate simulated signals that exhibit evolved dissimilarity from the surrounding pulsar population. This approach shifts focus from anthropocentric assumptions about intelligence toward recognizing communication through its fundamental structural properties, specifically, evolutionarily optimized contrast with natural backgrounds. Our model demonstrates that alien signals need not be inherently complicated nor need we decipher their meaning to identify them; rather, signals might be distinguishable as products of selection. We discuss implications for broadening SETI methodologies, leveraging the diverse forms of intelligence found on Earth.",

        "abstract": "In this manuscript, we recheck the spectroscopic properties of SDSS J134733.36+121724.27 (4C+12.50), confirming the presence of the double-peaked [O~{\\sc iii}]$\\lambda\\lambda4959,5007$\\AA\\ doublet and a broad H$\\alpha$. The former likely results from AGN-driven biconical outflows, while the absence of a broad H$\\beta$ supports a classification of the source as a Type-1.9 AGN. We analyze its high-quality Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) optical spectrum after robustly subtracting host galaxy and AGN continuum contributions through a simple stellar population fitting method employing 39 templates and a power-law continuum. Each narrow line of the [O~{\\sc iii}]$\\lambda\\lambda4959,5007$\\AA\\ doublet is better described by two Gaussian components (blue-shifted and red-shifted) than by a single Gaussian, as confirmed by the F-test. Broad components are included for both H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$, but only H$\\alpha$ reveals a significant detection, further supported by a comparison between the SDSS spectrum and that previously reported. These results support that the object is highly consistent with a Type-1.9 AGN classification, and the double-peaked [O~{\\sc iii}] profiles are most likely produced by AGN-driven biconical outflows rather than by a rotating narrow-line region or a dual AGN merger system. Additional observations are still needed to strengthen these conclusions.",

        "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the main drivers of disturbances in the solar heliosphere because they propagate and interact with the magnetic field of the solar wind. It is crucial to investigate the evolution of CMEs and their deformation for understanding the interaction between the solar wind and CMEs. We quantify the effect of the dynamic solar wind on the propagation of a CME in the heliosphere with a hydrodynamic plasma cloud-cone model and a linear force-free spheromak model at various locations in the heliosphere. We chose a CME event that launched on SOL2021-09-23T04:39:45 and was observed by multiple spacecraft, namely BepiColombo, Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, Stereo A and ACE. The solar wind was modelled in the steady and dynamic regimes in the Icarus model. The CME parameters were approximated for the selected event, and two CME models (spheromak and cone) were launched from the inner heliosphere boundary. The obtained synthetic in situ measurements were compared to the observed in situ measurements at all spacecraft. The internal magnetic field of the flux rope was better reconstructed by the spheromak model than by the cone CME model. The cone CME model maintained a nearly constant longitudinal angular extension while somewhat contracting in the radial direction. In contrast, the spheromak model contracted in the longitudinal direction while expanding in the radial direction. The CME sheath and magnetic cloud signatures were better reproduced at the four spacecraft clustered around the CME nose by the spheromak CME model. The dynamic solar wind caused a greater deceleration of the modelled CME than the steady-state solar wind solution. Because the background was homogeneous, the modelled CME properties were only mildly affected by the solar wind regime, however.",

However, the ability to observe evidence of Earth-like life through biosignatures is limited by the number of planets in the solar neighborhood with conditions similar to Earth. The occurrence rate of Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars, $\\eta_{\\oplus}$, is therefore crucial for addressing the apparent lack of consensus on its value in the literature. Here we present a review of the current understanding of $\\eta_{\\oplus}$. We first provide definitions for parameters that contribute to $\\eta_{\\oplus}$. Then, we discuss the previous and current estimated parameter values and the context of the limitations on the analyses that produced these estimates. We compile an extensive list of the factors that go into any calculation of $\\eta_{\\oplus}$, and how detection techniques and surveys differ in their sensitivity and ability to accurately constrain $\\eta_{\\oplus}$. Understanding and refining the value of $\\eta_{\\oplus}$ is crucial for upcoming missions and telescopes, such as the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory and the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets, which aim to search for biosignatures on exoplanets in the solar neighborhood.",

        "abstract": "Context: Ground-based telescopes are susceptible to seeing, an atmospheric phenomenon that reduces the resolving power of large observatories to that of a home telescope. Compensating these effects is therefore critical to realizing the potential of upcoming extremely large telescopes, a challenging task that requires precise wavefront control. Ultimately, this precision is limited by one's wavefront sensor (WFS) and its capacity to accurately encode phase and amplitude aberrations.   Aims: Our attention is on photon noise-limited wavefront sensing in the high-Strehl regime. In particular, we seek fundamental limits to phase and amplitude estimation in addition to a WFS that saturate these bounds.   Methods: Information theory is employed for deriving minimum-achievable residual errors, as stipulated by a metric called the Holevo Cramer-Rao bound. Holevo's bound is closely related to another metric called the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, which has already been applied to phase estimation on nearly-corrected wavefronts.   Results: We present a WFS that can perfectly extract and phase shift a telescope's piston mode. We show how this phase can be used to tune the apparatus' sensitivity to phase and amplitude, and provide a closed-form expression for the optimal phase shift. For circular apertures, this implementation saturates the fundamental limits, but it can be easily modified to work with arbitrary pupils. Moreover, our proposal uses optics that are manufactureable today and is readily achromatized with geometric phase shifters.",

        "abstract": "Coronal modelling is crucial for a better understanding of solar and helio-physics. Due to the strong brightness of the Sun and the lack of white light observations of the solar atmosphere and low corona (1-1.5R$_\\odot$), total solar eclipses have become a standard approach for validating the coronal models. In this study, we validate the COCONUT coronal model by predicting the coronal configuration during the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024. We aim to predict the accurate configuration of the solar corona during the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024. We utilise the full 3D MHD model to reconstruct the solar corona from the solar surface to $30\\;R_\\odot$. The upcoming total solar eclipse predictions were conducted in three different regimes: quasi-steady driving of the inner boundary conditions (BCs) with a daily cadence and dynamic driving of the inner BCs with both daily and hourly cadences. The results from all the simulations are compared to the total solar eclipse images. Additionally, the synthetic white-light (WL) images are generated from the STEREO-A field of view and compared to COR2 observed images. Normalised polarised brightness is compared in the COR2 and synthetic WL images. The predicted solar corona does not vary significantly in the first half of the prediction window. The dynamic simulations yielded better results than the quasi-steady predictions. The west limb was reconstructed better in the simulations than the east limb. We have predicted the total solar eclipse coronal configuration 18 days before the total solar eclipse. We can conclude that the dynamic simulations produced more accurate predictions. The availability of comprehensive observations is crucial, as the emergence of the active region on the east limb made it difficult to accurately predict the east limb coronal configuration due to incorrect input of magnetic field data.",

        "abstract": "We perform broadband spectral and timing studies of the Galactic low-mass black hole candidate AT2019wey during its 2022 outburst, using quasi-simultaneous observations from NICER, Swift, and NuSTAR. The long-term MAXI light curve, along with the hardness-intensity diagram (HID) derived from NICER data, indicates that the source remained in the hard state and did not switch to the soft state. Spectral modeling using two different model combinations reveals that the broadband spectrum is best described by two distinct Comptonizing regions, associated reflection components, and thermal emission from the disk. The harder Comptonizing region dominates ($\\gtrsim88\\%$) the total flux and is primarily responsible for the observed reflection features from the distant part of the disk. We find that the accretion disk is truncated at a radius of $\\sim16-56~r_{\\rm{g}}$, while the luminosity is $\\sim1.9\\%$ of the Eddington limit. Our spectral results also show consistency in the estimated inner disk radius obtained through two independent methods: modeling the disk continuum and the reflection spectrum. The variability studies imply the presence of intrinsic disk variability, likely originating from an instability in the disk. We also detect hard time lags at low frequencies, possibly arising from the inward propagation of mass accretion rate fluctuations from the outer to the inner regions of the accretion disk. Moreover, an observed deviation of the lag-energy spectrum from the log-linear trend at $\\lesssim 0.7$ keV is most likely attributed to thermal reverberation, arising from the reprocessing of hard coronal photons in the accretion disk.",

The most prominent features are the three periods $P_1 = 26.5$ d, $P_2 = 26.9$ d, and $P_{\\rm long} = 4.6$ years. Occasionally, a fourth period of 26.7 d is also detected. Mathematically, these four periods are interrelated via the interference pattern of a beating. Competing scenarios that seek to determine which of these periods are physical and which are secondary are under debate. The detection of a fifth period, $P_3 = 26.3$ d, was recently claimed. Our aim is to determine which of these periods are intrinsic (likely related to physical processes) and which of these are secondary (resulting from interference). We avoided any assumption about the physical scenario and restricted our analysis to the phenomenology of the radio emission variability. We selected intervals from archival radio data and applied the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We fit the observational data to generate synthetic data that only contain specific signals. We analyzed these synthetic data to assess the impact of these signals and their interference on the light curves and the periodogram. The two-peaked profile, consisting of $P_1$ and $P_2$, was detected in the periodogram of the actual data for intervals that are significantly shorter than $P_{\\rm long}$, provided that these intervals contain a minimum of the long-term modulation. The characteristics of the observational data and their periodogram could only be reproduced with synthetic data if these explicitly included all three periods $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_{\\rm long}$, the residuals being limited by noise. We have found that all three periods, i.e., $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_{\\rm long}$, could correspond to physically real processes occurring in LS I +61 303.",

Cosmic rays that are accelerated in astrophysical sources can escape from their jets and interact with background radiation fields. Interactions with the extragalactic background light can produce pions and hence neutrinos, while interactions with the cosmic microwave background predominantly drive inverse Compton scattering, contributing to electromagnetic cascades in intergalactic space. The resulting secondary gamma-ray emission can be detected with high-energy gamma-ray telescopes. Here, we report on a new search for such cosmogenic cascade emission from the blazar TXS 0506+056, using a combined data set from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope and VERITAS. We compare the gamma-ray spectrum and neutrino observations with the predictions of cosmic-ray induced cascades in intergalactic space. The observed gamma-ray spectrum is modeled as a combination of the primary spectrum and the cascade spectrum. We apply a Monte Carlo simulation with a $\\Delta\\chi^2$-based likelihood analysis to jointly determine the best-fit parameters of a proton emission spectrum describing the data and derive constraints on the proton escape luminosity.

        "abstract": "We present the results of the 2023 spectroscopic reverberation mapping (RM) campaign for active galactic nuclei (AGN) of NGC 5548, continuing our long-term monitoring program. Using the Lijiang 2.4-meter telescope, we obtained 74 spectra with a median cadence of 1.9 days. Through detailed spectral decomposition, we measured the light curves of the optical continuum at 5100~\\AA\\ and the broad He~{\\sc ii}, He~{\\sc i}, H$\\gamma$, and H$\\beta$ emission lines. The time lags of these lines relative to the continuum are measured as $1.3^{+1.6}_{-0.6}$, $2.3^{+1.5}_{-2.1}$, $10.0^{+2.0}_{-1.8}$, and $15.6^{+2.6}_{-2.9}$ days (rest-frame), respectively. Velocity-resolved lag profiles for H$\\gamma$ and H$\\beta$ were constructed. Combined with data from previous seasons (2015$-$2021), we find that the radial ionization stratification of the broad-line region (BLR) is stable; the average virial mass of the supermassive black hole in NGC~5548 is $(2.6\\pm1.1)\\times 10^{8}M_{\\odot}$, consistent with the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma_*$ relation; the broad He~{\\sc ii} line exhibits the largest responsivity, followed by broad He~{\\sc i} (or H$\\gamma$) and H$\\beta$ lines; the BLR kinematics show significant temporal evolution, transitioning from virialized motions to signatures of inflow and outflow. Furthermore, an analysis of 35 years of historical data confirms a 3.5-year time lag between variations in the optical luminosity and the BLR radius, potentially implicating the role of radiation pressure or dynamical structure changes in the inner accretion disk. Long-term campaign demonstrates that the BLR in NGC 5548 is a robust yet dynamically evolving entity, providing crucial insights into AGN structure and accretion physics.",

        "title": "Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: End-to-End Performance Modeling of Optical System",
        "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive end-to-end simulation analysis of the optical imaging performance of the China Survey Space Telescope (CSST) under in-orbit conditions. An integrated system model incorporating five static and two dynamic error sub-models was established. Wavefront errors were calculated for each sub-model and compared to the integrated system error to quantify the individual contributions to image degradation. At the detector level, wavefront error, point spread function (PSF), and ellipticity were evaluated across the full field of view (FOV). The average radius of 80\\% encircled energy (REE80) of the PSF under full-error conditions was determined for 25 field points, yielding a value of 0.114 arcseconds. Furthermore, the calculations indicate a correlation between the wavefront distribution and the ellipticity distribution within the optical system. By optimizing the wavefront distribution, it is possible to adjust the ellipticity distribution of the PSF across the full FOV. The end-to-end simulation approach adopted in this paper provides a theoretical foundation for improving the image quality in large-aperture, off-axis space telescopes.",

        "title": "Relevance of Murchison Widefield Array Interplanetary Scintillation Observations to Heliospheric Transient Catalogues",
        "abstract": "We have conducted a comprehensive comparison of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations taken by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) with several heliospheric transient event catalogues, over a time period of 7 months during solar minimum. From this analysis we have found that of the 84% of catalogued events that have MWA IPS data available, 68% of them appear in MWA observations. Of the enhancements first identified in IPS observations, only 58% have a potential match with a catalogued event. The majority of enhancements that were identified in the IPS observations were situated greater than 10$^\\circ$ from the ecliptic plane. Two such features were selected for detailed analysis, connecting their solar origins to their propagation through the heliosphere. The first of these features was created by a coronal mass ejection (CME), captured over two successive MWA observations and recorded in several catalogues. The second feature has the potential of being a stream interaction region (SIR) travelling out of the ecliptic plane. This particular SIR was not recorded in any catalogue. Thus the MWA shows promise in detecting heliospheric transients that other commonly-used techniques may overlook. These results show the strength of the MWA in having unbridled access to the heliosphere, able to make remote observations of events far out of the ecliptic as it is not restrained to the orbits of spacecraft. We demonstrate how the inclusion of MWA IPS data can potentially boost the number of CME and SIR events that are characterised.",

        "title": "Nearly forgotten results in development of physical cosmology",
        "abstract": "It would be reasonable to recall some critical issues in physical cosmology development. GR was created by A. Einstein in 1915. In 1917 Einstein proposed the first (static) cosmological model. Soon after the A. Eddington proved that the model is unstable therefore it can not be realizable in nature. In 1922 and 1924 A. A. Friedmann found non-stationary solutions for cosmological equations written in the framework of GR. In 1927 G. Lemaitre obtained very similar results and, in addition, he derived the Hubble law (E. Hubble obtained this law from observations). Unfortunately, G. Lemaitre published his paper in not very popular Belgium journal. In 1931 Lemaitre proposed the first version of hot Universe model (he called it hypothesis of the primeval atom). In his book Lemaitre predicted even a background radiation as a signature of his model.   One of the important property of the Lemaitre -- Gamow model was a prediction of CMB radiation with a temperature around a few K. It was recalled that the discovery of CMB radiation was done by T. Shmaonov in 1956 and his paper was published in 1957 (several years before Penzias and Wilson).   In 1965, 1970 E. B. Gliner proposed vacuum like equation of matter which could correspond to exponential explosion of the Universe which was later called inflation. For decades in USSR, Friedmann's cosmological non-stationary models were treated as purely mathematical results without cosmologocal applications. On September 16, 1925 passed away untimely and it would be reasonable to remind today his great contribution in physical cosmology since the authors of book on Friedmann wrote that \"similarly to Copernicus who forced the Earth to move Friedmann forced the Universe to expand\".",

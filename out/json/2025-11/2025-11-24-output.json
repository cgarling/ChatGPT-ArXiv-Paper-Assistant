We find a large scatter in their HI density profiles and $M_\\mathrm{HI} - M_\\mathrm{*}$ relation, which cannot be fully explained by current halo mass or concentration, but can be attributed to ram pressure stripping in dense environments, past mergers, and stellar feedback. In particular, close encounters with massive halos and dense environments can reshape the HI content, which may explain the asymmetric HI map of an intriguing observed analogue, Cloud-9. An empirical fit, $n = 0.25 \\left(d_\\mathrm{MW}/{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}\\right)^{-1.4}\\, \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$, based on their number density extended to 3.7 Mpc in constrained local volume simulations, is also provided to aid observational forecasts.

The magnitude of the red giant branch tip was used to measure a distance of D=3.06 (+0.17/-0.14) Mpc, much more accurate and precise than the estimate previously available in the literature, based on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (D=2.0 (+1.7/-0.8) Mpc).

The dwarf populates the extreme low-mass tail of the M_* distribution of gas-rich galaxies but it is significantly more massive than the faintest local gas-rich dwarfs, Leo T and Leo P.

However, the estimation of the baryon mass depends critically on several assumptions regarding the gas density profile, temperature, metallicity, and the underlying halo mass distribution. Here, we assess how these assumptions affect the inferred baryon mass of the X-ray-emitting CGM in MW-mass galaxies, based on the stacked eROSITA signal. We find that variations in temperature profiles and uncertainties in the halo mass introduce the dominant sources of uncertainty, resulting in X-ray-emitting baryon mass estimates that vary by nearly a factor of four ($0.8-3.5\\times10^{11} M_\\odot$). Assumptions about metallicity contribute an additional uncertainty of approximately $50\\%$. We emphasize that accurate X-ray spectral constraints on gas temperature and metallicity, along with careful modeling of halo mass uncertainty, are essential for accurately estimating the baryon mass for MW-mass galaxies. Future X-ray microcalorimeter missions will be crucial for determining the hot CGM properties and closing the baryon census at the MW-mass scale.",

        "abstract": "Gravitational lensing observables, including anomalies in image positions, flux ratios, and time delays, serve as usual probes of dark matter (DM) substructure. When dark matter substructure possesses sufficient perturbations, it may lead to the formation of extra images in otherwise canonical doubly or quadruply imaged systems. With the advent of increasingly precise observational instruments, previously undetectable images may become measurable and image number anomalies therefore could be an increasingly viable method. In this paper, we utilize the gravitational lensing phenomenon of image number anomaly to derive constraints on dark matter substructure. We present the extra images induced by distinct forms of DM substructure, specifically primordial black holes (PBHs) and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and show that higher angular resolution observations increase the probability of detecting additional lensed images. Based on a null detection of image number anomalies in a sample of 3500 lens systems generated from the \\textit{Strong Lensing Halo model-based mock catalogs} (SL-Hammocks), we derive upper limits on the abundance of PBHs. At the 95\\% confidence level, the PBH abundance is constrained to $\\lesssim 0.125\\%$, $0.08\\%$, and $0.04\\%$ for PBH masses in the range $\\sim 10^{7}$--$10^{9}~M_{\\odot}$, corresponding to angular resolutions of $0.1''$, $0.05''$, and $0.01''$, respectively. Similarly, we exclude particle masses below $0.4$, $0.6$, and $3.5 \\times 10^{-22} \\ \\mathrm{eV}$ for FDM at the same confidence level for the respective resolutions. Furthermore, the abundance of PBHs $\\lesssim 0.9\\%$ could be constrained at an angular resolution of $0.5''$ for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Observations. Finally, we discuss methodologies for identifying image number anomalies in special cases and demonstrate feasibility using a fitting procedure.",

        "abstract": "Spectral data reduction pipelines deal with a wide variety of challenges including masking cosmic rays, calibrating wavelength solutions, and estimating background noise while trying to remain model-agnostic. Traditional methods rely on hardware-specific code or pre-calculated stellar model templates to solve this problem, making them model-dependent and not suitable for large datasets that may contain new classes of objects. To solve this problem, we present a flexible, data-driven method: the GausSian PIxelwise Conditional Estimator (GSPICE) that models an ensemble of spectra as a multivariate Gaussian and estimates the expected value and expected variance of each pixel in each spectrum conditional on others. GSPICE compares observed fluxes and errors to its own flux and error estimates to reveal outliers, which then can be completely masked or replaced by their estimates. We apply GSPICE to 3.9 million stellar spectra from the LAMOST survey, and show that variations of the method can directly identify and correct both individual pixel-level outliers (e.g., from cosmic ray hits) as well as extended systematic features (e.g., from incorrect wavelength calibrations), while still providing a novel characterization of the true per-pixel measurement uncertainties. We also demonstrate how GSPICE can take advantage of data partitioning with an application to diffuse interstellar bands. Implementations of GSPICE in both Python and IDL can be found here http://github.com/dfink/gspice.",

In addition to depleting the gas reservoir of galaxies, outflows also enrich their circumgalactic medium (CGM) with processed gas -- which can further impact the next stages of gas accretion, resulting in the presence of molecular gas beyond the stellar component of galaxies, out to CGM scales. Here, we aim to search for cold molecular gas (MH2) in the CGM of typical main-sequence (MS) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at cosmic noon (zmed=1.3), where we expect outflows to be particularly prominent. Using Band 3 CO(2-1) data from the Atacama Large Millimeter and submillimeter Array (ALMA), we study the spatial extent of the MH2 of a sample of 26 SFGs, via stacking techniques. We compare this extent to that of the stacked stellar emission of our sample traced by UltraVISTA Ks band data. We also search for broad wings in the stacked spectrum which can be indicative of ongoing outflows. Within the noise level of the observations, we find that the total intrinsic MH2 of our sample spatially extends to scales of ~12 kpc, similarly to the stellar emission (~13 kpc). We do not find broad wings in the stacked spectrum that could hint at ongoing molecular outflows, but we find a tentative minor excess of CO(2-1) emission at negative velocities that might be indicative of outflows, where the redshifted gas is optically thick. The absence of high-velocity molecular gas suggests that molecular outflows traced by CO(2-1) emission are weak in MS SFGs at cosmic noon. These weak outflows thus fail to expel a significant amount of molecular gas to CGM scales, as indicated by the absence of molecular emission extending beyond the stellar emission region. This lack of CO emission at large radii could also imply that the molecular gas does not survive at such distances.",

The merger orbits for the matched pairs in the TNG100-1 and the TNG100-1-Dark simulations are similar right after infall, and both evolve to more head-on orbits at final stages, with smaller changes in the hydrodynamical simulation.

Many studies in the literature model PNe using the blackbody approximation (bb) or plane-parallel (p-p) atmospheres as the ionizing source. However, these approaches become inconsistent when the central star is a Wolf-Rayet ([WR]) type. These objects are hydrogen-deficient and exhibit intense stellar winds, similar to classical massive WR stars. Their accurate description therefore requires sophisticated NLTE expanding atmosphere models. In this work, we selected [WR] NLTE expanding-atmosphere models spanning a range of temperatures and mass-loss rates and compared them with bb and p-p models. We examined differences in the spectral energy distribution and ionizing photon fluxes for H I, He I, and He II to assess the impact of stellar winds on the nebula-star interaction. Using CLOUDY, we also evaluated how each ionizing source affects predicted line ratios (I$_{\\lambda}$/I$_{\\beta}$) for a sample of PNe with [WR] nuclei. Model performance was measured through the rms deviation between observed and predicted ratios. For temperatures below 100,000 K, the EUV spectrum differs strongly among the three model types. Stellar winds introduce substantial opacity, reducing log Q(He II) significantly relative to no-wind models. For hotter [WR] stars, wind effects on ionizing fluxes are much smaller. For nebulae hosting late-type [WR] stars, models including winds provide much better agreement with observed line ratios than bb or p-p models, whereas for early-type stars the choice of ionizing source has only a minor influence. Our results indicate that bb and p-p approximations should be avoided when modelling PNe with [WR] central stars, especially those of the [WCL] subtype, because they fail to reproduce the strong wind-modified ionizing spectra.",

This approach provides a physical motivation to parametrise the non-universality of the HMF in terms of the recent history of structure formation and the local shape of the linear matter power spectrum. Our model was calibrated against measurements from N-body simulations, with halo samples defined by ten overdensity thresholds, $\\Delta$, ranging from 150 to 1600 times the mean background matter density. For our reference mass definition, $\\Delta=200$, the calibrated fitting function achieves per cent-level accuracy across a wide range of masses, redshifts, and structure formation histories, and maintains this performance when tested on cosmologies with different linear power spectrum shapes. This high level of accuracy is maintained across other mass definitions, degrading only slightly to the 5 per cent level at the highest values of $\\Delta$. We also provide fitting formulae to interpolate the parameters as a function of $\\Delta$, which allows for accurate modelling of HMFs defined by intermediate overdensities, with accuracy still well within 5 per cent when tested on halo catalogues defined by the virial overdensity threshold. Compared to other commonly used recipes, our prescription yields competitive or superior accuracy across all redshifts and cosmologies, successfully capturing the non-universal features of the HMF where other models exhibit systematic deviations. This work provides a high-precision modelling tool for cluster abundance analyses, and demonstrates the power of the evolution mapping framework for building accurate models of observables in the non-linear regime.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the relation between the surface density of star formation rate (SFR) ($\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SFR}}$), stellar mass ($\\Sigma_{M_{\\ast}}$), and molecular gas mass ($\\Sigma_{M_\\mathrm{mol}}$) on nearly 1 kpc scales averaged over concentric tilted rings using the $^{12}$CO $J=1-0$ mapping data of 92 nearby galaxies obtained in the CO Multi-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING) project. We categorized these galaxies into three groups based on the deviation of each global SFR from the star-forming main sequence (MS), $\\Delta$MS: upper MS (UMS), MS, and lower MS (LMS). UMS galaxies tend to be less massive or barred spiral galaxies, exhibiting molecular gas fraction ($f_{\\mathrm{gas}}$) comparable to those of MS galaxies but higher star formation efficiency (SFE). In contrast, the LMS galaxies tend to be massive or active galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Their $f_{\\mathrm{gas}}$ values are lower than those of MS galaxies, and their SFEs are slightly lower or comparable to those of MS galaxies in the inner region. These trends indicate that enhanced SFE contributes to higher $\\Delta$MS values, whereas reduced $f_{\\mathrm{gas}}$ results in lower $\\Delta$MS values. The less prominent bulge or the presence of a bar structure in UMS galaxies induces disk-wide star formation, consequently increasing the SFE. In LMS galaxies, the molecular gas is exhausted, and their star formation activity is low. Environmental effects, such as tidal gas stripping, may also reduce gas supply from the outer regions. Furthermore, our sample galaxies show that both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and $f_{\\mathrm{gas}}$ decrease in the central region in LMS galaxies but did not change in the same region in UMS galaxies. These results seem to support the inside-out quenching of star formation although the dominant cause of depletion remains uncertain.",

Traditionally, these environments are categorized into four fixed classifications: knots, filaments, walls, and voids, which collectively describe the complex organization of galaxies within large-scale structures. We propose an alternative description that complements the traditional quadripartite categorization by introducing a continuous framework, allowing for a more nuanced examination of the relationship between the intrinsic properties of galaxies and their environments. This complementary description is applied using one of the most prevalent methodologies: categorization using the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix extracted from the matter density field. We integrated our findings into a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, combined with cosmological numerical simulations, to analyze how the intrinsic properties of galaxies are influenced by environmental changes. In our study, we find a continuous distribution of eigenvalue ratios, revealing a clear dependence of galaxy properties on their surrounding environments. This method allowed us to identify critical values at which transitions in the behavior of key astrophysical galaxy properties become evident.",

        "abstract": "We present ViSta, a Visibility Stacking method to combine interferometric observations in the Fourier domain at radio to sub-millimeter wavelengths for galaxies. The goal of our method is to maximize the exploitation of available archival interferometric data. By stacking visibilities of galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts directly in the Fourier domain and transforming them into the rest-frame, we can enhance the stacked signal, suppress noise, and improve image reconstruction thanks to an extended coverage of the visibility domain. The ViSta method is highly flexible, allowing stacking of visibilities regardless of the array configuration or spectral setup. It is effective for both targeted sources and spurious detections offset from the phase center, whether unresolved or extended, within the field of view of the telescope. We validated the method using simulated interferometric datasets. For point-like sources, we can reconstruct the true emission with approximately 90% accuracy, obtaining similar results to classical image-plane stacking. In contrast, for faint and extended sources below the noise level, our method can provide a more accurate estimate of the signal compared to traditional image-based approaches. Finally, we applied ViSta to a sample of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) to detect the CO(3-2) emission line. As for the simulated case, we demonstrated that our tool performs better than image-plane stacking when the signal from individual sources is no longer easily detectable, achieving higher SNR. Finally, we outline potential future applications of this stacking approach.",

        "abstract": "(abridged) After more than 10yr of ALMA operations, the community interest in conducting deep, extra-galactic, millimetre surveys resulted in varying strategic compromises between areal size and map depth to survey the sky. The current bias leans towards a galaxy population found in the field or towards rich star-bursty proto-cluster groups, both tendentiously surveyed at coarse spatial resolutions. Here, we describe a deep 3mm ALMA survey in long-baselines on a 1x1arcmin2 region in the Hubble Deep Field South, also covered by the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) in order to assess resolved molecular gas properties in galaxies in group environments at z>1. ALMA observations comprising a 4-pointing mosaic with a single Band3 (3mm) spectral tuning were conducted to cover CO transitions from different groups identified by MUSE. This work consists in a total effective time on source of 61h in configurations with up to 15km baselines. The final data-set yields an angular resolution of 0.15\"-0.2\" (imaging weights dependent) and maximum recoverable scales of 1\"-2\". The final continuum map reaches a sensitivity of rms~2uJy/beam, allowing the detection of three sources at 3mm (only one showing multi-wavelength counterparts). Moreover, we detect six line emitters associated with CO J=2-1 at zspec=1.284, one of them previously undetected by MUSE and none detected in 3mm continuum. The inter-stellar medium gas masses range from ~2E9 to ~9E10 Msun (adopting alphaCO=4Msun/(K.km/s.pc2), including Helium). Overall, this galaxy group is quite diverse with no two galaxies alike, some showing clear physical offsets with respect to Hubble imaging tracing rest-frame ultra-violet emission. We also derive cosmic molecular gas mass densities using this sample as a reference for group environments, and we find that these yield comparable densities as the galaxy population found in field environments.",

We use LAE surface density maps in the N419 (z $\\sim$ 2.45) and N501 (z $\\sim$ 3.12) narrow bands to probe the relationship between local environmental density and the Ly$\\alpha$ line profile. In both narrow bands, we stack the LAE spectra in bins of environmental density and inside and outside of protocluster regions. The N501 data shows $\\sim$15% higher Ly$\\alpha$ line luminosity for galaxies in protoclusters, suggesting increased star formation in these regions. However, the line luminosity is not appreciably greater in protocluster galaxies in the N419 band, suggesting a potential redshift evolution of this effect. The shape of the line profile itself does not vary with environmental density, suggesting that line shape changes are caused by local effects independent of a galaxy's environment. These data indicate a potential relationship between LAE local environmental density, ionized gas distribution, and Ly$\\alpha$ line luminosity.",

In this domain, galaxy emission consists of thermal dust, free-free and synchrotron emissions with a possible additional contribution from anomalous microwave emission (AME) peaking near 1 cm.The aim of this study is to accurately characterize the integrated spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies in the mm-cm range. We used COBE-DIRBE, IRAS, Planck, and WMAP all-sky surveys, brought to the same resolution of $1^\\circ$, to cover 18 photometric bands from 97$\\mu$m to 1.3 cm. Given the low angular resolution and mixing with foreground and background emission that hampers the detection of the galaxy, our sample consists of 6 of the brightest, nearby galaxies: LMC, SMC, M31, M33, NGC 253 and NGC 4945. We subtract Milky Way dust emission, distant unresolved galaxies, and foreground point sources in the fields. We fit each integrated SED with a model of thermal dust, free-free, synchrotron, AME and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature fluctuations. The integrated SEDs of our sample of galaxies are well fitted by the model within the uncertainties, although degeneracies between the different components contributing to the mm-cm emission complicate the estimation of their individual contributions. We do not clearly detect AME in any of our target galaxies, and AME emissivity upper limits are weak compared to Galactic standards, suggesting that the signal of AME might be diluted at the scale of a whole galaxy. We infer positive CMB fluctuations in the background of 5 out of our 6 galaxies. This effect might be related to the degeneracy between the dust emissivity index and CMB fluctuations in the background, or linked to the specific spatial distribution of CMB fluctuations coupled with the low resolution and small number statistics.",

        "abstract": "In relativistic cosmology, the formation of nonlinear inhomogeneities can induce non-negligible backreaction on late-time expansion. Among the important consequences for precision cosmology is the potential impact on the linear growth of large-scale structures. We address this impact by combining covariant spatial averaging with covariant and gauge-invariant perturbation theory. We focus on irrotational dust model spacetimes. The effects of backreaction and nontrivial dynamical curvature on the average cosmological dynamics are formulated as the addition of an effective perfect fluid with pressure. We then introduce an effective background driven by both the averaged dust density and the emergent effective fluid, and derive the general evolution equations for linear perturbations of this system. The residual freedom in this framework amounts to specifying the properties of the effective-fluid perturbations as a closure condition. We analyse two physically motivated choices for this condition. In addition, we clarify the conditions under which the coupling between linear structure growth and perturbations of the effective fluid can be neglected. Finally, we apply this formalism to four examples of averaged cosmological models from the literature, three of which -- intended as effective full descriptions of the largest scales -- have been shown to provide a good fit to observational data. Our results highlight the importance of backreaction effects in shaping linear structure growth in such models. Neglecting these effects may thus lead to biased predictions for the development of large structures, even when the models provide a good description of the general background observables.",

        "abstract": "We present the results of molecular line observations toward the W40 and Serpens South regions of the Aquila molecular cloud complex, conducted as part of the TRAO-FUNS project to investigate the role of filamentary structures in the formation of dense cores and stars in molecular clouds. We performed a Gaussian decomposition of the C$^{18}$O spectra to disentangle multiple velocity components along the line-of-sight and a `Friends-of-Friends' algorithm on these decomposed components to identify 24 velocity-coherent filaments in the observed region. The `FellWalker' algorithm is applied on the N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ integrated intensity map to identify the dense cores embedded within the filaments. Many of the filaments previously identified from the Herschel survey are found to contain multiple velocity-coherent filaments. Virial analysis indicated that all of our identified filaments are thermally supercritical and gravitationally bound. Velocity gradients are observed along the filaments in the vicinity of embedded dense cores, indicating the presence of longitudinal flows that contribute to core formation. The median mass flow rate across the observed region is estimated to be $\\sim$35 M$_{\\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, with Serpens South showing a rate $\\sim$40\\% higher than W40. The analysis of non-thermal motions revealed that the dense cores mainly show subsonic to transonic motions, while their host filaments are mostly supersonic, suggesting that the turbulent motions in filaments may dissipate on smaller scales, allowing core formation. These findings highlight the essential role of the filaments' criticality, mass flow, and turbulent dissipation in the formation of dense cores within the filaments.",

        "abstract": "The data storage requirements for deep spectral line observations with next-generation radio interferometers like the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are extremely challenging. The default strategy is to reduce data after each daily observation and stack the resulting images. Although this approach is computationally efficient, it risks propagating systematic errors and significantly degrades the final data quality. However, storage and computation requirements for a traditional way to image the entire deep dataset together are prohibitively expensive. We present an alternative \\textit{uv}-grid stacking method and compare its scientific outcomes with both the traditional approach, which processes all data jointly and serves as the best-possible result, and the default image-stacking method. Our technique involves halting the standard imaging pipeline after the daily residual visibility grids are formed. These grids are then stacked and jointly deconvolved to combine many epochs of data. Using the traditional approach as a benchmark, we show that image-stacking recovers only 92\\% of the true {\\HI} flux. In contrast, our \\textit{uv}-grid stacking method recovers 99\\%, which is in excellent agreement with the traditional method within the noise limits. Furthermore, image-stacking introduces significant non-physical artefacts, such as negative bowls around strong sources, indicating poor deconvolution and a loss of physical information. Based on these findings, we intend to apply the \\textit{uv}-grid stacking to the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) survey on ASKAP and strongly recommend this or a similar approach for future radio astronomy facilities.",

Several studies showed that if the rest of DM is made of thermal particles, then these should accumulate around such PBHs, leading to the formation of very dense spikes in the radiation era. We contributed a detailed analytical study about this phenomenon, providing clear explanations as for the origin of scaling relations in the form of power-law density profiles with up to 3 different spectral indices, i.e. $3/4$, $3/2$, and $9/4$, and 4 asymptotic regimes. Here, we further derive an approximate analytical solution that enables fast numerical predictions for the density profiles of these spikes. We also address the specific case of self-annihilating DM species and derive new approximate analytical formulae. Our approximate density yields the correct annihilation rate within $\\pm 15\\%$ precision. We then focus on indirect detection in the cosmic microwave background and in extragalactic gamma-rays. We shed new and subtle light on how mutually exclusive PBHs and self-annihilating DM species can really be. In particular, the discovery of a population of sub-solar PBHs would set stringent constraints on the $s$-wave annihilation cross-section of these particles, a point so far missed in the literature.",

The next frontier for science archives is to enable searches not only on observational metadata, but also on the content of the observations themselves.

To achieve this we use self-supervised contrastive affine-transformation-independent representation learning of source morphologies with a deep neural network. For a given image on the ASA web interface, astronomers are presented with a summary view of the morphologically most similar images. Each time an astronomer selects an additional image from that view, the display is instantly updated to show the images most similar to the combination of the selected images. Each selection thus refines the similarity display according to the scientific needs of the astronomer.

In this paper we present spectroscopic and photometric results of 15 transient sources pre-classified as AM CVn candidates. Our analysis confirms 9 systems of the type AM CVn, 3 hydrogen-rich cataclysmic variables (accreting white dwarfs with near-main-sequence stars for donors) and 3 systems that could be evolved cataclysmic variables. Eight of the AM CVn stars are analysed spectroscopically for the first time, which increases the number of spectroscopically confirmed AM CVns by about $10\\%$. TESS data revealed the orbital period of the AM CVn star ASASSN-20pv to be $P_\\mathrm{orb}=27.282\\,\\mathrm{min}$, which helps to constrain the possible values of its mass ratio. TESS also helped to determine the superhump periods of one AM CVn star (ASASSN-19ct, $P_\\mathrm{sh}=30.94\\,\\mathrm{min}$) and two cataclysmic variables we classify as WZ Sge stars ($P_\\mathrm{sh}=90.77\\,\\mathrm{min}$ for ZTF18aaaasnn and $P_\\mathrm{sh}=91.6\\,\\mathrm{min}$ for ASASSN-15na). We identified very different abundances in the spectra of the AM CVns binaries ASASSN-15kf and ASASSN-20pv (both $P_\\mathrm{orb}\\sim 27.5$ min), suggesting different type of donors. Six of the studied AM CVns are X-ray sources, which helped to determine their mass accretion rates. Photometry shows that the duration of all the superoutbursts detected in the AM CVns is consistent with expectations from the disc instability model.

Notably, we employ a single-fluid approximation for the first time in this context, wherein the baryonic and DM contributions to the total energy density and pressure are treated within a unified framework, assuming non-interacting fermionic DM in hydrostatic equilibrium with baryons. We examine how variations in $m_{\\mathrm{DM}}$ and $f_\\mathrm{DM}$ modify the equation of state (EoS), the mass-radius relationship, and the internal mass and pressure distributions of WDs. Our results show that the presence of DM softens the EoS, with lighter DM particles providing stronger pressure support and leading to more extended stellar structures. Increasing the DM mass fraction leads to a more compact configuration, reducing both the radius and maximum mass of the WD. We further demonstrate that heavier DM particles enhance stellar compactness and can eventually drive the star toward gravitational instability. Moreover, the analysis of mass-radius relationships reveals that while small fractions of DM are consistent with observed WD masses, the radii predicted by our models are smaller than observations, suggesting additional influences such as rotation or magnetic fields. Our stability analysis confirms that the inclusion of dark matter does not lead to instability within the expected parameter space, indicating that white dwarfs admixed with dark matter can remain dynamically stable under certain conditions. These findings show that even a small admixture of DM can modify the structural properties and stability limits of WDs, providing a potential indirect astrophysical probe of DM particle properties.",

        "abstract": "Hints of a dynamical dark-energy equation of state have appeared in several combined cosmological probes. However, such indications may instead arise from the intrinsic likelihood geometry of individual datasets, residual inter-probe tension, or restrictive priors. These factors can mimic evidence for dynamical dark energy. To clarify these issues, we perform a controlled null test. We use realistic mock BAO, CMB, and Type~Ia supernova datasets generated from a common fiducial LambdaCDM cosmology. These mocks include the DESI~DR2 BAO covariance, the Planck~2018 distance-prior covariance, and the full Pantheon+ SH0ES supernova covariance. This setup isolates physical information from geometric or statistical effects in the CPL parametrization. We find that individual probes and most two-probe combinations show apparent deviations in the (w0,wa) plane. These could be mistaken for phantom crossing or evolving dark energy. Two-probe combinations including supernovae (BAO+SNe, CMB+SNe) recover values near (w0,wa)=(-1,0) but fail to reconstruct (Omegam0,H0), because SNe do not determine the absolute distance scale. Combinations without SNe (BAO+CMB), as well as any single dataset, retain strong degeneracy directions. These produce significant shifts driven purely by likelihood geometry. These behaviors arise because BAO, CMB, and SNe each constrain only one principal direction in (w0,wa) space. Their degeneracy ridges are misaligned due to distinct redshift sensitivities. In contrast, the full BAO+CMB+SNe likelihood with proper covariance breaks all degeneracies simultaneously. It cleanly recovers the fiducial cosmology, including (w0,wa)=(-1,0) and (Omegam0,H0). Our results provide a transparent benchmark for assessing future claims of omega(z) neq -1. They emphasize the need for complete multi-probe analyses with flexible H0 and rd priors.",

        "abstract": "We study the application of deep learning techniques to the analysis and classification of ions accelerated at collisionless shocks in hybrid (kinetic ions--fluid electrons) simulations. Ions were classified as thermal, suprathermal, or nonthermal, depending on the energy they achieved and the acceleration regime they fell under. These classifications were used to train deep learning models to predict which particles are injected into the acceleration process with high accuracy (>90%), using only time series of the local magnetic field they experienced during their initial interaction with the shock. An autoencoder architecture was also tested, for which time series of various parameters were reconstructed from encoded representations. This study shows the potential of applying machine learning techniques to extract physical insights from kinetic plasma simulations and sets the groundwork for future applications, including the construction of sub-grid models in fluid approaches.",

        "abstract": "We consider the cosmological history of a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) coupled to a light axion-like particle (ALP) via a quadratic coupling. Although the coupling is too feeble to thermalize the ALP, coherent forward scattering between the two sectors induces temperature-dependent mass shifts that substantially modify both WIMP freeze-out and ALP misalignment dynamics, giving rise to a novel coherent freeze-out mechanism. At high temperatures, the WIMP thermal bath spontaneously breaks the symmetry of the ALP potential, displacing the field to a new vacuum. The resulting back-reaction reduces the WIMP effective mass and delays its freeze-out. Depending on the strength of the coupling, symmetry restoration occurs via either a first-order phase transition (FOPT) or a crossover. In the FOPT regime, dark matter consists solely of WIMPs, whose delayed freeze-out permits annihilation cross sections up to two (five) orders of magnitude above the standard value for $s$-wave ($p$-wave) annihilation, while still yielding the correct relic density. In the crossover regime, both WIMP and ALP can contribute to dark matter. Remarkably, we find an \"ALP miracle\": a Planck-suppressed quadratic coupling yields an ALP abundance comparable to the observed dark matter density, largely independent of its initial displacement and mass.",

        "abstract": "The search for primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) is theoretically well motivated but remains observationally challenging. Tight constraints with low significance for the standard non-Gaussian shapes suggest that detection may lie beyond the reach of near-future experiments. However, tests of PNG are highly template-dependent. From a theory perspective, a whole new family of bispectrum shapes arise in the cosmological collider program, with distinct signatures of heavy particles during inflation. In this work, we provide a class of simplified collider templates for these particles that encompasses a broader range of masses, sound speeds, and interactions. We propose that, given the current state of observations, the most effective strategy to search for PNG signals is through orthogonalizing the collider templates, such that they are uncorrelated with the tightly constrained single field predictions. Using the Modal pipeline and Planck CMB data, we perform a systematic parameter scan of the collider templates with the most significant result reaching $2.4\\sigma$ for spin-0, after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect; indicative results for spin-1 and spin-2 peak near 2$\\sigma$. These results indicate that, with refined collider templates and improved data analysis strategies, there are credible prospects with forthcoming observations to detect PNG and also rule out single field inflation.",

The data clearly separate the relativistic broad line from the underlying continuum and from narrow emission and absorption features in the Fe band. The unprecedented spectral resolution in the Fe K band clearly demonstrates that the flux excess can be attributed to a single, broad feature, as opposed to a superposition of previously unresolved narrow features. This broad feature can be best interpreted as emission consistent with an origin near the innermost stable circular orbit around a rapidly rotating black hole. By modeling the shape of the broad line, we find a black hole spin of $a\\simeq0.98$ and an inclination of the inner accretion disk of $\\theta\\simeq63^\\circ$. The spin is consistent with prior reflection studies, reaffirming the robustness of past spin measurements using the relativistic reflection method. The measured inclination provides reinforcing evidence of a disk-orbit misalignment in Cygnus X-1.

        "abstract": "In radio-interferometry, we recover an image from an incompletely sampled Fourier data. The de-facto standard algorithm, the Cotton-Schwab CLEAN, is iteratively switching between computing a deconvolution (minor loop) and subtracting the model from the visibilities (major loop). The next generation of radio interferometers is expected to deal with much higher data rates, image sizes and sensitivity, making an acceleration of current data processing algorithms necessary. We aim to achieve this by evaluating the potential of various well-known acceleration techniques in convex optimization to the major loop. For the present manuscript, we limit the scope to study these techniques only in the CLEAN framework. To this end, we identify CLEAN with a Newton scheme, and use this chain of arguments backwards to express Nesterov acceleration and conjugate gradient orthogonalization in the major and minor loop framework. The resulting algorithms are simple extensions of the traditional framework, but converge multiple times faster than traditional techniques, and reduce the residual significantly deeper. These improvements achieved by accelerating the major loop are competitive to well-known improvements by replacing the minor loop with more advanced algorithms, but at lower numerical cost. The best performance is achieved by combining these two developments.CLEAN remains among the fastest and most robust algorithms for imaging in radio interferometry, and can be easily extended to an almost an order of magnitude faster convergence speed and dynamic range. The procedure outlined in this manuscript is relatively straightforward and could be easily extended.",

        "abstract": "The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has identified several individual neutrino emitters associated with supermassive black hole accretion phenomena, including blazars, tidal disruption events, and, unexpectedly, Seyfert galaxies. A key open question is which types of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are most likely to be neutrino emitters. Here we show that high-confidence extragalactic neutrino emitters tend not only to have higher hard X-ray fluxes but also to be more variable in mid-infrared (MIR) than other AGNs in the \\textit{Swift} BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey. MIR variations effectively trace long-term fluctuations in AGN accretion disks and/or jets. In addition to the role of X-ray flux emphasized in previous studies, we speculate that long-term central engine fluctuations may also be critical for neutrino production. This hypothesis may inform IceCube neutrino-electromagnetic counterpart association studies and provide new insights into cosmic ray acceleration sites. First, the observed neutrinos are unlikely to originate from AGN host galaxies or from interactions between large-scale (dozens of parsecs) winds/outflows and the surrounding interstellar medium. Second, if neutrinos are produced in the X-ray corona, the corona should exhibit strong magnetic turbulence dissipation or magnetic reconnection whose rate changes substantially on timescales of years. Third, the relativistic jets of blazar neutrino emitters may be intrinsically unstable over years. Finally, if neutrinos are related to interactions between small-scale winds/outflows and torus clouds, such winds/outflows must be highly episodic.",

However, the observed FRB population is shaped by complex selection effects arising from instrument sensitivity, DM-dependent search efficiency, and FRB source population redshift-evolution. In this work, we quantify the impact of such observational and population selection effects on cosmological inference derived from the conditional distribution $p(\\mathrm{DM}_{\\mathrm{exgal}}|z)$. Using forward-modeled FRB population simulations, we explore progressively realistic survey scenarios incorporating redshift evolution, luminosity function, and instrument DM selection function. To enable rapid likelihood evaluations, we build a neural-network emulator for the variance in cosmic DM, $\\sigma^2[\\mathrm{DM}_{\\mathrm{cosmic}}(z)]$, trained on $5\\times10^4$ baryonification halo-model simulations, achieving $\\leq4\\%$ accuracy up to $z=4$. We demonstrate that while redshift and DM-dependent selection effects substantially alter the joint distribution $p(\\mathrm{DM},z)$, they have a negligible impact on the conditional distribution $p(\\mathrm{DM}_{\\mathrm{exgal}}|z)$ for current sample sizes. The parameter biases are $\\lesssim0.8\\sigma$ for $10^2$ FRBs, indicating that conditional analyses are robust for present surveys.

We measure CO emission sizes for 37 disks with bright CO J=3-2 emission (S/N > 10 on the integrated flux; out of the 83 disks with CO detections), finding that the median radius containing 90% of the flux is ~84 au, with radii spanning from 23 up to 243 au. We report a correlation between the 12CO brightness temperatures and stellar luminosities, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.6, and we use it to prove that the 12CO optically thick emission layer primarily emanates from a region below the super-heated dust, which is optically thin to the stellar irradiation. Moreover, we derive 33 CO emission surface height profiles, finding a median aspect ratio  ~ 0.16 in a range from ~0.01 up to ~0.45 over the sample. Finally, we comment on the multiple systems in our sample, of which only some were already known.

We include such a suppression in the form of transfer functions and derive general formulas for the hot-spot core temperature and radius. Applying our results to illustrative scenarios, we find that in the vanilla memory burden scenario in which the evaporation rate and Hawking temperature are exactly constant, the hot-spot temperature is substantially lowered.

        "abstract": "It is understood in a general sense that turbulent fluid motion below the shock front in a core-collapse supernova stiffens the effective equation of state of the fluid and aids in the revival of the explosion. However, when one wishes to be precise and quantify the amount of turbulence in a supernova simulation, one immediately encounters the problem that turbulence is difficult to define and measure. Using the 3D magnetohydrodynamic code ELEPHANT, we study how different definitions of turbulence change one's conclusions about the amount of turbulence in a supernova and the extent to which it helps the explosion. We find that, while all the definitions of turbulence we use lead to a qualitatively similar growth pattern over time of the turbulent kinetic energy in the gain region, the total amount of turbulent kinetic energy, and especially the ratios of turbulent to total kinetic energy, distinguish them. Some of the definitions appear to indicate turbulence is a necessary contributor to the explosion, and others indicate it is not. The different definitions also produce turbulence maps with different correlations with maps of the enstrophy, a quantity widely regarded as also indicating the presence of turbulence. We also compute the turbulent adiabatic index and observe that in regions of low enstrophy, this quantity is sensitive to the definition used. As a consequence, the effective adiabatic index depends upon the method used to measure the turbulence and thus alter one's conclusions regarding the impact of turbulence within the supernova.",

X-ray catalogues with hundreds of thousands of detections are treasure troves of such sources, which require innovative methods to identify these black holes.

Our proposed architecture, the Keck Optical Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics System (KOLA), combines multiple laser guide stars (LGS) and deformable mirrors to enable wide-field correction across a 60 arcsecond field of view. Simulations were conducted using the open-source Multi-Threaded Adaptive Optics Simulator (MAOS), which we validated against on-sky data for the current Keck I adaptive optics system. We evaluated KOLA performance across a range of design parameters and report key point spread function metrics, including Strehl ratio, full width at half maximum, and encircled energy radius. Example science-driven requirements include resolving black hole spheres of influence, probing crowded stellar fields, and imaging protoplanetary disks. Trade studies on actuator count and laser guide star configuration help inform future design decisions. We present a nominal KOLA design (10 LGS, 3 tip-tilt natural guide stars (TTNGS), and 3600 actuators on the adaptive secondary mirror). Performance simulations show a 15 mas angular resolution with a Strehl ratio of 34% at 652 nm on-axis.

        "abstract": "Tests of general relativity (GR) with gravitational waves (GWs) introduce additional deviation parameters in the waveform model. The enlarged parameter space makes inference computationally costly, which has so far limited systematic, large-scale studies that are essential to quantify degeneracies, check effect of waveform systematics, and assess robustness across non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise effects. The need is even sharper for next-generation (XG) observatories where signals are longer, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are higher, and likelihood evaluations increase substantially. We address this by applying relative binning to the TIGER framework for parameterized tests of GR. Relative binning replaces dense frequency evaluations with evaluations on adaptively chosen frequency bins, reducing the cost per likelihood call while preserving posterior accuracy. Using simulated binary black hole signals, we demonstrate unbiased recovery for GR-consistent cases and targeted non-GR deviations, and we map how bin resolution controls accuracy, with fine binning primarily required for the $-1$ post-Newtonian term. A high-SNR simulated signal at next-generation sensitivity further shows accurate recovery with tight posteriors. Applied to GW150914 and GW250114, both single and multi-parameter TIGER analyses finish within a day, yielding deviation bounds consistent with GR at 90\\% credibility and in agreement with previous results. Across analyses, the method reduces wall time by factors of $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(100)$, depending on frequency range and binning, without degrading parameter estimation accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Accurate and precise measurements of neutron star radii provide invaluable information about the cold, dense matter in neutron star cores. Analyses of synthetic X-ray pulse waveform data similar to the data obtained from non-accreting neutron stars using the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) have indicated that mass and radius estimates made using such data are robust against some systematic errors that may be made when modeling these data, such as errors in the assumed pattern of the thermal X-ray emission from the surface of these stars. A potentially important but so far unexplored source of systematic error is misparameterization of unmodulated background components, which can bias the inferred radius, particularly when data from different telescopes are used in the analysis. In this study, we investigate the effects of the background model on radius estimates by jointly analyzing synthetic NICER and XMM-Newton data, using the $\\sim 2.1~M_\\odot$ pulsar PSR~J0740$+$6620 as a prototypical example. Our analysis shows that even if the background assumed in the model underestimates the actual background by a factor of more than five, the resulting shift of the radius posterior from the true value of the radius corresponds to only $\\sim1\\sigma$. In all the cases we examined, the Bayesian evidence for the correct background model is greater than for the incorrect background model. These results add to the evidence that analyses of NICER-like data provide accurate measurements of neutron star radii when the statistical sampling is thorough and the model fits the data well.",

The Figure of Merit (FoM) matrix served as the final criterion for assessing fitting performance. The results show that the G factor of the CC dataset increases linearly with redshift z, whereas the G factor of the BAO dataset follows a cubic relationship. Further analysis indicates that the FoM value for datasets with high G factors is significantly higher than that for datasets with low G factors, thereby validating the G factor's effectiveness as a tool for assessing observational data quality and reducing parameter degeneracy. This suggests that the G factor may serve as a diagnostic tool and selection criterion for optimizing observational datasets in future research.",

A notable fraction of these have well-defined power laws with $\\nu^{-2.1}$ exponential turnovers, indicative of free-free thermal absorption along the line-of-site. We analyse a sample of 63 PSRs with such spectral shapes, compiled from four previously published studies, to investigate their statistical properties. We normalise each spectrum to a characteristic frequency and flux density of its own, facilitating a consistent treatment across the four sub-samples. We show these two fitted parameters are correlated by a power law, with its slope reflecting the median spectral index ($\\alpha\\sim -2.0$) of PSR emission. We found that the turnover frequencies in our sample are typically high, clustering around 558 MHz, implying notably high emission measures ($EM \\sim 10^{5}$ pc cm$^{-6}$) for an inferred thermal absorbing medium with electron temperature of $T_{\\mathrm{e}}=8000$ K. Moreover, by combining these $EM$ with dispersion measures (DM) derived from pulse time delays, we break the degeneracy between electron density and path length of the absorbers. This reveals a discrete near-in population of absorbers characterised by small sizes ($L \\sim 0.1\\,\\text{pc}$) and high electron densities $(n_{\\mathrm{e}} \\sim 10^{3}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3} $)), which exhibit a clear size-density anticorrelation reminiscent of that observed in Galactic and extragalactic H$_\\rm{II}$ regions.",

At the heart of JEM-EUSO's technology is an ultra-fast, highly sensitive UV camera capable of detecting EASs in the atmosphere with exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. A dedicated Cherenkov camera has been developed to evaluate the viability of the Earth-skimming technique from high altitudes. Fluorescence and Cherenkov detectors can be used together to create a hybrid detection surface. This innovative approach enables detailed studies of fluorescence and Cherenkov light from cosmic ray and neutrino interactions. The JEM-EUSO technology will allow for observations from space to significantly increase the exposure to these rare phenomena. The collaboration employs a multi-platform strategy with ground-based experiments like EUSO-TA calibrating detection systems and validating models, and balloon-borne missions such as EUSO-Balloon and EUSO-SPB1/SPB2 demonstrating observations from the stratosphere and testing technologies. Space-based missions, particularly Mini-EUSO on the ISS, have provided valuable data on UV backgrounds, TLEs, and meteoroids, as well as demonstrating the potential for future space-based detection. While we are developing a cross-platform methodology, we are ultimately moving towards space-based measurements.

        "abstract": "We present the results of deep near-infrared imaging of the recently discovered helium star pulsar binary J1928$+$1815 situated in the Galactic plane. Our observations did not achieve significant detections, providing limiting magnitudes of J=23.7 and H=22.2, which are both 2.4\\,magnitudes deeper than the expected J and H magnitudes for a modeled stripped helium star with a mass of 1\\,$\\rm M_{\\odot}$ after extinction. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of more significant extinction and the exact evolutionary status of the supposed helium star is uncertain, by comparing J1928$+$1815 with other pulsar binaries, we propose a natural alternative solution: that J1928$+$1815 is a heavyweight black widow system with a massive ablated white dwarf. Due to the pulsar's relatively high spin-down power and short orbital separation, the irradiation heating timescale is uniquely shorter than the cooling timescale for the WD companion. As a result, the WD effectively boils, with its outer layers expanding, overfilling the Roche lobe and producing low-density binary-scale haze opaque in the radio band. If this interpretation is correct, J1928$+$1815 would represent a new category distinct from canonical lightweight black widow systems. Radio eclipses can occur in pulsar binaries across a wider range of WD companion masses than previously thought. Therefore, they do not serve as a definitive indicator of a helium star without its direct detection. We contend that a spectroscopic identification remains the smoking gun for its existence. Given the crowding in this field, an \\textit{HST} imaging in the near-infrared band would provide even better constraints.",

This paper presents Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 spectral time series data for three variable L/T transition brown dwarfs and compares the findings to the highly variable benchmark object 2MASS J2139. All four targets reveal significant brightness variability between 1.1 to 1.65 micron but show a difference in wavelength dependence of the variability amplitude. Three of our targets do not show significant decrease in variability amplitude in the 1.4 $\\mu$m water absorption band commonly found in previous studies of L/T transition brown dwarfs. Additionally, at least two brown dwarfs have irregular-shaped, non-sinusoidal light curves. We create heterogeneous atmospheric models by linearly combining SONORA Diamondback model spectra, comparing them with the observations, and identifying the optimal effective temperature, cloud opacity, and cloud coverage for each object. Comparisons between the observed and model color-magnitude variations that trace both spectral windows and molecular features reveal that the early- T dwarfs likely possess heterogeneous clouds. The three T dwarfs show different trends in the same color-magnitude space which suggests secondary mechanisms driving their spectral variability.

As opposed to the recently studied case of solids, rotation plays a more important role in the present two-superfluids model. The associated energy density does not dilute away but scales as that of anisotropy and affects the total equation of state.

        "abstract": "Data from ground-based gravitational wave detectors are often contaminated by non-Gaussian instrumental artifacts or detector noise transients. Unbiased source property estimation relies on the ability to correctly identify and characterize these artifacts and remove them if necessary. To this end, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration has implemented candidate vetting for all significant candidates to identify the presence of artifacts and assess the need for mitigation. The current candidate vetting process requires human experts to identify the frequency ranges and the time windows associated with any data quality issues present. Differences in judgment between human experts may cause inconsistency, making results difficult to reproduce across gravitational wave events. We present GSpyNetTreeS, an extension to GSpyNetTree based on the You Only Look Once algorithm, for the automatic detection, classification, and time-frequency localization of detector noise transients. As a proof of concept, we tested GSpyNetTreeS's performance on the data collected by the LIGO detectors during the third observing run for gravitational waves as well as common detector glitch classes included in GSpyNetTree: Blip, Low frequency blip, Low frequency line and Scratchy. We also demonstrated that GSpyNetTreeS is capable of accurately identifying common glitch classes and capturing the frequency and time information associated with detected detector noise transients, establishing its potential as an automatic event validation tool for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's observing runs.",

        "abstract": "Variability studies of the broad emission lines of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and quasars show stochastic radial velocity variations (i.e., fluctuations in the centroid of the line), 'jitter', on timescales of weeks to months. This jitter may be intrinsic as the broad-line emitting region (BLR) reverberates from the AGN continuum. There are also coordinated variations in the width of the broad emission lines and the luminosity of the central source ('breathing' or 'anti-breathing') which remain unexplained. These can be used as a tool for testing models of the BLR. We have constructed a pipeline to simulate a disk-like BLR geometry that reverberates in response to various chosen continuum light curves and produce synthetic emission line profiles. These profiles can then be characterized by measured shape parameters (centroid velocity shift, velocity dispersion, and Pearson skewness coefficient) and compared to observed time series of those same parameters. We have found that through our pipeline, we can recreate the velocity jitter at similar variations found in observations. The computational tools presented in this paper will also be applicable to case studies of quasars observed under the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Black Hole Mapper reverberation mapping program. This paper is the first in a series of papers -- in this paper, we present the model and pipeline, and in future papers, we will present applications.",

        "abstract": "Deep-learning methods are becoming increasingly important in gravitational-wave data analysis, yet their performance often relies on large training datasets and models whose internal representations are difficult to interpret. Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) offers a complementary approach: it performs well in scarce-data regimes and yields physically interpretable representations of gravitational-wave morphology. Here we present CLAWDIA (Comprehensive Library for the Analysis of Waves via Dictionary-based Algorithms), an open-source Python framework that integrates SDL-based denoising and classification under realistic detector noise. We systematise previously isolated SDL workflows into a unified, modular environment with a consistent, user-friendly interface. The current release provides several time-domain denoising strategies based on LASSO-regularised sparse coding and a classifier based on Low-Rank Shared Dictionary Learning. A companion toolbox, GWADAMA, supports dataset construction and realistic conditioning of real and simulated interferometer data. We demonstrate CLAWDIA's performance by denoising the signal from binary neutron star event GW170817 and by classifying families of instrumental glitches from LIGO's third observing run, highlighting robustness at low signal-to-noise ratios. CLAWDIA is intended as a community-driven, interoperable library extensible to additional tasks, including detection and parameter estimation.",

These techniques rely on a clear understanding of the rotational motion of the debris targets, which is challenging to constrain from unresolved imaging.

We present four observations of the Ajisai satellite taken with SuperWASP in August of 2019, where high cadence photometry was extracted from streaked images as a part of a larger survey of Low Earth Orbit. We develop an MCMC-driven method to determine the spin-state of Ajisai by comparing the alignment between a map of modelled mirror positions and a novel derived map of surface reflectivity. We generally find good agreement within the expectation and uncertainties set by empirical models and our determined spin-state solutions align the surface reflectivity map and modelled mirror location well. Our results show that streak photometry can be used to recover the spin-axis and rotation period of fast-spinning objects such as Ajisai using modest ground-based instrumentation, making it readily scalable to a wider range of targets and observatories.",

Although a dozen X-ray sources are found within the UHE emission site, careful analysis shows that they are unlikely to produce the observed UHE emission. The most likely particle accelerator is pulsar J1740+1000 which if offset by 13' north of the UHE source but appears to be connected to it by an extended feature seen in X-rays. For a plausible pulsar distance of 1.2 kpc, 1LHAASO J1740+0948u must be located about 5 pc away which requires rapid transport of electrons along the feature to avoid radiative losses. This poses several challenges for standard pulsar theory. Firstly, being produced $\\lesssim$ 10 kyrs ago, particles must have been accelerated to the energy corresponding to a large fraction of the pulsar's full potential drop across the polar cap. Secondly, due to the lack of TeV emission extension toward the pulsar, particles must be accumulating in the UHE region. In this context, we discuss two possible scenarios: a tail filled with pulsar wind and confined by the bow-shock due to the fast pulsar's motion and an ISM filament filled by the most energetic pulsar wind particles escaping from the apex of the bow-shock.",

In the case of rapidly spinning black holes, up to $40\\%$ of the rest-mass energy of accreting matter can be released, far exceeding the efficiency of nuclear fusion. In this work, we investigate magnetized particle motion and relativistic accretion processes around a decoupled hairy black hole via extended geometric deformation. The developed geometry involves two hairy parameters that preserve the horizon structure with the additional feature of the fulfillment of weak energy conditions outside the event horizon. We provide the foundation with necessary formalism for magnetized particle motion around a decoupled black hole. The effective potential and innermost stable circular orbits are then derived, which demonstrate a significant reduction of the radius of the latter quantity under the hairy parameters for the magnetized particle. Afterwards, we obtain exact analytical expressions for radial velocity profiles, mass accretion rates, and a few others which reveal improved energy efficiency and emissivity as compared to the standard black hole. Furthermore, the decoupling parameter shows strong influence on oscillations, accretion presenting fantastic agreement between analytical predictions and numerical simulations, and thus offering noticeable observational signatures for future gravitational wave and X-ray astronomy.",

For the first time, we extend coherence and covariance studies into the hard X-ray band up to 150 keV. We detect a clear drop in coherence above 30 keV on both short- and long-timescales relative to the 2-10 keV reference band. To investigate the origin of the coherent variability, we simultaneously fit the short- and long-timescale covariances and the time-averaged spectra with a Comptonization model. Surprisingly, the electron temperature associated with long-timescale variability is significantly higher than that on short timescales. Moreover, the temperature on long timescales remains relatively constant throughout the hard state, whereas the short-timescale temperature evolves with X-ray luminosity. We attribute the drop in coherence to multiple sources of seed photons, i.e., the blackbody and synchrotron photons. The independence between these two photon fields leads to the drop in coherence. To explain the lower electron temperature on short timescales, we propose a two-Comptonization framework in which short-timescale variability arises from a vertically extended central region, while long-timescale variability originates at larger radii. The elevated geometry of the inner region leads to illumination primarily by cooler outer-disk photons, yielding a lower electron temperature. In this case, the evolution of the height of the elevated region could explain the evolution of the electron temperature associated with the coherent variability throughout the hard state.",

        "abstract": "The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observatory is a future L3 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) to detect gravitational waves, set to launch in 2035. The detector constellation will conduct interferometry to picometer stability over an unprecedented arm length of 2.5 million km. In this paper, we present the development and testing results for the Zerodur interferometer (ZIFO), an optical demonstrator built to validate critical technology for the test setup of the interferometric core of LISA. Optical path length stability measurements on the ZIFO demonstrate successful reduction of bench noise to maintain the 10 pm/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ specification across the 1 mHz to 1 Hz frequency band. We also identify and characterize dominant noise sources from phasemeters and correlations of beam tilt into the path length that were observed during the test campaign.",

We conducted a standard periodicity search on these data as well as a single pulse search at a range of dispersion measures. We found no convincing candidate signals, and we calculate flux density, luminosity, and single pulse fluence limits from these observations. The derived luminosity limits are comparable to the luminosities of three young, energetic pulsars (the Crab pulsar, PSR B0540$-$69, and PSR J0537$-$6910), and so we cannot rule out the existence of a pulsar in SNR 1987A with a similar radio luminosity.",

        "abstract": "A novel mechanism to produce a cosmic network of fundamental superstrings based on a time-varying string tension has been recently proposed. It has been found that fundamental superstrings can grow in a kinating background driven by the rolling of the volume modulus of Type IIB string compactifications towards the minimum of its potential. In this talk, I will generalise this analysis using dynamical systems techniques. First, I will analyse the cosmological growth of strings with a field-dependent tension in a Universe filled with a perfect fluid, finding a growth region in the phase space of this system. This machinery is then applied to both fundamental superstrings and effective strings obtained from wrapping $p$-branes on $(p-1)$- dimensional cycles. I will show how cosmological growth can be achieved in both cases not only in kinating backgrounds, but also in scaling fixed points. This talk is based on arXiv:2502.14953.",

        "abstract": "Blazars, a highly variable Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) subclass, provide a unique opportunity to explore the physical processes within their relativistic jets and emission regions. In this study, we investigate the multiwavelength variability of the blazar TON 599, a Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ), with a particular emphasis on its emission line behavior. We focus on the Mg II $\\lambda$2798 {\\AA} emission line, a key tracer of the ionized gas in the broad-line region (BLR), and its role in jet-induced variability. In addition to optical emission lines, we analyze gamma-rays (0.1-300 GeV), X-rays (0.2-10 keV), optical continuum ($\\lambda$3000 {\\AA}), optical polarization, and millimeter-wavelength light curves. Three cross-correlation methods are employed to investigate temporal relationships between the emission line and continuum across various wavelengths. Using the Non-Thermal Dominance (NTD) parameter, our analysis confirms that synchrotron emission dominates the continuum during active states, highlighting the jet's primary role in the observed variability. The Mg II emission line exhibits quasi-simultaneous variability with the optical continuum, suggesting photoionization driven by the jet's non-thermal radiation. Additionally, the minimal time lag between gamma-ray and optical/near-ultraviolet emissions supports a synchrotron self-Compton origin for the most variable component of the gamma-ray emission. These findings highlight the importance of emission line variability and multiwavelength observations in constraining the interaction between jets and the BLR in blazars. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of AGN emission mechanisms and the complex interplay between jets and their surrounding environments.",

        "abstract": "We present a comprehensive analysis of Solar Cycle 25 aimed at precisely constraining the interval of its activity maximum using multiple observational parameters: sunspot number (SSN), Wolf number, the 10.7 cm solar radio flux (F10.7), the occurrence rate and speed of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), the statistics of X-ray flares, and the reversal of the global magnetic field. A percentile-based classification of the adjusted F10.7 flux (EPH scale) is introduced, which allows us to identify the maximum-activity interval as August 2024 to January 2025. This period coincides with the reversal of the solar polar fields and is characterized by enhanced eruptive activity, including more than 190 M-class and 19 X-class flares (including an X6.3 flare on 10 December 2024) and multiple CMEs with speeds exceeding 2000 km/s. In the second part of the study we investigate solar rotation during this cycle using an independent observing campaign conducted in April 2025 in San Jose, Costa Rica, with privately owned telescopes in white light and in the H alpha line. Photometric techniques and active-region tracking yield mean synodic angular velocities of 12.8 +/- 2.8 deg/day in the northern hemisphere and 13.38 +/- 0.54 deg/day in the southern hemisphere, corresponding to sidereal periods of 22.78 and 21.77 days, respectively. Complementary SWPC-NOAA sunspot-region data provide synodic periods between 21.19 and 25.74 days, consistent with classical differential-rotation measurements. Linear velocities derived from SDO images span from about 872 km/h to more than 7400 km/h, depending on latitude and date.",

        "abstract": "We present a statistical census of bright, star-forming satellite galaxies around Milky Way (MW) analogs using the first data release of the Merian Survey. Our sample consists of 393 MW analogs with stellar masses $10^{10.5} < M_{\\star, \\rm host} < 10^{10.9} M_\\odot$ at redshifts $0.07 < z < 0.09$, all central galaxies of their own dark matter halos. Using photometric selection -- including magnitude, color, angular size, photometric redshift, and size-mass cuts -- we identify 793 satellite candidates around these 393 hosts. Our selection leverages two medium-band filters targeting H$\\alpha$ and [O \\textsc{iii}] emission, enabling a nearly complete sample of star-forming, Magellanic Clouds-like satellites with $M_{\\star, \\rm sat} \\gtrsim 10^{8} M_\\odot$. We find that $\\sim80\\%$ of hosts have 0-3 massive satellites, and $13\\pm4\\%$ have two satellites (similar to the MW). Satellite abundance correlates with total stellar mass, and we provide significantly improved statistics for the most massive satellites at $\\log_{10}[M_{\\star, \\rm sat}/M_{\\odot}] \\gtrsim 10$. The completeness-corrected radial distribution is less centrally concentrated than an NFW profile. In contrast, the Milky Way satellites are more centrally concentrated than the 50\\% richest Merian systems, but are broadly consistent with the 50\\% most centrally concentrated Merian systems. Our results highlight the power of medium-band photometry for satellite identification and provide a key benchmark for studying satellite quenching, environmental effects, and hierarchical galaxy formation.",

In this work, we utilize more than 17 years of $\\textit{Fermi}$-LAT data to search for gamma-ray emission from this subhalo. We identify a tentative excess in the region with ambiguous origin. Adopting a conservative strategy, we retain this excess without modeling additional astrophysical components, treating it instead as unmodeled background to derive upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section for the $b\\bar{b}$ and $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ channels. Despite this conservative treatment, the resulting limits remain stringent due to the exceptionally large $J$-factor. Subject to the dynamical confirmation of the subhalo, these constraints are potentially orders of magnitude stronger than those obtained from combined analyses of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and blind subhalo searches.",

Leveraging extensive public galaxy survey data at $z\\lesssim0.1$, we construct a new galaxy sample based on the availability of background QSOs with far-ultraviolet spectra from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). By combining this FUSE-galaxy sample with literature collections, we find that H I absorbers exhibit a clear inverse correlation between Doppler width and column density over nearly five orders of magnitude in $N_{\\rm HI}$, from $N_{\\rm HI} \\approx 10^{13}\\rm~{cm^{-2}}$ to $N_{\\rm HI} \\approx 10^{18}\\rm~{cm^{-2}}$, while O VI absorption follows a positive correlation across $N_{\\rm OVI}\\approx 3\\times10^{13}$-$10^{15}\\rm~{cm^{-2}}$. We develop a model framework to interpret these contrasting trends and show that H I absorbers are best described as systems of approximately constant total column density ($N_{\\rm H}$), whereas O VI traces regions of roughly constant spatial density ($n_{\\rm H}$ and $n_{\\rm OVI}$). Under the latter scenario, the observed $b_{\\rm OVI}$-$N_{\\rm OVI}$ relation maps directly to a velocity-size relation consistent with a Kolmogorov-like turbulent spectrum. Together, these findings reveal a coherent physical picture in which H I and O VI trace a continuous turbulent cascade spanning more than five orders of magnitude in spatial scale-from cool, photoionized clumps to warm, highly ionized halo gas--with accretion in the halo outskirts likely driving the turbulent energy injection that sustains the multiphase CGM.",

        "abstract": "Common envelope evolution is a critical but still poorly understood phase in binary evolution. It plays a key role in forming close binaries such as hot subdwarfs, double white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, and double neutron stars. However, its outcomes remain highly uncertain. Depending on the efficiency of envelope ejection, a system may either survive as a close binary or undergo a complete merger. In this work, we investigate the post merger evolution of systems where a CO WD mergers with the core of an AGB star. A grid of merger remnant models with various core and envelope masses is constructed. At the onset of evolution, the CO core contracts and undergoes off-center carbon ignition, producing an inwardly propagating carbon flame. For remnants with relatively low mass of CO core, the flame phase is followed by core contraction and subsequent H-shell burning. For more massive CO cores, the carbon flame reaches the center and is soon followed by off-center neon burning, which is expected to eventually lead to core-collapse supernovae. The merger remnants occupy nearly the same region on HR diagram as ordinary AGB or super-AGB stars, exhibiting similar surface properties. Although their surface abundance may differ slightly from those of normal AGB stars depending on the initial core and envelope masses, these differences are strongly reduced once mass-loss is taken into account. We suggest that some giant-like stars, including candidates for Thorne-Zytkow objects (e.g., HV 2112), might alternatively be explained as AGB-WD merger remnants.",

The new simulations can accordingly predict the abundances of gas- and ice-phase molecular species such as H_2O and CO_2 ice within individual molecular gas cloud of galaxies based on gas density and temperature, dust temperature (T_dust), elemental abundances (e.g., CHNOPS), UV radiation strength (F_UV), and cosmic ray ionisation rate (zeta_CR) within the clouds. Since this is the first of the series of papers, we describe the details of the new simulations and present the preliminary results focused on the spatial distributions of H_2O, CO, CO_2, and CH_3OH ice species in a disk galaxy similar to the Milky Way. We particularly discuss how T_dust and gas-phase elemental abundances can control the spatial distributions of the above molecules in galaxies.

        "abstract": "In recent years, ground- and space-based photometric surveys have characterized the rotational evolution of solar-like stars to an unprecedented level of detail. In this work we focus on the slow-rotator sequence, an emergent feature recognizable in the color-period diagram of Galactic open clusters. Understanding the evolution of this sequence is a promising avenue to formulate a robust rotation period-mass-age relation, which can be used to estimate stellar ages. Our model of the rotational evolution of stars on the slow-rotator sequence takes into account magnetized wind braking and the rotational decoupling between the radiative interior and the convective envelope. This decoupling naturally develops as the internal redistribution of angular momentum lags behind the loss of angular momentum at the stellar surface, and is parameterized in the model by a rotational coupling timescale. Using literature data on rotation and membership of stars in a selection of open clusters of age between 100 Myr and 4 Gyr, we constrain the mass dependence of the two competing processes of wind braking at the surface and angular momentum transport in the interior. Consistently with our previous findings, our best-fitting model requires a mass-dependent coupling timescale; this result is insensitive to the details of the wind braking model used. We show that the mass dependence of the coupling timescale follows a broken power-law in the entire solar-like mass range (0.4-1.25 Msun), with the exponent change occurring at ~ 0.6 Msun. At the same time, our approach can be used to infer semi-empirically the mass dependence of the wind braking model that best fits the observational constraints. Based on our findings, we propose a novel wind braking law with a particularly simple mass term, directly proportional to the moment of inertia of the convective envelope of the star.",

These targets exhibit visual magnitudes ranging from 8.0 to 12.0 mag, parallaxes between 0.11 and 1.74 mas, effective temperatures of 18,000 to 30,000 K, and luminosities from 1,500--38,000 $L_\\odot$, consistent with previously cataloged BCEP populations, thereby demonstrating the robustness of our classification criteria. Key findings include: (1) a significant detection disparity between SC and FFI datasets, with 30\\% of SC targets exceeding 18,000 K compared to only 0.7\\% in FFI, reflecting observational biases toward high-luminosity, hotter stars in SC data; (2) four samples near the red edge of the theoretical instability strip, exhibiting sparse pulsation modes that are important samples for testing pulsation models under low-mass, low-temperature conditions; and (3) spatial clustering within the Galactic disk ($|b| < 20^\\circ$), with two high-latitude outliers likely representing runaway stars ejected from disk environments. Our analysis underscores the critical role of space-based photometry in detecting low-amplitude pulsators and the transformative potential of multi-survey integration in the era of time-domain astronomy.

This observation-based correlation resulted to be in an overall very good agreement with that arising from the aforementioned predictions. Additionally, when the four analyzed properties are linked to the accretion groups of the Milky way to which the globular clusters are meant to be associated, I found kinematically cold and hot tidal tails pertaining to globular clusters distributed in all the considered accretion groups. This outcome could be an evidence that globular clusters form in galaxies within a wide variety of dark matter halos, with different masses and profiles.",

This is common practice in simulations of galaxy formation in which following the non-equilibrium abundances of additional elements is computationally expensive. We define the $\\mathrm{H}_2$ excess as the shift in density of the \\ion{H}{I}-$\\mathrm{H}_2$ transition in the reduced network compared to the full chemical network (30 elements). The strength of the $\\mathrm{H}_2$ excess generally increases both with temperature and metallicity, is largely independent of the radiation field strength, and persists across a large range of assumed shielding column densities. For warm gas, with $T\\approx1000~\\mathrm{K}$, the HI-$\\mathrm{H}_2$ transition is shifted by up to 1 dex to lower densities in primordial chemistry networks already for extremely low metallicities ($Z\\geq 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{Z}_{\\odot}$). We confirm our earlier findings that missing reactions with oxygen are largely responsible for this $\\mathrm{H}_2$ excess. A reduced chemical network of hydrogen, helium, and oxygen recovers the molecular hydrogen fractions from a full network and we therefore recommend to include destruction of molecular hydrogen by oxygen in a minimal chemical network for accurate molecular hydrogen abundances.",

Aims: The goal of the present investigation is the interpretation of recent JWST data of the low main sequence of 47 Tuc, in order to explore the stellar to sub-stellar transition, to derive the mass distribution of the individual sources and to disentangle stars from different populations.   Methods: Stellar evolution modelling of low-mass stars of metallicity [Fe/H]=-0.78 and oxygen content [O/Fe]=+0.4 and [O/Fe]=0 is used to simulate the evolution of the first and the second generation of the cluster. The comparison between the calculated sequences with the data points is used to characterize the individual objects, to split the different stellar components and to infer the current mass function of the cluster.   Results: The first generation of 47 Tuc harbours 45 % of the overall population of the cluster, the remaining 55 % making up the second generation. The transition from the stellar to the sub-stellar domain is found at $0.074 M_{\\odot}$ and $0.07 M_{\\odot}$ for the first and second generations, respectively. The mass function of both the stellar generations are consistent with a Kroupa-like profile down to $0.22 M_\\odot$.",

        "abstract": "We investigate how neutral-ion collisional damping modifies the spectral properties and energy partition of compressible MHD turbulence using a suite of 3D two-fluid simulations. By systematically varying the neutral-ion coupling strength and decomposing the turbulent velocity field into Alfv\\'en, slow, and fast modes, we quantify how each mode responds to the transition from strong to weak coupling. In the strong-coupling regime, the Alfv\\'en and slow modes follow nearly Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ spectra and dominate the kinetic energy budget, while fast modes exhibit a steeper spectrum and contribute $\\sim$10\\% of the total energy. As the coupling weakens and neutral-ion damping becomes significant, all mode spectra steepen, with the Alfv\\'en mode approaching a dissipation-dominated $k^{-4}$ spectrum. The slow-mode energy fraction increases substantially toward small scales, reaching up to $\\sim$70\\% near the damping scale, whereas the Alfv\\'en-mode fraction decreases correspondingly. In contrast, the fast-mode energy fraction remains largely insensitive to coupling strength. These results demonstrate that partial ionization not only steepens the turbulent spectra but also reshapes the mode energy distribution, enhancing the relative importance of the slow mode while suppressing Alfv\\'en mode in the damping regime. Our findings have important implications for turbulence-driven processes in the partially ionized interstellar medium, including cosmic-ray transport and acceleration.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic fields are found in many astrophysical objects, ranging from galaxy clusters to the interstellar medium of galaxies and magnetars. Strong magnetic fields are also observed in massive stars, but it is still unclear how they are generated. There are different theories for their origin: the magnetic fields could be fossil fields from star formation, they could be generated in dynamo processes during stellar evolution, or they could be generated during a merger of two stars. Here, we show how magnetic fields are generated in simulations of mergers of massive main-sequence stars, conducted with the 3D magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO. In these simulations, a $9\\,M_\\odot$ and a $8\\,M_\\odot$ main sequence star merge, whereby the more massive star transfers mass to the less massive one until it is finally disrupted, forming a core--disk structure. During the initial mass transfer, magnetic fields start to be amplified in the accretion stream, saturating after the disruption at an equipartition level. Correspondingly, the magnetic energy starts being present at small scales, growing to larger scales during the merger. During the merger, the magnetic pressure is much smaller than the gas pressure, thus the dynamical impact of the magnetic fields on the merger is small. After the merger, both are similar in some regions and the magnetic field shows a large-scale structure that is mostly toroidal and that is expected to be stable. Thus, our simulations show that magnetic fields in massive stars can originate from a merger of two main sequence stars.",

The residual noise between the model and the simulated Lya field has a nearly white (scale-and orientation-independent) power spectrum on quasi-linear scales, substantially simplifying its modeling compared to a purely perturbative description.

To remove systematics caused by stellar mass (M*) and star formation rate (SFR), we construct stacked spectra binned by redshift within fixed M* and SFR ranges, as well as across the full ranges. We find that the [OII]3727/Hb ratio drops by a factor of five from z~3 to 8 at fixed M* and SFR, in contrast to the nearly constant [OIII]5007/Hb ratio. We derive metallicities via the direct Te method using the [OIII]4363 line, and identify that high-z galaxies lie on the low-metallicity end of the anti-correlation between ionization parameter and metallicity at z~0. Photoionization modeling demonstrates that the redshift evolution, where metallicity decreases and ionization parameter increases, self-consistently explains the observed line ratios. We then examine the mass-metallicity (MZ) and fundamental (MZ-SFR) relations. Including additional galaxies at z~10-12, we find that the MZ relation monotonically decreases from z~3 to 10 at fixed M*, while the MZ-SFR relation shows a significant decline at z>8. Based on the ChemicalUniverseMachine model, this evolutionary trend can be explained by enhanced gas inflow (outflow) by a factor of ~5 (~1.7) at z>8.",

        "title": "NGDEEP: A New Non-Parametric Measure of Local Star-Formation and Attenuation at Cosmic Noon",
        "abstract": "We introduce a new non-parametric technique to quantify the spatially-resolved relationship between the local star-formation rate (SFR) and dust attenuation. We then apply it to 14 star-forming galaxies at $1.0<2.5$ using JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy from the NGDEEP survey. First, we construct spatially resolved ($\\sim$1~kpc per pixel) Balmer decrement ($H\\alpha/H\\beta$) maps of these galaxies and derive their corresponding dust attenuation and intrinsic SFR maps. We then rank-order the map pixels by attenuation and construct a cumulative distribution curve of the total SFR as a function of increasing attenuation. We define $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{10\\%}$, $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{50\\%}$, and $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{90\\%}$ as the dust attenuation levels behind which 10\\%, 50\\%, and 90\\% of the total integrated SFR is screened, respectively. These metrics quantify the probability that a given star-forming region lies behind a given level of attenuation. Across the full sample, 50\\% of the local star formation occurs behind an attenuation of 3.41 mag or higher ($\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{50\\%}$). This indicates that the bulk of star formation in these galaxies is significantly attenuated by dust. The value of $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{10\\%}$ equals 1.45 for the average profile, indicating that even the least attenuated star-forming regions are still highly attenuated. The globally measured attenuation more closely matches $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{10\\%}$ than $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{SFR}}_{50\\%}$. This suggests that the global value is weighted toward the least dust-obscured star-forming regions and significantly underestimates the typical attenuation a star-forming region encounters. Our results demonstrate a new approach for understanding the extremely dusty local conditions of the star-forming interstellar medium in SF galaxies at cosmic noon.",

        "abstract": "Red giants are increasingly used as stellar population tracers due to their well-understood evolution and the availability of asteroseismic observables. However, stellar binarity can alter observable properties and introduce strong biases. We aim to provide a holistic picture of the binary population and its evolution in the red giant phase by characterizing a sample of binaries hosting oscillating red giants from a combination of extensive asteroseismic, spectroscopic, and astrometric surveys. We investigate the binary properties of evolved stars in the APOKASC3 and APO-K2 catalogs, leveraging asteroseismic constraints and Gaia DR3 non-single-star solutions. We explore the mass distribution of red-giant binary systems and analyze the evolution of their binary fraction. For stars with M$\\leq$1.8M$_\\odot$, we find binary fractions $\\sim$31% and $\\sim$41% for oscillating and non-oscillating solar-like stars on the main-sequence (MS). By the power excess ($\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$) as luminosity proxy, we detect a binary attrition of $\\sim$69% and $\\sim$81% on the low- and high-luminosity red-giant branch (RGB) and an additional $\\sim$38% to the red clump (RC), with respect to the MS. Binaries hosting RC and secondary clump stars (2RC) stars are largely depleted at $P_\\mathrm{orb}\\lesssim$500 and $\\lesssim$200 days, respectively. Mass-dependent differences in binary fractions and orbital properties point to more substantial binary attrition for stars with M $\\leq$1.8 M$_\\odot$. The distinct mass distributions and the depletion of short-period binaries during the red-giant phase underscore the impact of stellar expansion and binary interactions on stellar evolution. RC systems with $P_\\mathrm{orb}\\lesssim$800 to 1,000 days are likely shaped by past interactions, such as mass transfer or loss, which can lead to significantly biased age estimates if not accounted for.",

        "abstract": "We present an approach to identifying and characterizing unresolved, very low mass spectral blend binaries composed of late-M, L, and T dwarfs using machine learning methodologies. We generated and evaluated a series of hierarchical random forest models to distinguish spectral blends from single very low-mass dwarfs, and to classify their primary and secondary components. Models were trained on a sample of single and synthesized binary templates generated from empirical spectra. We explored various aspects of the design of our models, and find that models trained on a full range of single and binary combinations have the best performance for identification and component classification. These models achieve binary identification recall and precision of $\\gtrsim$85%, median component classification errors of $\\lesssim$0.1 subtypes, and systematic classification uncertainties of $\\lesssim$1 subtype, outperforming index-based methods in terms of fidelity, range, and speed. Optimal performance is achieved for binaries composed of L and T dwarf primaries and late-L and T dwarf secondaries. When applied to the spectra of previously confirmed very low-mass binaries, model performance is degraded due to the prevalence of systems with similar component types, but remains high in the optimal performance range. We propose potential improvements to these models, which can be used to explore binary populations among the thousands to millions of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs anticipated with large-scale spectral surveys such as SPHEREx and Euclid.",

The observations were performed during a low state, permitting us for the first time to determine the contact points of the white dwarf. Using LCURVE we could determine its size, and hence mass, with a direct method and with unprecedented accuracy. We determined the mass of the white dwarf as 0.78 +- 0.02 Msun, the mass ratio Q= MWD / Msec = 4.59, and the orbital inclination i=87.4 +- 0.9. An extended warm region with a central temperature of ~33,000 K was observed in the u-band at the location of the previous high-state accretion spot. Weak accretion was ongoing in the low state that led to cyclotron emission that could best be studied with the r-band data. It has a diameter of only 3deg to 4deg and is located much closer to the binary meridian than the accretion-heated region studied in the u-band. The longitudinal shift of the two accretion regions is of order 30deg, due to early and late coupling of accreted matter onto the magnetic field lines in low and high accretion states, respectively. The low-state cyclotron-emitting region has a vertical extent of 0.005 - 0.016 Rwd, a value that seems to be correlated to the instantaneous accretion rate.",

It will provide binary fractions and orbital configurations of binary systems, and search for dormant black-hole binary candidates (OB+BH). Here we present projected rotational velocities (vsini) of all sources and, using the multiplicity properties presented in previous papers, we derive the vsini distributions of apparent single stars, single lined spectroscopic (SB1) binaries, and SB2 systems. We identify a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where rotational velocities decrease significantly; we interpret this feature as broadly corresponding to the terminal-age main sequence. The main sequence cohort is distinguished by a broad range of vsini values, but with a strong peak in the distribution in the range 30-60 km/s, close to the resolution limit of 30 km/s. Sources in this low vsini peak are distributed throughout the main sequence, and are also present in the SB1 sample, though less prominent than in the single star distribution. A preliminary analysis of the lowest vsini cohort, that includes SB1 systems, implies that roughly one third may be nitrogen rich and we speculate that this cohort is a mix of pristine single stars, long period binaries, and merger products. The SB2 systems appear to be mostly short period binaries in synchronous rotation and have vsini estimates distributed around a mean value of approximately 140 km/s . Higher vsini sources are also present in the single and SB1 systems, all of which have tail to higher vsini values, consistent with tidal and mass-transfer effects. The supergiants, with a few exceptions, have low vsini, the bulk of these systems being essentially unresolved at current spectral resolution.",

Their formation involves dust grain growth of many orders of magnitude and a myriad of processes operating at time scales from a few tens to millions of years. Thus, investigating the formation and evolution of young stellar objects (YSOs) is of great importance in modern astronomy. Addressing this goal requires overcoming long-standing challenges in characterizing multifaceted phenomena that span a broad range of astrophysical processes (from protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation to accretion dynamics and transient stellar events). Also, YSOs are complex systems that consist of several components: a central forming object, surrounded by a medium or disk from which the accretion process is at work, supersonic ejection of plasma in the form of collimated bipolar jets (which interact with the ambient medium through which they propagate) and all these components emit in a wide range of wavelengths. A facility capable of simultaneously tackling these diverse questions must deliver long-term, high-cadence spectroscopic monitoring of YSOs over time spans of at least a decade; especially because accretion/ejection processes in YSOs are characterized by a wide range of temporal variability: from short-term (hours-days) to long-term (months-years) variability due to rotation, accretion, magnetic activity, etc. Such a mission demands a spectroscopic platform considering a solid time-domain astronomy framework, providing repeated observations over wide fields and supporting multiple cadence strategies tailored to distinct scientific objectives.",

Aims. To perform a rigorous abundance analysis of the metal-rich bulge globular cluster NGC 6304, in order to determine its detailed chemical composition and identify multiple populations. Methods. We analyzed APOGEE-2 near-IR spectra of 27 giant members. The abundances of 17 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Ce) were derived using the BACCHUS code, using atmospheric parameters from both ASPCAP and photometry (Gaia and 2MASS). Results. We derived $[{\\rm Fe/H}] = -0.45\\pm0.05$ using the ASPCAP parameters, and $[{\\rm Fe/H}] = -0.45\\pm0.08$ when using photometric parameters, with no evidence of an intrinsic metallicity spread. NGC 6304 shows $[\\alpha/{\\rm Fe}]_{\\rm spec} = 0.24\\pm0.07$ and $[\\alpha/{\\rm Fe}]_{\\rm phot} = 0.23\\pm0.08$. We find a significant spread in $[{\\rm N/Fe}]$, with $\\sigma_{\\rm spec} = 0.54$ and $\\sigma_{\\rm phot} = 0.46$, along with a C-N anticorrelation. Furthermore, we detect a correlation of Ce with both N and Al, consistent with patterns observed in some metal-rich bulge globular clusters. Conclusions. We find a significant star-to-star variation in Na, but a minimal variation in O. The absence of the Mg-Al anticorrelation supports the evidence that the MgAl cycle is not active in globular clusters at high metallicity. The observed correlation between Ce and both N and Al suggests that the enrichment of these elements may be driven by asymptotic giant branch stars, positioning Ce as an element involved in multiple populations in metal-rich globular clusters. We find that abundances are consistent with those of bulge field stars of similar metallicity, suggesting a similar origin and chemical evolution.",

        "abstract": "We present a new three-parameter family of self-consistent equilibrium models for quasi-relaxed stellar systems that are subject to the combined action of external tides and rigid internal rotation. These models provide an idealised description of globular clusters that rotate asynchronously with respect to their orbital motion around a host galaxy. Model construction proceeds by extension of the truncated King models, using a newly defined asynchronicity parameter to couple the tidal and rotational perturbations. The method of matched asymptotic expansion is used to derive a global solution to the free boundary problem posed by the corresponding set of Poisson-Laplace equations. We explore the relevant parameter space and outline the intrinsic properties of the resulting models, both structural and kinematic. Their triaxial configuration, characterised by extension in the direction of the galactic centre and flattening toward the orbital plane, is found to depart further from spherical symmetry for larger values of the asynchronicity parameter. We hope that these simplified analytical models serve as useful tools for investigating the interplay of tidal and rotational effects, providing an equilibrium description that complements, and may serve as a basis for, more realistic numerical simulations.",

        "abstract": "Estimating stellar masses for billions of galaxies in upcoming surveys requires methods that are both accurate and computationally efficient. We present a new approach using symbolic regression trained on a simulation to derive simple, explicit mathematical expressions that estimate galaxy stellar masses from basic observables: photometry and redshift. Using a mock catalogue from the GALFORM semi-analytical model that reproduces the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS), we show that a linear combination of just four observables -- minimally processed $u$- and $i$- band magnitudes, observed $(g-r)$ colour, and redshift -- can recover stellar masses with accuracy comparable to traditional spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but with negligible computational cost. Our expressions can be evaluated instantaneously for millions of galaxies, making them ideal for next-generation surveys like LSST and Euclid. When observational errors are included, symbolic regression achieves a similar accuracy to deep neural networks while maintaining transparency. Validation against CIGALE SED fitting on PAUS data shows agreement within 0.13 dex for galaxies with $M_{*} > 10^8 M_{\\odot}$. We demonstrate that the stellar mass function can be recovered at $z < 0.5$, though with distortions at the extremes: the high-mass end is overestimated by a factor of $\\sim 3$ at $10^{11.5} h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$ due to scatter. Our approach offers a fast, transparent alternative to traditional methods without sacrificing accuracy for the bulk of the galaxy population.",

        "abstract": "We present a systematic comparison between the tidal secular evolution timescales predicted by the direct numerical method and those given by the commonly used semi-analytic prescriptions implemented in 1-D hydrostatic binary evolution codes. Our study focuses on binary systems with intermediate- to high-mass primaries ($M_1 = 5$-$50\\,M_\\odot$), companion masses between $1.4\\,M_\\odot$ and $10\\,M_\\odot$, and orbital periods ranging from 0.5 to 50 days. Before mass transfer, both approaches predict synchronization and orbital decay timescales that agree within $\\sim$2 orders of magnitude and typically exceed the stellar main sequence lifetime, implying negligible tidal impact on secular orbital evolution. However, the implied dissipation channels differ, and the differences become more pronounced once mass transfer begins. To test the theoretical predictions against observations, we apply both approaches to the well-characterized PSR J0045--7319 system, which has an orbital decay timescale of 0.5 Myr. The numerical solution reveals strong resonances with internal gravity waves, bringing the predicted orbital period change rate close to the observed value. In contrast, the semi-analytic prescriptions predict orbital decay timescales longer than the Hubble time. These results suggest that for population studies, modestly calibrated parameterized equations may suffice, but for individual systems, reliable interpretation requires direct numerical approaches.",

        "abstract": "The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics concept aims to map large areas with spectral coverage and sensitivities inaccessible to previous FIR space telescopes, covering 25-235um. We synthesise images representing a deep imaging survey, with realistic instrumental and confusion noise, reflecting the latest PRIMAger instrument specifications. We present a new Bayesian modelling approach XID+stepwise that exploits PRIMAger's hyperspectral imaging to derive self-consistent, informative flux priors by sequentially propagating constraints from short to long wavelengths. With Euclid-like prior source positions, this method recovers fluxes to within 20% to 0.2-0.7 mJy across 45-84 um, which correspond to factors of 1.3-3.4 fainter than the confusion limit. For the most confusion-dominated channels, accurate fluxes are measured to 0.9, 2.5, 7.6 and 14.8 mJy at 92, 126, 183 and 235 um, respectively, which are factors of 3-5 better than the confusion limit. Using a deeper Euclid-based prior catalogue and weak ancillary flux priors at 25 um yields further improvements, reaching up to a factor ~7 fainter than the confusion limit at 96 um. Additionally, we demonstrate that positional priors from blind source detection followed by deblending via XID+ enables PRIMAger to achieve sensitivity beyond the confusion limits using PRIMAger data alone. We show that IR-luminous galaxies at z~2 are robustly detected in a large fraction of the PRIMAger channels (>98% in 12 out of the 16 considered channels), providing dense sampling of the FIR SED even for sources several factors below the confusion limit. We explore the impact on our results for a range of systematic effects, including cirrus contamination, optical degradation, and calibration uncertainties. These findings indicate that confusion noise will not limit the key science from PRIMA extragalactic imaging surveys when employing XID+.",

Prior-driven deblending techniques require extensive fine-tuning and struggle to process large fields. This work aims to develop a fast, reliable deep-learning based deconvolution and denoising super-resolution (SR) technique. We employ a transformer neural network to improve the resolution of Herschel/SPIRE 500 $\\mu$m observations by a factor 4.5, using Spitzer/MIPS 24$\\mu$m and Herschel/SPIRE 250, 350, 500$\\mu$m images. Trained on SIDES and SHARK simulations, we injected instrumental noise into the input simulated images, while keeping the target images noise-free to enhance de-noising capabilities of our method.   We evaluated the performance on simulated test sets and real JCMT/SCUBA-2 450 $\\mu$m observations in the COSMOS field which have superior resolution compared to Herschel. Our SR method achieves an inference time of $1s/deg^2$ on consumer GPUs, much faster than traditional deblending techniques. Using the simulation test sets, we show that fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved image are accurate to within 5% for sources with an intrinsic flux $\\gtrsim$ 8 mJy, which is a substantial improvement compared to blind extraction on the native images. Astrometric error is low ($\\lesssim$ 1\" vs 12\" pixel scale). Reliability is $\\gtrsim$ 90% for sources $>$3 mJy and $>$90% of sources with intrinsic fluxes $\\gtrsim5$ mJy are recovered. Applied to real 500 $\\mu$m observations, fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved map agree well with SCUBA-2 measured fluxes for sources $\\geq$10 mJy. Our technique enables SR over hundreds of $deg^2$ without the need for fine-tuning, facilitating statistical analysis of DSFGs.",

In this work, we develop a pipeline to create a semantic search engine from completely unlabeled image data. Our method leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate descriptions for galaxy images, then contrastively aligns a pre-trained multimodal astronomy foundation model with these embedded descriptions to produce searchable embeddings at scale. We find that current VLMs provide descriptions that are sufficiently informative to train a semantic search model that outperforms direct image similarity search. Our model, AION-Search, achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on finding rare phenomena despite training on randomly selected images with no deliberate curation for rare cases. Furthermore, we introduce a VLM-based re-ranking method that nearly doubles the recall for our most challenging targets in the top-100 results. For the first time, AION-Search enables flexible semantic search scalable to 140 million galaxy images, enabling discovery from previously infeasible searches. More broadly, our work provides an approach for making large, unlabeled scientific image archives semantically searchable, expanding data exploration capabilities in fields from Earth observation to microscopy.

The model couples the XSTAR code, which treats atomic processes, with the Feautrier method for solving the radiative transfer equation. A key feature of DAO is the incorporation of a high-temperature corrected cross section and an exact redistribution function to accurately treat Compton scattering. Furthermore, the model accommodates arbitrary illuminating spectra, enabling applications across diverse physical conditions. We investigate the spectral dependence on key physical parameters and benchmark the results against the widely used reflionx and xillver codes.",

The 2$_{0,2}$-1$_{0,1}$ line at 127 GHz was mapped with 20\" resolution ($\\sim$2800 au), revealing extended CH2NH emission across the core. The peak line intensity coincides with the well-known c-C3H2 peak, while the integrated intensity peaks between the HNCO and dust continuum peaks due to broader linewidths in the latter region. Column densities of CH2NH are $\\sim$(0.5-1.4$\\times$)10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, corresponding to fractional abundances of $5\\times10^{-11}$-$1\\times10^{-10}$, with a trend decreasing from the southern, carbon-chain rich region to the dust and HNCO peak in the north. Comparison with complementary molecular maps and the gas-grain chemical model of Sipil\\\"a et al. suggests that neutral-neutral gas-phase reactions and dissociative recombination dominate in the outer carbon-chain shell. This study demonstrates that CH2NH, a simple nitrogen- and carbon-bearing molecule previously detected with pointed observations in other cold cores, is present and spatially extended in the evolved pre-stellar core L1544. This indicates that prebiotic nitrogen-carbon chemistry continues efficiently up to the onset of gravitational collapse, providing key constraints for astrochemical models and the early stages of chemical complexity leading to amino acids.",

        "abstract": "Sun-like stars are known to host a paucity of brown dwarf companions at close separations. Direct imaging surveys of intermediate-mass stars have suggested that the brown dwarf desert may be fundamentally a feature in the mass ratio. Microlensing surveys provide a unique opportunity to investigate the nature of this desert around low mass stars, as microlensing hosts have typical masses of 0.05-0.8 $M_\\odot$. Here, we perform a statistical analysis of homogeneously selected binary-lens microlensing events in the literature, and identify a companion mass-ratio desert at $0.02\\lesssim q\\lesssim0.05$ and projected separations around 1-5 au. We derive a statistically significant truncation to the giant-planet mass-ratio distribution at $q\\simeq0.02$, above which the occurrence rate density drops by approximately an order of magnitude. Due to the possibility that the small number of detected companions in this desert orbit white dwarfs, this mass-ratio desert may be closer to being completely dry around main-sequence stars. Below this desert, we derive a giant-planet ($q>4\\times10^{-4}$) occurrence rate density of $5.8\\pm0.8$% per decade of projected separation. Our analysis furthers the hypothesis that the brown dwarf desert is fundamentally a feature in the mass ratio, separating distinct populations of planetary and non-planetary companions that are likely formed via core accretion and gravitational instability, respectively. The persistence of this desert across stellar types suggests that both gas-giant planets and sub-stellar companions form in a scale-invariant fashion, with planets growing to a maximum of approximately 2% their host masses.",

        "abstract": "Most discussion of charge-transfer-efficiency (CTE) losses involves the parallel transfer of charge in the y-direction down the chip columns (y-CTE). Serial charge-transfer efficiency (x-CTE) refers to the horizontal transer of charge. Serial CTE losses were first assessed in WFC3/UVIS in 2014 (WFC3/ISR 2014-02), where it was found that bright stars were shifted by roughly 0.0015 pixel away from the readout amplifier. Now that the WFC3/UVIS CCD has spent more than three times as long in space, imperfect serial CTE should have three times the impact on the images, so we revisit the effect and characterize serial CTE in a similar manner to our models for parallel-CTE by using a combination of warm pixels, cosmic rays, saturated stars, and overscan pixels. Overall, serial CTE has a much smaller impact on images than does parallel CTE. As of 2023, parallel CTE can have a roughly 5 percent impact on bright sources and a greater than 50 percent impact on faint sources, and serial CTE can have a roughly 1% impact on bright sources and a roughly 3 percent impact on fainter sources. The first few pixels in the serial CTE trails are much sharper than the parallel trails, but there is a very faint component to the serial trails that extends much farther than the parallel trails, even wrapping around to the next row. We develop a pixel-based model for the trapping and release of charge in the serial register and release a stand-alone beta-version of this pixel-based serial-CTE correction. Most images are not significantly impacted by the x-CTE effect, however HST users that require high-precision astrometry could benefit from this correction. At the very least, curious users can quantify its potential impact on their science.",

Despite its importance, the statistical properties of the turbulent fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection, which are essential for understanding how this energy conversion proceeds, remain poorly understood. Here, we employ large-scale 3D particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the turbulence characteristics of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection in a magnetically dominated plasma. We characterize their statistical properties by computing structure functions along different directions within the reconnection layer. We find that the square root of the second-order velocity structure function follows a power-law scaling with a slope near $\\sim1/3$ at intermediate to large scales, consistent with Kolmogorov-like turbulence, a behavior robust along the inflow, outflow, and guide-field directions. The square root of the second-order magnetic structure function consistently exhibits a steeper slope, in the range $\\sim 0.6 - 0.8$. The presence of a finite guide field does not systematically modify the slope of the velocity fluctuations, while it progressively steepens the scaling of the magnetic fluctuations in the guide-field and inflow directions. We also measure higher-order structure functions, which reveal strong magnetic intermittency along the outflow direction and weaker intermittency in the inflow and guide-field directions. In addition, the local anisotropies of both velocity and magnetic field fluctuations are greater for stronger guide fields. These results provide a first systematic characterization of the multiscale nature of turbulence in collisionless reconnection layers, with important implications for plasma heating and particle acceleration.",

These sBBHs can retain detectable eccentricities when they enter the sensitivity bands of low-frequency GW observatories. We study multiband GW observations of eccentric sBBHs that escape from GC models simulated with the MOCCA code, focusing on how low- and middle-frequency detectors can constrain their eccentricities and other parameters. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we generate ten realizations of cosmic sBBHs by combining the MOCCA sample with a cosmological model for GC formation and evolution. We then assess their detectability and the precision of parameter estimation. Our results show that LISA, Taiji, the LISA-Taiji network (LT), and AMIGO could detect $0.8\\pm0.7$, $11.6\\pm2.0$, $15.4\\pm2.7$, and $7.9\\pm1.3$ escaping sBBHs, respectively, over four years, while LT-AMIGO could detect $20.6\\pm3.0$ multiband sBBHs in the same period. LT and AMIGO can measure initial eccentricities with relative errors of approximately $10^{-6}-2\\times10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}-0.7$, respectively. Joint LT-AMIGO observations have a similar ability to estimate eccentricities as LT alone.",

We present the design and first results of the MeerKLASS On-the-Fly (OTF) continuum data, which exploits the visibilities recorded during fast, constant-elevation scans. This observing mode enables fast commensal imaging over several hundred of square degrees on a nightly basis.   We describe the OTF survey strategy and pipeline, focusing on handling challenges introduced by the current MeerKAT fixed-delay correlation observing mode, which causes decorrelation (smearing). We implement a correction scheme based on time-dependent phase rotation, direction-dependent PSF modeling, and wide-band faceted deconvolution with \\texttt{DDFacet}. Using UHF-band and pilot L-band data, we demonstrate the recovery of high-quality 2-second snapshot images and deep mosaics over hundreds of square degrees. After smearing correction we are able to achieve a resolution of $23.3$arcsec and $14$ arcsec with an rms sensitivity of $35 \\mu {\\rm Jy\\,beam}^{-1}$ and $ 33 \\mu {\\rm Jy\\,beam}^{-1}$ in the UHF and L-band respectively.

The continuum OTF data products will support diverse science goals, including galaxy and AGN evolution, diffuse cluster emission, large-scale structure and cosmology, rotation-measure synthesis, and transient searches.

These observations reveal previously unexplored properties of dual and lensed systems, key to understanding galaxy evolution, black hole mergers, and strong-lensing modeling. Targets were selected using the Gaia Multi-Peak (GMP) technique, which identifies pairs of point-like sources with separations below 0.8\" in the Gaia catalog. MUSE spatially resolved spectroscopy provides redshifts, ionization diagnostics, and absorption systems along the line of sight. We report results for 30 GMP-selected targets at z=0.5-3.5. All systems show at least two spatially resolved components. Nineteen objects are confirmed as AGN multiplets, including 6 dual AGN, 10 doubly-lensed quasars, and 3 quadruply-lensed systems, while the remaining 11 correspond to alignments with foreground stars. Among spectroscopically confirmed dual AGN in the literature, 24 pairs have separations below 7 kpc, and our sample accounts for 25% of them. We study dual and lensed AGN distributions as a function of redshift, magnitude, and projected separation, and find that bright systems (J<16.5) are dominated by lensed quasars, whereas the fraction of dual AGN increases at fainter magnitudes. This first-year sample demonstrates the high efficiency of GMP pre-selection combined with MUSE spectroscopy. The full program, targeting 150 systems, will enable statistical studies of dual AGN incidence and detailed constraints on mass distribution in strong-lensing galaxies.",

This complexity is dissipated, together with that of the overlying pre-existing fields, through dynamic events such as flares. A period of stable \"ordinary\" coronal heating ensues, before the concentrated fields are dissipated through interactions with the surrounding environment. The evolution of coronal abundances can be explained by the First Ionisation Potential (FIP) effect operating within this framework. We extend the discussion from magnetic activity on timescales of active region lifetimes (months), to the solar cycle (years), and stellar evolution (eons).

        "abstract": "We construct a combined model to incorporate neutron star (NS) mass measurements with electromagnetic mass-radius constraints and gravitational-wave observations using Bayesian inference. We use different mass distributions for three populations depending on the companion stars: double neutron stars, NS - white dwarfs, and low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). To observe the effects of different parametrizations, we use two equation of state (EoS) models: a piecewise polytrope and a fixed sound-speed model at high densities in combination with a low-density EoS. Our results show that the mass distributions of these NS populations are distinct and sensitive to the EoS prior choices. In addition, using a uniform prior on the observable NS maximum mass rather than a nuisance parameter from the unknown high-density EoS, shifts the posterior maximum mass to larger values. For polytrope-like EoSs, the maximum mass posterior shifts from $M_\\mathrm{max}=2.09_{-0.07}^{+0.18} M_\\odot$ to $2.15_{-0.10}^{+0.19} M_\\odot$ at the 90% confidence level.

Three of five previously considered links are revisited here: extended features in M22 in BC48, Te-11 in 483, and AT Cnc in 1645. We aim to develop a procedure to check whether these links are credible. Literal translations of the Chinese texts, historically based arguments, and close readings are combined with astrophysics, (peak brightness, decay time estimate, shell age expansion model calculation, etc.). (a) Nandou's second star, near which the BC48 `guest star' was reported, is identified as tau Sgr, not lambda Sgr, far from the M22 location. A nova in M22 would peak at only m=6.4 \\pm 1.4 mag, and thus a description as a `blue-white' `melon' does not fit; it was likely a comet. (b) The imprecise position (`Shen['s] east') of the `guest star' in 483, its extended (dipper-like) radiance, and the context speak for a bolide. Considering the new (larger) Gaia distance and small extinction towards Te-11 (outside a cloud), its bi-polar morphology and current expansion velocity point to a planetary nebula; as a nova, the shell expansion age is 1100-2000 yr from detailed supersonic expansion calculations. (c) Most certainly, Mars was meant when the source for 1645 reported `a large star entered Yugui'; the verb implies motion. AT Cnc lies neither in Yugui's asterism box nor in the eponymous lunar mansion range. The fluid drag expansion age of AT Cancri's ejecta is 128-631 yr. All three exact ages are unsubstantiated.

In strongly magnetized turbulence energy imbalances can arise, quantified by the so-called residual energy: $E_r~=~(E_{kin}~ - ~E_{mag})$; $E_{kin}$ and $E_{mag}$ stand for the volume-averaged kinetic and magnetic energy, respectively. Numerical simulations of incompressible turbulence yield $E_r  $ 0. Differences arise in the cascade of $E_r$ between the two regimes. We explore the properties of $E_r$ in weakly compressible MHD turbulence in the presence of an initially strong (guide) magnetic field. We study the influence of different driving mechanisms and field strengths on the cascade of $E_r$. We run a suite of direct numerical simulations with the PENCIL code. All simulations are maintained through forcing in a quasi-static regime with sonic Mach numbers close to 0.1. We solely change the Alfv\\'en Mach number, or equivalently the plasma beta ($\\beta$) of the simulations. We drive turbulence by either injecting velocity or magnetic fluctuations at large scales and study the power spectra of kinetic, magnetic, density, and $E_r$. Magnetically-driven simulations show locally imbalanced Alfv\\'enic fluctuations and a $\\propto k^{-3/2}$ cascade, consistent with the dynamic alignment theory. Kinetically-driven simulations give rise to a $\\propto k^{-1}$ scaling, consistent with interactions between Alfv\\'en waves scattered by density inhomogeneities -- a hallmark of reflection-driven turbulence.

Our knowledge of the dust properties is nevertheless incomplete, especially regarding the dense star-forming clouds. The aim is to study dust evolution in the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 (OMC-3) and how uncertainty regarding dust properties affects estimates of the radiation field and the cloud mass. We constructed three-dimensional radiative transfer (RT) models to fit the far-infrared (FIR) observations of dust emission in the OMC-3 field and used near-infrared (NIR) extinction measurements as additional constraints. We examined fits to the dense star-forming filaments and to the surrounding cloud, including some tests with spatial dust property variations.The 160-250 $\\mu$m observations of dust emission could be fitted moderately well with any of the dust models tested, but few models are consistent with the measured NIR extinction. The best match to observations is found with dust models such as the THEMIS model of large porous grains, with or without ice mantles, and with mean grain sizes up to ~ 0.3$\\mu$m. The flattening of the NIR extinction curve excludes larger grain sizes, except possibly in the central ridge. Compared to models of lower column density clouds, the results were relatively insensitive to the line-of-sight (LOS) cloud size and the spectral shape of the heating radiation field. In addition, the effect of embedded stars remained very localised in OMC-3. The results suggest that the dust in the OMC-3 region is evolved with a grain of average size $a$=0.1-0.3 $\\mu$m, potentially with ice mantles.",

We identify flares in 24 sources in M31, 5 in M81, and 26 in Cen~A; several display recurrent events. Flare durations span from tens of seconds to a few $10^{4}$ s, with peak luminosities of $10^{37}$-$10^{40}\\ \\mathrm{erg\\ s^{-1}}$ and low flare duty cycles of $4.9\\times10^{-6}$-$3.5\\times10^{-2}$. Dipping events are found in 8 sources in M31, 1 in M81, and 5 in Cen A, including two repeaters. On multi-epoch baselines, the standard deviation of the source luminosity correlates linearly with the mean luminosity, with a coefficient of 0.49 (M31), 0.30 (M81), and 0.67 (Cen A), indicating galaxy-to-galaxy diversity. No statistically significant periodic signals are detected in M81 or Cen A, which, along with several periodic signals previously found among the M31 sources, can be understood considering a joint effect of our detection sensitivity and intrinsic distributions of the orbital period and X-ray luminosity of LMXBs. The ensemble of short-duty-cycle flares, a mix of recurrent and isolated dips, and galaxy-dependent rms--flux factor, supports a picture in which stochastic accretion-rate fluctuations modulate luminosity on $\\sim$10-$10^{4}$ s. Conducted at known distances and across distinct host environments, this extragalactic survey provides uniform flare/dip samples and rms-flux scalings for bulge-dominated fields, offering empirical constraints for accretion physics and illustrating the promise of timing analyses in external galaxies using the Chandra archive.",

The central millimeter peak MM1 coincides with the centimeter source VLA 2, has a complex molecular spectrum, and is identified as a hot molecular core. Molecular emission of SiO and CH3CN in the vicinity of MM1 reveals kinematics consistent with wide-angle outflow structures and a possible rotating disk in the source. VLA sources 1A, 1B, and 3 are lacking compact millimeter counterparts and trace shocked regions where the outflow interacts with the surrounding material. In particular, VLA 1A, the site of H2O maser super flares, is interpreted as a shock interface that exhibits developed turbulent movements seen in the SiO molecular line. The observed turbulence creates conditions required for H2O maser action, directly linking the nature of VLA 1A to the origin of the H2O maser super flares.",

The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field.

The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\\mathbf{g}|\\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.",

        "abstract": "The merger rate of primordial black hole (PBH) binaries can be used to understand the source population of the merging black hole binaries observable through gravitational-waves (GWs) and also to constrain the possible contribution of PBHs to dark matter. In the literature, the PBH merger rate is calculated analytically, assuming that PBH binaries stay in isolation (i.e. are unperturbed) and evolve solely via GW emission during their entire lifetime. However, if some or all of dark matter consists of PBHs, then as cosmic structures grow, PBH binaries and single PBHs fall inside dark matter halos. In those halos, the PBH binaries' interactions with their environment significantly affect the subsequent evolution of their orbital properties. In this paper, we present a numerical framework that accurately calculates the total PBH merger rate by combining the evolution of isolated binaries outside halos with the dynamics of binaries inside halos. In our work we have found that the isolated binary channel is suppressed at low redshifts and dynamical interactions in halos reshape the merger rate evolution with time, accelerating some mergers. At redshifts of $\\lesssim 2$ the total merger rate is a factor of $\\simeq 50 \\%$ higher than the results assuming that all PBH binaries effectively stay unperturbed until their merger. Our simulations provide a definitive calculation on the total PBH merger rates, that are currently being probed and constrained from gravitational-wave observations.

        "abstract": "Sulfur chemistry is fundamental to understanding the structure, cloud formation, and atmospheric composition of Venus and Venus-like exoplanets. However, many key reactions involving ground- and excited-state sulfur species remain poorly characterized, and current photochemical models rely on networks that lack accurate kinetic data under high-temperature, high-CO2 conditions. We compute kinetic parameters for reactions of ground-state S(3P) and excited-state S(1D) with CO2 under Venus-like conditions. These reactions form SO(3Sigma), SO(1Delta), and CO. The potential energy surfaces reveal intermediates, and temperature-dependent rate coefficients are obtained using a master-equation approach based on the chemically significant eigenvalue method. NASA 7-term polynomial coefficients are also derived for ground- and excited-state S and SO for consistent use in photochemical models. Incorporating these data into the one-dimensional photochemical model XODIAC shows that these reactions exert only a minor influence above 60 km in the Venus atmosphere due to competing pathways. The model agrees with observations for most sulfur-bearing species except S3 and S4. Introducing a 1 ppm near-surface atomic sulfur mixing ratio, representing a possible deep-atmosphere or surface source or accounting for missing sulfur processes, increases S3 and S4 by 1-2 orders of magnitude and improves agreement with measurements. For exo-Venus analogs with stratospheric isotherms and strong stellar irradiation, the new reactions significantly modify the vertical profiles of major sulfur species above 30 km and enhance S(1D) and SO(1Delta) more strongly than in scenarios with only isotherms or only irradiation. These results underscore the importance of accurate excited-state sulfur kinetics and the need for updated reaction networks when modeling Venus and exo-Venus atmospheres.",

        "abstract": "Shear flows, ubiquitous in space and astrophysical plasmas, can accelerate particles through turbulence excited by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We present the first numerical study of particle acceleration in non-relativistic, magnetized, and purely shear-driven turbulence that includes full particle backreaction. Using two-dimensional MHD-PIC simulations with an initially uniform flow-aligned magnetic field and external stirring force, we demonstrate that sustained particle acceleration requires continuously driven turbulence, whereas freely decaying turbulence rapidly depletes its energy reservoirs and halts the acceleration. The acceleration mechanism operates through the systematic distortion of gyro-orbits by turbulent electric fields: acceleration phases extend the particle trajectory along the electric force, increasing the energy gain, while deceleration phases shorten the trajectory, reducing the energy loss. This asymmetry produces net energy gain despite stochastic fluctuations, with the mean energy change scaling quadratically with shear velocity, characteristic of second-order Fermi acceleration. Initially monoenergetic particles develop substantial non-thermal tails after the turbulence onset. For particles repeatedly crossing shear layers, their energization follows geometric Brownian motion with weak systematic drift, yielding a log-normal distribution. High-energy particles exhibit pitch-angle anisotropy, becoming preferentially perpendicular to the flow-aligned magnetic field as their gyroradii exceed the turbulent layer width. These results establish shear-driven turbulence as a viable particle acceleration mechanism, providing a general model for particle energization in shear flows.",

The method combines $E$ and $B$ modes with inverse-variance weights, to yield an unbiased reconstruction of $m(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ to first order. We study the ability of future Stage IV surveys to obtain an unbiased reconstruction of the $m$-bias in differing scenarios, considering differing bias morphologies, and characteristic scales, as well as differing metrics to quantify the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed map. Considering an $m$ pattern repeating on $\\sim 1^\\circ\\times1^\\circ$ sky patches, as might be the case for an $m$ field caused by focal-plane systematics. With a Euclid-like redshift distribution, we find that $\\sim5\\%$ rms variations in $m$-bias may be detected at the 20$\\sigma$ level, after stacking between $\\sim400$ and $\\sim1000$ patches (rising to between $\\sim2800$ and $\\sim7600$ for $1\\%$ rms variations, data volumes that are becoming available with upcoming surveys), depending on the morphology of the $m$ pattern. We show that these results are robust against the cosmological model assumed in the reconstruction, as well as the presence of intrinsic alignments or baryonic effects, and that the method shows no spurious response to additive ($c-$) bias. These results demonstrate that percent-level, spatially-varying $m-$bias can be detected at high significance, enabling diagnosis and mitigation in the Stage IV weak lensing era.",

Yet, current radio-interferometric pipelines utilize only a small fraction of hardware peak performance, typically 4-14%, due to memory and I/O bottlenecks, resulting in poor energy efficiency and high operational and carbon costs. Progress is further limited by the absence of standardised metrics and fidelity tolerances, preventing principled hardware-software co-design and rigorous exploration of quality-efficiency trade-offs. We introduce astroCAMP, a framework for guiding the co-design of next-generation imaging pipelines and sustainable HPC architectures that maximise scientific return within SKA's operational and environmental limits. astroCAMP provides: (1) a unified, extensible metric suite covering scientific fidelity, computational performance, sustainability, and lifecycle economics; (2) standardised SKA-representative datasets and reference outputs enabling reproducible benchmarking across CPUs, GPUs, and emerging accelerators; and (3) a multi-objective co-design formulation linking scientific-quality constraints to time-, energy-, carbon-to-solution, and total cost of ownership. We release datasets, benchmarking results, and a reproducibility kit, and evaluate co-design metrics for WSClean and IDG on an AMD EPYC 9334 processor and an NVIDIA H100 GPU. Further, we illustrate the use of astroCAMP for heterogeneous CPU-FPGA design-space exploration, and its potential to facilitate the identification of Pareto-optimal operating points for SKA-scale imaging deployments.

However, the rapid fading of their afterglows and the scarcity of spectroscopic measurements make photometric classification crucial for timely high-redshift identification. We present an ensemble machine learning framework for redshift classification of GRBs based solely on their optical plateau and prompt emission properties. Our dataset comprises 171 long GRBs observed by the Swift UVOT and more than 450 ground-based telescopes. The analysis pipeline integrates robust statistical techniques, including M-estimator outlier rejection, multivariate imputation using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator feature selection, followed by a SuperLearner ensemble combining parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric algorithms. The optimal model, trained on raw optical data with outlier removal at a redshift threshold of z equals 2.0, achieves a true positive rate of 74 percent and an area under the curve of 0.84, maintaining balanced generalization between training and test sets. At higher thresholds, such as z equals 3.0, the classifier sustains strong discriminative power with an area under the curve of 0.88. Validation on an independent GRB sample yields 97 percent overall accuracy, perfect specificity, and an ensemble area under the curve of 0.93. Compared to previous prompt- and X-ray-based classifiers, our optical framework offers enhanced sensitivity to high-redshift events, improved robustness against data incompleteness, and greater applicability to ground-based follow-up. We also publicly release a web application that enables real-time redshift classification, facilitating rapid identification of candidate high-redshift GRBs for cosmological studies.",

We test this interpretation by performing a non-parametric exploration of the minimally coupled, luminal Horndeski subclass known as kinetic gravity braiding (KGB). Using mochi_class and its manifestly stable effective field theory (EFT) basis implementation, we efficiently scan a broad class of models in which the EFT functions are allowed to vary freely in time, while enforcing the absence of ghost and gradient instabilities from the outset. We identify a set of KGB models that realize phantom crossing and remain broadly consistent with current probes of the background and linear large-scale structure, including CMB temperature and lensing power spectra, redshift-space distortions, cosmic shear, and the cross-correlation between galaxies and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Our results demonstrate that viable phantom-crossing solutions exist without conformal coupling, motivating future full Bayesian analyses of this model class with non-parametric EFT priors.",

We describe the field evolution both for one barotropic fluid as well as two collisionally coupled barotropic fluids with different density profiles using the anelastic approximation and the Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the evolution in three dimensions. In the one-fluid case, a single fluid describes the motion of the charged particles. In the two-fluid model, the neutral fluid is coupled to the electrically conductive fluid by collisions, the latter being dragged by the magnetic field. In this model, both fluids have distinct density profiles. This forces them to move at slightly different velocities, resulting in a relative motion between the two barotropic fluids -- ambipolar diffusion. We develop a code based on Dedalus and study the evolution of simple poloidal dipolar and toroidal magnetic fields. Previous 2D studies found that poloidal magnetic fields evolve towards a stable Grad-Shafranov equilibrium. In our 3D simulations we find an instability of the two-fluid system similar to the one in the barotropic fluid system. After the instability saturates, a highly non-linear Lorentz force introduces small-scale fluid motion that leads to turbulence, development of a cascade and significant, non-axially symmetric changes in the magnetic field configuration. Fluid viscosity plays an essential role in regularizing the small-scale fluid motion, providing an energy drain.",

        "abstract": "Modern wide-field time-domain surveys facilitate the study of transient, variable and moving phenomena by conducting image differencing and relaying alerts to their communities. Machine learning tools have been used on data from these surveys and their precursors for more than a decade, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which make predictions directly from input images, saw particularly broad adoption through the 2010s. Since then, continually rapid advances in computer vision have transformed the standard practices around using such models. It is now commonplace to use standardized architectures pre-trained on large corpora of everyday images (e.g., ImageNet). In contrast, time-domain astronomy studies still typically design custom CNN architectures and train them from scratch. Here, we explore the affects of adopting various pre-training regimens and standardized model architectures on the performance of alert classification. We find that the resulting models match or outperform a custom, specialized CNN like what is typically used for filtering alerts. Moreover, our results show that pre-training on galaxy images from Galaxy Zoo tends to yield better performance than pre-training on ImageNet or training from scratch. We observe that the design of standardized architectures are much better optimized than the custom CNN baseline, requiring significantly less time and memory for inference despite having more trainable parameters. On the eve of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time and other image-differencing surveys, these findings advocate for a paradigm shift in the creation of vision models for alerts, demonstrating that greater performance and efficiency, in time and in data, can be achieved by adopting the latest practices from the computer vision field.",

Previous simulations have focused nearly exclusively on thick accretion disks, appropriate for studying stellar binaries, and have found encouraging agreement with observations thereof. We present herein the first systematic study of eccentric binary systems accreting from thin disks, focusing on binary orbital evolution. Our main results are that (1) thinner disk not only drive binaries to rapidly inspiral, but also excite binary eccentricities at much higher rates; (2) while thick disks may drive binaries to a stable fixed point of $e\\approx0.425$, thinner disks pump binary eccentricities to $e\\gtrsim0.6$; (3) the range of near-zero eccentricities that are damped towards zero depends on both disk thickness and viscosity, thinner disks and those with $\\alpha$ viscosities driving binaries towards circularity over a much narrower range of eccentricities. These differences follow largely from the effects of pressure support on accretion streams and shocks within the inner regions of the accretion flow. Our results suggest that accreting binary black holes should have high eccentricities well into the frequency range probed by pulsar timing arrays and space-based gravitational wave interferometers, affecting the spectrum and isotropy of the gravitational wave background. Our results also suggest that circumbinary disks may play an important role in shaping the orbits of close binary stars, but much less so those of wider binaries.",

In this work, we quantify this multimessenger promise using Bayesian inference of many realizations of simulated PTA data, while adopting a model for the SMBHBs that has been successfully applied to the 15-year data set of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). Our analyses of 200 realistic, simulated NANOGrav data sets show that there is a greater than 50\\% chance of reducing the prior uncertainty in the SMBHB hardening rate by more than 50\\%, and in the SMBHB evolutionary lifetime by 25--75\\%. Additionally, there is an 88\\% chance that PTA data can reduce the prior uncertainty in the characteristic mass variable of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) by 25--50\\%. For $M_{\\text{BH}}$--$M_{\\text{Bulge}}$ parameters (in a model without redshift evolution) and the overall normalization parameter of the GSMF, PTA data can provide only marginal information gain beyond the constraints from electromagnetic observations. Our work delineates the domains over which electromagnetic and gravitational-wave data constrain the demographics and dynamics of the supermassive black-hole binary population, offering a clearer picture of the impact of population multi-messenger astrophysics probes with PTAs.",

        "abstract": "MAXI J1957+032 is an accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar that shows brief, recurrent outbursts in an ultra-compact ~1 h orbit. We characterise the 2025 outburst using X-ray timing and spectroscopy from XMM-Newton and Swift (and a late-time NuSTAR observation), together with contemporaneous optical photometry from LCO, and compare the spin frequency with the 2022 outburst. Timing searches detect coherent pulsations at ~313.6 Hz with no measurable frequency derivative during the XMM-Newton exposure. Relative to its 2022 outburst, we measure a long-term spin-down of ~-2x10^-14 Hz s^-1, consistent with magnetic-dipole braking in quiescence. The pulse profile is nearly sinusoidal, with significant power at the fundamental, second, and fifth harmonics; the fractional amplitude decreases with increasing flux and shows soft lags up to a few keV. The 0.5-10 keV spectrum is well described by absorbed thermal Comptonisation (photon index ~2.4) plus a cool blackbody (kT ~0.23 keV) consistent with emission from a surface hotspot; no reflection or Fe-line features are detected. Requiring R_m \\leq R_co implies B_s ~(0.5-3)x10^8 G for d=(5 \\pm 2) kpc and {\\xi}=0.3-0.5, below the upper limit from the secular spin-down (B_p \\leq 10^9 G), possibly indicating a mildly leaky propeller. The optical emission lies on the neutron-star branch of the L_OIR-L_X relation, consistent with reprocessing in a compact disc. The optical SEDs are broadly flat, while an early red excess suggests a transient jet contribution during the initial hard X-ray phase; an optical peak delayed relative to the X-rays may trace an outward-propagating heating front and rapid disc evolution in these short-lived outbursts.",

In this paper, we develop self-consistent leptonic, hadronic, and leptohadronic models that reproduce both the observed spectrum and morphology of the source. Purely leptonic models are energetically more favorable yet they require rather specific morphological assumptions. The gamma-ray morphology of the source can be better explained within a hadronic scenario based on the identification of cold gas structures spatially correlated with the observed gamma-ray emission. However, a purely hadronic model for the source emission requires a substantial energy reservoir in protons and fails to reproduce the extended X-ray emission recently detected by XRISM. We show that emission including a combination of leptonic and hadronic components can reproduce both the spectral and morphological properties of the source. We provide predictions for the X-ray and neutrino spectra of~the~nebula that can discriminate the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the overall source signal.",

Accretion solutions that involve the formation of shocks are particularly intriguing, as they are expected to naturally produce observable variability features. However, despite their theoretical significance, time-dependent studies exploring the stability and evolution of such shocked solutions remain relatively scarce. To address this gap, we perform simulations of transonic accretion flows around a black hole in ideal magneto-hydrodynamic framework. Our simulations are initialized using boundary conditions derived from semi-analytical hydrodynamical models, allowing us to explore the stability of these flows under varying magnetic field strengths. The presence of magnetic fields modifies the dynamics of the accretion flow through magnetic pressure, and the resulting force imbalance induces oscillations in the position of shock front. Our results show that variations in the emitted luminosity arising from shock oscillations appear as quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), a characteristic feature commonly observed in accreting black holes. We find that the QPO frequency is determined by the radial position of the shock front: oscillations occurring closer to the black hole produce frequencies of tens of hertz, whereas shocks located farther out yield sub-hertz frequencies",

In this work, we model the disk formation following the debris stream self-intersection in a TDE. We track the multi-band emission using three-dimensional, frequency-integrated and multi-group radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We find a more circularized disk forms about 24 days following the initial stream-stream collision, after the mass fallback rate peaks and once the debris stream density decreases. Despite the absence of a circularized disk at early times, various shocks and the asymmetric photosphere are sufficient to drive a wide range of optical-to-X-ray ratios and soft-X-ray variability. We find that with strong apsidal precession, the first light is from the stream-stream collision. It launches an optically-thick outflow, but only produces modest prompt emission. The subsequent optical and ultraviolet (UV) light curve rise is mainly powered by shocks in the turbulent accretion flow close to the black hole. The optical-UV luminosity peaks roughly when the disk forms and shock-driven outflows subside. The disk is optically and geometrically thick, extending well beyond the circularization radius. Radiation pressure clears the polar region and leaves optically-thin channels. We obtain the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) directly from multi-group simulations with 16-20 frequency groups. The SED has a black body component that peaks in the extreme UV. The soft X-ray component either resembles a thermal tail, or can be described by a shallower power law associated with bulk Compton scattering. The blackbody parameters are broadly consistent with observed optical TDEs and vary weakly with viewing angle. In contrast, soft X-ray emission is highly angle-dependent.",

The coupling of these modes to the radiative interior is yet to be discussed. We aim to understand the dependence of the modes on the uniformly rotating subadiabatic region below the convection zone, and whether this leads to measurable changes at the surface. We used the Dedalus code to compute the linear eigenmodes in the inertial frequency range in a setup including both the convection zone and the radiative interior down to $0.5 R_\\odot$. We imposed free-surface boundary conditions at both radial boundaries. For comparison, we also computed the eigenmodes in a setup restricted to the convection zone. We find that the inclusion of the radiative zone only slightly modifies the frequencies and the eigenfunctions at the surface, excluding some modes with significant radial motions (high-frequency retrograde and prograde columnar modes). On the other hand, most modes penetrate significantly into the overshooting layer below the convection zone, which significantly reduces the growth rate of the modes and distorts their eigenfunctions near the base of the convection zone. Furthermore, the uniformly rotating subadiabatic radiative zone supports oscillations due to Rossby modes of all possible spherical harmonics and radial nodes. In particular, when the nearest inertial mode in frequency space lies within around 10 nHz and shares the same north-south symmetry, these Rossby modes evolve into mixed modes characterized by significant motions within both the radiative and convection zones. However, such mixed modes have a large mode mass in the radiative interior and thus will be difficult to excite stochastically by convection.",

Current research on this uncertainty primarily focuses on hadronic interaction models, the dominant source of muon production.

A robust heuristic technique has been developed to estimate the contribution of these interactions to the total number of muons over a wide range of extensive air shower parameters (including primary particle type, energy, and slant atmospheric depth) and photonuclear interaction models, with an absolute percentage error on the order of $10\\%$ in the estimated number of muons.

The RPM ensures \\emph{structureless test particles} and attributes precession to geodesic motion alone. Here, we refine the RPM by incorporating the internal structure of rotating test bodies, while preserving the test particle approximation (TPA), and propose a \\emph{macroscopic precession model} (MPM) by means of the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations, applied to a Schwarzschild background, which introduces 1) a shift in the Keplerian frequency and 2) an \\emph{effective spin correction} to the radial epicyclic frequency that, once the spin tensor is modeled, reproduces a quasi-Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) correction. We apply the MPM to eight neutron star low mass X-ray binaries (NS-LMXBs), performing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fits to twin kHz QPOs and find observational and statistical evidence in favor of precise power law spin reconstructions. Further, our model accurately predicts the $3:2$ frequency clustering, the disk boundaries and the NS masses. From the MPM model, we thus conclude that complexity of QPOs can be fully-described including the test particle internal structure.",

        "abstract": "The closure phase, the sum of the three Fourier phases in a telescope triangle, is an important tool in astronomical interferometry, helping to reconstruct the geometries of the observed objects. While already established in amplitude interferometry, for the recently expanding field of intensity interferometers the closure phase enables recovering information of the interferometric phases that are otherwise inaccessible with this technique. To extract the (cosine of) the closure phase ($\\cos \\phi$) in intensity interferometry, third-order correlations between three simultaneously measuring telescopes have to be computed. As the signal-to-noise of such three-photon correlations is too small for current generation intensity interferometers, no third-order correlations of astrophysical targets have been recorded so far. In this paper we present the first measurements of third order correlation functions of two stellar systems, Nunki ($\\sigma $ Sgr) and Dschubba ($\\delta$ Sco), observed with the H.E.S.S. intensity interferometer in 2023. We show how to isolate the three-photon contribution term from the two-photon contributions, in order to access $\\cos \\phi$. For the observed stellar targets the sensitivity is not high enough to extract closure phase information. To demonstrate that the analysis works well we further extract $\\cos \\phi$ in a laboratory experiment, using the H.E.S.S. intensity interferometer and a pseudo-thermal light source.",

        "abstract": "The regularity/chaoticity of orbits of 45 globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius of 3.5 kpc, which are subject to the greatest influence of the elongated rotating bar, is analyzed. Various methods of analysis are used, namely, the methods of calculating the maximum characteristic Lyapunov exponents (MCLE), MEGNO (Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits), the Poincar\\'e section method, the frequency method based on calculating fundamental frequencies, and a new method is proposed based on calculating the orbit amplitude spectrum as a function of time and calculating the entropy of the amplitude spectrum as a measure of orbital chaos. Bimodality is found in the histogram of the distribution of positive Lyapunov exponents calculated in the classical version, without renormalizing the shadow orbit, which allows implementing a probabilistic method for GC classification, which is also a new approach. To construct the orbits of globular clusters, we used the gravitational potential model with a bar in the form of a triaxial ellipsoid. The following bar parameters were adopted: mass $10^{10} M_\\odot$, length of the semi-major axis 5 kpc, angle of rotation of the bar axis 25$^o$, rotation velocity 40 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. To form the 6D-phase space required for integrating the orbits, we used the most accurate astrometric data to date from the Gaia satellite (EDR3), as well as new refined average distances to globular clusters. Globular clusters with regular and chaotic dynamics were classified.",

        "abstract": "X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) emission from young stars plays a critical role in shaping the evolution of planetary atmospheres and the conditions for habitability. To assess the long-term impact of high-energy stellar radiation, it is essential to empirically trace how X-ray luminosities and spectral hardness evolve during the first ~<1 Gyr, when atmospheric loss and chemical processing are most active. This study extends the X-ray activity-mass-age analysis of <25 Myr stars by Getman et al. (2022) to ages up to 750 Myr, using Gaia-based cluster memberships, new Chandra observations of five rich open clusters (~45--100 Myr), and archival ROSAT and Chandra data for three older clusters (~220--750 Myr). We find a mass-dependent decay in X-ray luminosity: solar-mass stars undergo a far more rapid and sustained decline, accompanied by coronal softening and the disappearance of hot plasma by ~100 Myr, compared to their lower-mass siblings. These trends in solar-mass stars are likely linked to reduced magnetic dynamo efficiency and diminished ability to sustain large-scale, high-temperature coronal structures. The trends are significantly stronger than predicted by widely used XUV-rotation-age relations. The revised trends imply systematically lower rates of atmospheric mass loss and water photolysis, as well as altered ionization environments and chemical pathways relevant to the formation of prebiotic molecules, for planets in close orbits around solar analogs. These effects persist throughout at least the ~<750 Myr interval probed in this study.",

        "abstract": "High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM has revealed complex, non-monotonic velocity dispersion profiles in the Perseus cluster, pointing to a complex interplay between at least two physical drivers of motions caused by dynamical processes within the intracluster medium (ICM). To further explore this conclusion, we perform a suite of idealized, controlled simulations targeting the relative roles of merger-induced sloshing and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. Our models systematically isolate and combine these mechanisms to predict observable velocity profiles and X-ray line shapes, providing direct comparison to XRISM and Hitomi data. We find that neither sloshing nor AGN activity alone can reproduce the observed velocity dispersion profile; only their combined action matches the elevated dispersions both at the cluster core and outskirts. Power-spectrum analysis reveals distinct spatial signatures: sloshing generates large-scale coherent motions, while AGN feedback injects turbulence and broadens the velocity spectrum at small scales, especially in the core. By forward-modeling spectral line profiles, we show how these dynamics imprint unique observational signatures on X-ray emission. Our results underscore the necessity of accounting for both large-scale and small-scale drivers of gas motions in the ICM when interpreting high-resolution spectroscopic data, and provide guidance for the analysis of forthcoming XRISM observations.",

        "title": "On the use of polarized thermal emission to constrain cloud grain size and temperature structure of sub-stellar objects",
        "abstract": "Emission spectroscopy is an invaluable tool for probing the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and exoplanets, but interpretations based on flux spectra alone often suffer from degeneracies among temperature structure, chemical composition, and cloud properties. Thermal emission spectropolarimetry offers complementary sensitivity to these atmospheric characteristics. Previous studies have shown that linear polarization in fixed bandpasses depends on emission angle, temperature profile, and cloud scattering. In this study, we revisit these dependencies, emphasizing the wavelength-dependent effects that shape polarized spectra. We show that thermal polarization spectrum is primarily governed by: (1) a combination of temperature, temperature gradient, and wavelength; (2) cloud particle size; and (3) cloud optical thickness. Using the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code ARTES, we simulate polarization spectra from a modeled 1D atmosphere. We find that, for a fixed cloud optical thickness, the polarization exhibits peaks at size parameters near 0.2 and 1. However, the dependence on cloud optical thickness is more pronounced and tends to dominate the broadband polarization. We further show that much narrower polarization features in molecular absorption band, can in principle trace the local temperature gradient at the photosphere of each wavelength. Future low-resolution (resolving power around 100) spectropolarimeter operating at 1-2 micron with sensitivities of 1e-5 would be able to capture these polarization features, and may provide a new diagnostic for breaking degeneracies that commonly affect flux-only retrievals. This work represents an incremental step toward the challenging goal of jointly interpreting atmosphere from both intensity and polarization spectra.",

        "abstract": "We perform a comparative Bayesian analysis of fermionic and bosonic dark matter admixed neutron stars (DMANS) by incorporating a comprehensive set of theoretical, experimental, and astrophysical constraints. The hadronic matter equation of state (EoS) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field approach, constrained by chiral effective field theory ($\\chi$EFT) calculations at low densities, finite nuclei and heavy-ion collision data at intermediate densities, and neutron star (NS) observations at high densities. For the dark sector, we consider fermionic dark matter (FDM) interacting via a dark vector meson, and two bosonic dark matter models (BDM1 and BDM2) characterized by self-interacting scalar fields. Bayesian inference is employed to constrain the model parameters, including the dark matter mass, coupling strength, and dark matter fraction within NSs. Our analysis finds that all models yield consistent nuclear matter parameters, allowing a small dark matter fraction under 10%. The presence of dark matter slightly softens the EoS, leading to a modest reduction in NS mass, radius, and tidal deformability, though all models remain compatible with NICER and GW170817 observations. The log-evidence and likelihood analyses reveal no statistical preference among the FDM and BDM models, indicating that current astrophysical data cannot decisively distinguish between fermionic and bosonic dark matter scenarios. This study provides a unified statistical framework to constrain dark matter properties using NS observables.",

In this paper, we complete this general study of the cosmological history for a unit domain-wall number option of the DFSZ-type, dubbed VISH$\\nu$, by performing a detailed lattice-informed analysis of the reheating era. In doing so, we make inflationary and leptogenesis predictions more precise through estimates of the reheating temperature and the expansion history. The viable reheating scenarios, which at the same time satisfy strict conditions for naturalness (radiative stability), are also shown to respect dark radiation bounds. We also characterise the high-frequency spectrum of gravitational waves, and mention other phenomenological implications that distinguish VISH$\\nu$ from alternative proposals.",

Additionally, we explain the observed features in the Fairall~9 lag-spectrum and discuss the potential drivers behind them, based on our newly collected data from the Obserwatorium Cerro Murphy (OCM) telescope. We initiated a long-term, continuous AGN photometric monitoring program in 2024, titled 'Hubble constant constraints through AGN Light curve Observations' (HALO) using intermediate and broad band filters. Here, we present the first results from HALO, focusing on photometric light curves and continuum time-delay measurements for Fairall~9. To complement these observations and extend the wavelength coverage of the lag-spectrum, we also reanalyzed archival Swift light curves and spectroscopic data available in the literature. Using HALO and Swift light curves, we measured inter-band continuum delays to construct the lag-spectrum of Fairall~9. Excess lags appear in the $u$ and $U$ bands (Balmer continuum contamination) and in the $I$ band (Paschen jump/dust emission from the torus). Overall, the lag-spectrum deviates significantly from standard disk model predictions. We find that inter-band delays deviate from the power-law, $\\tau_{\\lambda} \\propto \\lambda^{\\beta}$ due to BLR scattering, reprocessing, and dust contributions at longer wavelengths. Power-law fits are therefore not well suited for characterizing the nature of the time delays.",

We show that this conclusion becomes much weaker in the presence of astrophysical foregrounds and strongly non-Gaussian primordial density perturbations, by studying how these phenomena affect the link between SIGWs and PBHs, and reevaluate LISA's sensitivity to asteroid-mass PBHs. In addition, we analyse the interplay between PBHs and SIGWs to gain further insights into the nature of primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that uncertainties in $f_{\\rm NL}$ can induce substantial uncertainties in the PBH abundance, which ultimately limits LISA's capacity to fully probe the asteroid-mass PBH DM window.",

Host properties are inferred through SED fitting with Prospector and emission line analysis with pPXF. We develop a robust classification scheme using X-ray and broad line luminosities, narrow-line ionization diagnostics, and optical variability to identify high-confidence TDEs, for which we analyze optical spectral features, light curve properties, and host galaxy demographics. Our final sample contains 52 TDEs with redshifts of $0.018 \\leq z\\leq0.714$, comprising 41 gold (high-confidence) and 11 silver (lower-confidence) events. The vast majority (93\\%) of gold TDEs are intrinsically brighter in the X-ray band, with $L_{\\rm X,peak} > L_{\\rm opt,peak}$.

        "abstract": "Massive black hole binaries are expected to be observable as periodic AGN in time-domain photometric surveys. Periodicities may originate from different physical processes, including the intermittent gas feeding of the black holes caused by the time-varying non-axisymmetric binary potential, the Doppler boosting of the flux emitted by individual accretion discs bound to the orbiting BHs, and the gravitational lensing of the accretion disc of one black hole due to the presence of the other. Only the Doppler boost scenario applied to circular binaries with non-modulated accretion predicts a sinusoidal light curve, while in the general case, binary signals are expected to show more complex periodic patterns. Current searches for massive black hole binaries rely on techniques tailored to quasi-sinusoidal light curves, but fail to identify the more complex periodicities predicted. We present an alternative method that leverages Gaussian processes, making use of a generic periodic kernel flexible enough for the identification of arbitrary periodicities in unevenly sampled light curves with realistic quasar noise. We demonstrate that it outperforms previously proposed strategies in identifying general periodicities by analysing mock light curves with different baselines. Specifically, we find that our analysis can detect non-sinusoidal periodicities (e.g., sawtooth-shaped) and retrieves a higher fraction of true periodicities when compared to periodogram analysis or Gaussian processes analysis with less flexible periodic kernels. Furthermore, by comparing the retrieved fraction of periodicities between mock PTF light curves and mock LSST light curves, we find that our analysis is most sensitive to the number of observed cycles. The application of this analysis has the potential to greatly increase the scientific return of current and upcoming large time-domain photometric surveys.",

Many AGN show a narrow Fe K-alpha line at 6.4 keV and associated Compton-scattered continua, produced by primary continuum scattering in cold, neutral material far from the central supermassive black hole. We present a novel approach based on Simulation-Based Inference with Neural Posterior Estimation (SBI-NPE) to train a machine-learning (ML) model using NuSTAR spectral fitting results from the literature, adopting the physically motivated MYTORUS-decoupled model, which separates line-of-sight and global equivalent hydrogen column densities (NH_Z and NH_S). To overcome limitations of traditional frequentist fitting such as local minima, limited automation, reproducibility, and computational cost, we employ normalizing flows and autoregressive networks to learn flexible posterior distributions from simulated spectra. From 34 NuSTAR spectral fits, we generate 34,000 synthetic spectra using uniform and Gaussian parameter distributions, showing that the latter is more strongly observationally driven. The network is trained to infer four MYTORUS parameters: NH_Z, NH_S, the photon index Gamma, and the relative normalization AS. Mutual information analysis identifies optimal spectral regions and motivates the inclusion of redshift, exposure time, and Galactic absorption. The observation-based grid significantly outperforms uniform sampling, achieving predictive accuracies above 90 percent for NH_S and AS, 89 percent for NH_Z, and 82 percent for Gamma within one sigma, with a joint accuracy of 70 percent for all parameters. We publicly release ML MYTORUS with a web interface enabling fast, reproducible inference from NuSTAR spectra. An application to NGC 4388 illustrates the promise of this approach.",

A negative Ricci scalar flips the sign of a non-minimally coupled mass term for a non-minimally coupled complex field $\\Phi$, driving its radial mode to large amplitudes via a tachyonic instability. At large $|\\Phi|$, higher-dimensional $U(1)$-breaking operators become relevant and impart a kick in the angular direction, generating a conserved $U(1)$ charge that sustains rotation as the symmetry is approximately restored. Because phases randomize across causally disconnected regions, multiple domains with distinct charges form. The subsequent axion potential converts the domain charges into an axion abundance, yielding dark matter even when the net global charge vanishes. We analyze the dynamics through a linear, domain-averaged treatment and identify two thermal histories: (i) Ricci reheating via saxion decays to Higgs bosons; (ii) external reheating with efficient damping of saxion energy by Higgs/fermion scatterings. The mechanism populates regions underabundant in standard misalignment, which are accessible to next generation axion searches.",

Despite the dramatic increase in the number of WZ Sge stars over the last decades, there are many unresolved questions, both in terms of their binary evolution and outburst mechanism. In this proceeding paper, I review the recent studies on WZ Sge stars, focusing on their outbursts. Recent observations, both photometrically and spectroscopically, have found the absence of enhanced emission from the hotspot during the early outburst rise in WZ Sge stars, casting doubt on the occurrence of the enhanced mass transfer. Meanwhile, several WZ Sge stars are newly suggested to harbor a magnetic white dwarf, inferring an inner disk truncation in quiescence. Diversity among systems has been discovered: a WZ Sge star with superoutbursts both accompanying and lacking an early superhump phase, one possibly harboring an ONe and massive white dwarf, and one showing optical spectra strongly affected by disk winds. I introduce the connections of WZ Sge stars to period bouncers, helium-rich AM CVn stars, and low-mass X-ray binaries.

We identify seven RR Lyrae and eight Cepheid variables with positional matches to X-ray sources. While most Cepheid associations appear reliable, the RR Lyrae matches are predominantly spurious. Only one source, OGLE-BLG-RRLYR-00252, appears to be a plausible RR Lyrae detection, potentially representing the first observational evidence of X-ray emission from a star of this type. Its inferred luminosity suggests that RR Lyrae stars are intrinsically at least two orders of magnitude fainter in X-rays than the brightest Cepheids. We also observe a tentative increase in X-ray luminosity with pulsation period among classical Cepheids, and higher luminosities in type II Cepheids at comparable periods. These trends may reflect intrinsic differences in atmospheric structure and shock efficiency, offering new insight into the mechanisms driving high-energy emission in pulsating stars.",

        "abstract": "We present the timing solutions for three radio pulsars discovered with the Green Bank North Celestial Cap (GBNCC) and 350-MHz Green Bank Telescope drift-scan surveys. These pulsars were initially discovered through their single-pulse emission and therefore designated as rotating radio transients (RRATs). Follow-up timing campaigns yielded a number of higher signal-to-noise summed pulse profiles for each pulsar, allowing us to obtain timing solutions both through single pulses as well as the standard method of time-integrating the pulsar's emission. We find that the two methods return timing parameters which are usually in agreement within two standard deviations, and have similar sized error bars. The single-pulse timing solutions have significantly higher RMS errors and reduced chi-squared values, likely due to pulse jitter. The distribution of wait times between detected single pulses indicates a significant amount of pulse clustering in time on short timescales from all three sources. For all sources, the presence of low-level emission outside of the sparse bright pulses and lack of giant pulses is more reminiscent of highly nulling canonical radio pulsars than extremely transient RRATs, highlighting the diversity of emission behavior observed from sources published as RRATs.",

The differential equations to determine the subleading correction of the structure variables are presented. The system retains the current $j^\\mu$ accounting for the steady flow, which contributes to the entropy current $s^\\mu$ in such a general covariant form that $s^\\mu=au^\\mu+ bj^\\mu$ with $a, b$ unknown parametric functions.

We revisit the corresponding model by Blasi et al. (2012), perform an extensive parameter study, and determine an optimal range of parameters that best fit the cosmic-ray data.

Further developments started from HBT experiments to exploit quantum bunching of photons in incoherent light sources played foundational role in the development of quantum optics.   When the two detectors in an HBT experiment are co-located, typically implemented using a beam splitter, a zero-baseline intensity correlation is obtained, which after deconvolution of the detector response function, yields the temporal component of the second-order coherence function. Unlike spatial correlations, this function is independent of the source brightness distribution, or its size, giving direct insight into the properties of the source's emission process itself - photon statistics. Along with photometric and spectral information, the second order coherence function can be used to constrain the emission mechanisms and discriminate between thermal, synchrotron, bremsstrahlung and stimulated emission processes. Evolution of the emission processes would likewise drive changes in the second order coherence. Light coherence information along with multi-wavelength observations, can become a complementary \"messenger\", carrying internal information about the astronomical source.",

        "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration radio bursts with poorly known origins. Most FRB sources are detected only once, while some are repeaters. Variation patterns observed in the rotation measure (RM) of some repeaters -- indicate that the local magneto-ionic environments of these FRB sources are highly dynamic. It has been suggested that a Be star-magnetar binary system is a possible origin for such variation. FRB 20201124A is notable among these sources since it is the most active one and exhibits substantial temporal variations of RM measured by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The physics behind this long-term behavior is poorly understood. Here we propose that, within the framework of the Be star-magnetar binary scenario, the observed variation of RM is attributed to a combination of orbital motion and the precession of the circumstellar disk of the Be star. While a ~785-day precession of the disk contributes to the observed decrease in the amplitude of the variation, our model predicts that the amplitude oscillates with this period.",

Using Zwicky Transient Facility light curves, we measure fractional variability ($F_{\\rm var}$) and rest-frame structure functions (SFs) to test whether short-term jet-linked variability is reflected in long-term behaviour. $\\gamma$-ray detected RL-NLSy1s and HPQs show steeply rising SFs, revealing strong long-term coherence despite modest $F_{\\rm var}$, consistent with Doppler-boosted synchrotron emission from relativistic jets. Non-jetted RL-NLSy1s exhibit the highest $F_{\\rm var}$ but plateauing SFs, indicative of stochastic, disc-driven fluctuations lacking long-term coherence. $\\gamma$-ray undetected RL-NLSy1s show the lowest $F_{\\rm var}$ and nearly flat SFs, consistent with weak or absent jet activity across all timescales. Colour-magnitude trends show that jet-dominated sources exhibit redder-when-brighter behaviour, whereas disc-dominated systems exhibit bluer-when-brighter trends. These results show that SF-derived temporal coherence, rather than variability amplitude alone, is a promising diagnostic of jet dominance and orientation, offering a framework for interpreting AGN variability in forthcoming time-domain surveys.",

        "abstract": "Rotationally resolved spectra of the HNC$^+$ and HCN$^+$ molecular ions have been recorded in the spectral range between 6200 and 6800 \\rcm\\ using a cryogenic ion trap instrument. The rovibrational transitions were probed using two different action spectroscopy schemes, namely laser-induced reaction (LIR) and leak-out spectroscopy (LOS). Various vibrational bands of HNC$^+$ and HCN$^+$ were measured with high resolution for the first time. For HNC$^+$, the $\\text{X}~^2\\Sigma^+~(20^00)-(00^00)$ overtone band was recorded using LIR, while LOS was used to probe the $\\text{X}~^2\\Pi~(000)^1-(210)^0\\mu$ combination band and the $\\text{X}~^2\\Pi~(000)^1-\\text{A}~^2\\Sigma^+~(10^00)$ vibronic band of HCN$^+$. Spectroscopic constants, band origins and radiative lifetimes for the observed states have been determined. The effective fit for the HCN$^+$ spectra revealed the presence of strong vibrational couplings leading to perturbations of the rovibrational levels of the excited states. The two action spectroscopy schemes are compared and their potential use to explore ion-molecule interactions is discussed.",

        "abstract": "Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) provide an opportunity to study supermassive black holes that are otherwise quiescent. The Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time will be capable of discovering thousands of TDEs each year, allowing for a dramatic increase in the number of discovered TDEs. The optical light curves from TDEs can be used to model the physical parameters of the black hole and disrupted star, but the sampling and photometric uncertainty of the real data will couple with model degeneracies to limit our ability to recover these parameters. In this work, we aim to model the impact of the Rubin survey strategy on simulated TDE light curves to quantify the typical errors in the recovered parameters. Black hole masses $5.5< \\log M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\odot < 8.2$ can be recovered with typical errors of 0.26 dex, with early coverage removing large outliers. Recovery of the mass of the disrupted star is difficult, limited by the degeneracy with the accretion efficiency. Only 57\\% of the cases have accurate recovery of whether the events are full or partial, so we caution the use this method to assess whether TDEs are partially or fully disrupted systems. Black hole mass measurements obtained from Rubin observations of TDEs will provide powerful constraints on the black hole mass function, black hole -- galaxy co-evolution, and the population of black hole spins, though continued work to understand the origin of TDE observables and how the TDE rate varies among galaxies will be necessarily to fully utilize the upcoming rich data set from Rubin.",

        "abstract": "The theoretical expectation that coronal loops should expand with height contrasts with observations that typically show constant cross-sections. We investigate the idea that this discrepancy results from loops being composed of fine threads whose expansion occurs below the resolution limits of instruments like SDO/AIA. In this paper, we present two significant findings: (1) several extended loops exhibit measurable expansion, suggesting length as a critical factor in detection capability, and (2) high-resolution Solar Orbiter/EUI observations have captured expanding loops in active regions. For both AIA and EUI data, we observe cases where thread separation is directly visible as the loops evolve. These findings complement our previous work indicating AIA loops may consist of relatively few threads. Collectively, these observations provide compeling evidence supporting the multi-thread model and offer a potential resolution to the long-standing loop expansion problem in solar coronal physics. However, the high densities and narrow temperature distributions of observed coronal loops remain unresolved.",

        "abstract": "Based on broadband timing analysis of Insight-HXMT and NICER data from the 2019 outburst of the black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) MAXI J1348-630, we report the detection of the coexistence and competitive interplay between type-C and type-B quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Specifically, the two QPO types were detected simultaneously but exhibited distinct energy dependencies: the type-C QPO was dominant in the hard X-ray band (10-30 keV), while the type-B QPO was more prominent in the soft X-ray band (1-10 keV). Further analysis reveals that the emergence of the type-C QPO suppresses the strength of the type-B QPO, particularly above 10 keV. Tracking the detailed evolution of these QPOs, we find that the weakening of the type-B QPO coincides with the strengthening of the type-C QPO, indicating a competitive interaction between them. These findings reveal a more complex relationship between type-B and type-C QPOs than previously recognized, suggesting they originate from distinct but interacting physical components within the accretion flow and/or jet, and providing new insights into the dynamics of accretion state transitions.",

Additionally, we find that these flows turn over and change direction at depths below 0.97R, forming circulation cells with lifetimes dictated again by the hemispheric magnetic imbalance, which is dominated by the occurrences of large sunspots. We also examine connections between cross-equatorial magnetic flux plumes and the flows, and discuss their implications for the equatorial flux cancellation/submergence and the poleward transport of flux.",

        "abstract": "The Citizen CATE 2024 next-generation experiment placed 43 identical telescope and camera setups along the path of totality during the total solar eclipse (TSE) on 8 April 2024 to capture a 60-minute movie of the inner and middle solar corona in polarized visible light. The 2024 TSE path covered a large geographic swath of North America and we recruited and trained 36 teams of community participants (\"citizen scientists\") representative of the various communities along the path of totality. Afterwards, these teams retained the equipment in their communities for ongoing education and public engagement activities. Participants ranged from students (K12, undergraduate, and graduate), educators, and adult learners to amateur and professional astronomers. In addition to equipment for their communities, CATE 2024 teams received hands-on telescope training, educational and learning materials, and instruction on data analysis techniques. CATE 2024 used high-cadence, high-dynamic-range (HDR) polarimetric observations of the solar corona to characterize the physical processes that shape its heating, structure, and evolution at scales and sensitivities that cannot be studied outside of a TSE. Conventional eclipse observations do not span sufficient time to capture changing coronal topology, but the extended observation from CATE 2024 does. Analysis of the fully calibrated dataset will provide deeper insight and understanding into these critical physical processes. We present an overview of the CATE 2024 project, including how we engaged local communities along the path of totality, and the first look at CATE 2024 data products from the 2024 TSE.",

        "abstract": "We present observations of the detection of a faint high-latitude jet in the inner coma of comet 3I/ATLAS that coincides with the broad plume detected in visible images along PA $280 \\pm 10^{\\circ}$. A detailed analysis shows that the jet was clearly detected on seven nights (2025, August~3, 5, 18, 19, 21, 24, and~29). The jet maintains an almost, though not perfectly, constant position angle (PA) throughout these epochs. High-precision PA measurements at a projected distance of 6000~km from the cometary optocenter reveal a periodic modulation centered at ~ 280 degrees, consistent with a high-latitude jet undergoing precessional motion around the sky-projected spin axis of the nucleus. This is the first periodic jet-angle modulation detected in an interstellar comet. The derived periodicity of $7.74 \\pm 0.35$ h may imply a nucleus rotation period of $P_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 15.48 \\pm 0.70$ h if the jet originates from a single active source near one of the poles. This value is slightly shorter than the period of $P_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 16.79 \\pm 0.23$ h derived from the photometric time series. From the measured PA range, the sky-projected orientation of the spin axis is derived as $\\mathrm{PA} = 280.7 \\pm 0.2^{\\circ}$",

We present a comprehensive analysis of the X-ray timing and spectral variability of 16 Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies detected by Fermi-LAT, based on 29 epochs of XMM-Newton observations. A moderate intraday flux variability is observed throughout the sample, with fractional variability ranging from 5 to 16\\%. The temporal study of 1H\\,0323+342 reveals a distinctive turnover timescale in structure functions, along with notable variations in flux and power spectral density slopes. The hardness ratio in some epochs demonstrates a clear trend of softer-when-brighter. The X-ray spectra of 1H 0323+342, PMN J0948+0022, RGB J1644+263, PKS 1502+036, and J1246+0238 are well fitted by a power-law + blackbody model, suggesting a bright disk along with a jet, and J1222+0413 is fitted by broken power-law, while the remaining sources are well fitted by a power-law model revealing the non-thermal domination. The X-ray luminosity exhibits a strong correlation with $\\gamma$-ray and disk luminosity, and a strong correlation with the jet power, suggesting a close coupling of disk and jet. Additionally, we have found an anti-correlation between the X-ray spectral index and the X-ray luminosity, as well as with the FWHM of H$\\beta$ line, indicating a complex interaction between the central engine, jet activity, and the accretion disk in these sources.",

Many aspects of these interaction processes are not well-understood till date. Using the energy spectra measured in two mutually orthogonal top hat analyzers (THA 1 and 2), which are part of the Solar Wind Ion Spectrometer (SWIS) subsystem of the Aditya Solar Wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) on board India's Aditya L1 mission, we gain insights into intricate features of ICME ICME interactions during May 2024 solar event. We report here an unprecedented two-orthogonal-plane perspective of ICME ICME interactions for the first time from the L1 point. The investigation reveals a special interaction region formed by the propagation of the forward shock driven by complex ejecta in the preceding ICME. The interaction causes the formation of a downstream region spanning over 13 hours, which propagates in the interplanetary medium. The observations reveal that this region serves as a site for proton and alpha particle energization, and the particles within this region get distributed from one plane to the other. The presence of forward shock and particle energization is confirmed by the energetic particle flux measurements by the SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of ASPEX. These observations provide an unprecedented perspective on how solar wind ions become energized and distributed in an ICME-ICME interaction region.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates how a self bound equation of state (EOS), which describes strange quark stars, affects the rotational properties of compact stars, focusing on deviations from universal relations governing gravitational mass and radius changes due to rotation. The analysis reveals significant deviations in stars with higher surface-to-center total energy-density ratios, $\\frac{\\epsilon_s}{\\epsilon_c+c^2P_c}$, challenging the established universal relations.   For Newtonian stars, hydrostatic equilibrium ensures that the difference between the gravitational potential at the center, $\\Phi_c$, and at the poles, $\\Phi_p$, remains constant within sequences of rotating neutron stars characterized by the same central and polar specific enthalpy ($\\Phi_c - \\Phi_p = -h_c +h_p$). Combined with the scaling $\\Phi \\propto R_e^2$, where $R_e$ denotes the equatorial radius, this condition naturally leads to a quasi-universal behavior in the rotational change of radius within these sequences. Similarly, in general relativistic stars, the hydrostatic equilibrium maintains that $\\Phi^{GR}_{p} - \\Phi^{GR}_{c}$ remains unchanged within these sequences, where $\\Phi^{GR}$ is one of the metric potentials.   Inspired by this theoretical framework, a toy model has been developed to capture the dependence of gravitational mass and radius deviations on the surface-to-central total energy density ratio. Subsequently, an improved set of empirical universal relations has been proposed, for accurately modeling rapidly rotating compact stars with self-bound EOSs.",

Two types of spicules, referred to as types I and II, have been identified in observations and studied in previous numerical works. The statistics of type II spicules in 3D numerical simulations have not yet been studied. We aim to compare the statistics of properties such as lengths, lifetimes, widths, heights, inclinations, and maximum velocities of self-consistently formed spicules in a MURaM-ChE simulation with observations. We employ a H$\\alpha$ proxy to identify fine-scale structures at the solar limb resembling spicules in a simulation of an enhanced network region. We track the evolution of 58 such features found in a 21-minute time sequence, and compare their dynamical and morphological properties with those derived from quiet-Sun observations using the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard the Hinode mission in the Ca II H spectral line. Previous studies have shown that spicules show very similar properties in Ca II H and H$\\alpha$. The spicule-like structures found in the simulation have statistical properties which are broadly consistent with those observed with Hinode/SOT. In particular, we find evidence for the self-consistent formation of both type I and type II spicules within the simulation, even in the absence of ambipolar diffusion. We also investigate the properties of rapid blueshifted and redshifted excursions (RBEs and RREs) in the simulation in relation to the spicules.",

Taurus is a long-duration balloon instrument designed for rapid azimuthal scanning at approximately 30 deg/s using a motorized pivot at the flight-train connection, without a reaction wheel. We model the gondola as a rigid body subject to realistic disturbances and sensing limitations, and implement a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) that estimates attitude and gyroscope bias by fusing inertial and vector-camera measurements. A simple PI controller uses the estimated states to regulate yaw rate. Numerical simulations incorporating representative disturbance and measurement noise levels are used to evaluate closed-loop control performance and MEKF behavior under flight-like conditions. Experimental tests on the Taurus gondola validate the pivot-only approach, demonstrating stable high-rate tracking under realistic hardware constraints. The close agreement between simulation and experiment indicates that the simplified rigid-body model captures the dominant dynamics relevant for controller design and integrated estimation-and-control development.",

We find that near-surface inflows towards active latitudes are part of a local circulation with an outflow away from them at depths around 0.97 R, which is also the location where the deviations in the radial gradient of rotation change sign. These results, together with opposite-signed changes over latitude and depth in the above quantities observed during the solar minimum period, point to the action of the Coriolis force on large-scale flows as the primary cause of changes in the rotation gradient within the NSSL. We also find that such Coriolis force-mediated changes in near-surface flows towards active latitudes only marginally change the amplitude of zonal flow and hence are not likely to be its driving force. Our measurements typically achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio ($>$5$\\sigma$) for near-surface flows but can drop to 3$\\sigma$ near the base (0.95 R) of the NSSL. Close agreements between the depth profiles of changes in rotation gradient and in meridional flows measured from quite different global and local helioseismic techniques, respectively, show that the results are not dependent on the analysis techniques.",

This broad energy range has been covered by using compound semiconductor detectors: cadmium telluride (CdTe: 8 - 70 keV) and cadmium zinc telluride (CZT: 20 - 150 keV) with geometric areas of 0.5 cm$^2$ and 32 cm$^2$, respectively. A stainless steel collimator provides a field-of-view of 6$^\\circ$ $\\times$ 6$^\\circ$ optimized to limit the off-axis response while keeping the design within the instrument mass constraints. The in-house designed low-noise digital pulse processing-based front-end electronics has achieved a spectral resolution of $\\approx$ 1 keV at 14 keV (CdTe) and $\\approx$ 7 keV at 60 keV (CZT). The instrument is also equipped with processing and power electronics to process the signal, drive the electronics, bias the detectors with required low and high voltages for optimal performance of the overall system. In this article, we present design aspects of the instrument, results from the pre-launch ground-based tests, and the in-orbit operations, which have indicated optimal performance in line with that expected.",

The prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (pSCT) was inaugurated in 2019 at Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) in Arizona and observed significant gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula with a partially populated camera. The pSCT camera is currently being upgraded to fully instrument the focal plane with 11,328 silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels split between 177 camera modules. Additionally, the modules will feature upgraded electronics designed to reduce electronics crosstalk and noise. A module calibration procedure has been developed using a preproduction test module. Following this calibration procedure, performance testing shows that the upgrade module has low noise, minimal electronics crosstalk, and excellent charge resolution. After calibration and optimization, the 177 production modules will be installed in the pSCT camera for commissioning. This will be followed by observations of known VHE gamma-ray sources for camera performance validation.",

        "abstract": "The factors that control the maximum energy attained by protons and electrons during magnetic reconnection are investigated analytically and using large-scale simulations with the \\textit{kglobal} model. Previous work revealed that a strong ambient guide field strongly impacts particle energy gain during reconnection, suppressing energy gain from Fermi reflection by increasing the radius of curvature of reconnected field lines. However, previous simulations have also shown that the maximum energy gain increases with the system size. The physical basis for this result has not been explored. We perform simulations that vary the effective system size over a large range to isolate the processes determining the maximum energy gain. The maximum energy $W_{max}$ is regulated by the number of magnetic-island mergers that occur, as multiple flux ropes that form at early time repeatedly merge until the largest approaches the system scale. Fermi reflection in these repeated mergers dominates particle energy gain. The number of mergers is linked to the effective system size -- larger systems produce a larger number of flux ropes and more mergers. That $W_{max}$ is linked to the number of flux rope mergers has implications for understanding why particle-in-cell simulations only produce powerlaw distributions of energetic particles with a limited range in energy.",

        "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a $\\sim$ millisecond-long transient phenomenon that propagate across extragalactic distances and are effectively a point source. Radio wave propagation through inhomogeneous distributions of plasma can act as a lens, generating multiple images of the emitted electric field. A lens can produce images of a point source where the phase of the electric field between images remains coherent when observed by a radio telescope. FRB 20220413B shows a complicated pulse structure with time separated components that may be image copies of the main components due to plasma lensing. We perform several analyses to determine if FRB 20220413B is consistent with expectations of a plasma lensed FRB. We analyze and fit the morphology of the burst to a plasma lens model and find consistency in the spectro-temporal profile but not the observed flux. Using the complex-valued channelized voltage data from the CHIME telescope, we perform a time-lag correlation analysis and report correlation signatures present in the electric field of FRB 20220413B. We find that there exists an excess correlation signature only in absolute power and not in phase. We perform a frequency-lag correlation analysis on the spectra of all subcomponents of the burst and find a consistent scintillation bandwidth across all components. We find the scintillation bandwidth is consistent with expectations of scattering due to the Milky Way. We interpret this as all burst components propagating through the same scintillation screen located in the Milky Way, which would generate the excess variance signature observed, even in the absence of phase coherence between burst components. We find that while the burst morphology can be modeled by a plasma lens, the coherent signature present in the time-lag correlation is consistent with the expectations of a common scattering screen, but not coherent plasma lensing.",

        "abstract": "This paper primarily explores the dynamics of charged particle in the magnetized SV spacetime, and constrains the parameters of the SV spacetime along with its surrounding magnetic fields. The constraints are given by using $\\chi^2$ analysis combined with high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) data observed from three microquasars: GRS 1915+105, XTE 1550-564, and GRO J1655-40. The results indicate that the magnetic field significantly influences the position of the innermost stable circular orbit of charged particle and frequency distribution of epicyclic motion, which excites more resonance model variants, enhancing observational effects. Additionally, we employ the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to evaluate resonance model and its various variants. The support for different models from observational data shows significant variation: $E R_8$ as the best model is supported strongly, $ER_3$ model has moderate evidence of support, $ER_6$ and $ER_7$ models are considerably less support, while other resonance models have essentially no support. For models more supported by the observational data, the allowed ranges of the regularization parameter: $0\\leq a<0.736$ ($68\\%$ confidence level) suggests that HFQPOs data support the magnetized black bounce spacetime as a regular black hole, and the smaller value of the regularization parameter indicates a possibility of the presence of quantum effects. According to the constraint results, we get the best-fit values of magnetic field strength around $10^{-5}\\sim 10^{-4}$ GS for electrons and around $10^{-2}\\sim 10^{-1}$ GS for protons. Finally, as a comparison, we test the SV spacetime without a magnetic field using microquasar observational data, and the calculated results of AIC show that this case is incompatible with the HFQPOs data, further supporting the existence of a magnetic field in SV spacetime.",

For a number of commonly used data sources, together with softwares that query and then output processed data, we identify their respective defects and inconsistencies, quantify their extent, and show how they can affect the predictions produced by data-driven machine learning forecasting models. We also outline procedures for fixing these issues or at least mitigating their impacts.

Our study derives the Hawking temperature using standard surface gravity methods and examines quantum corrections through both the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and exponential entropy modifications, showing enhanced thermal radiation and potential remnant formation scenarios. The gravitational redshift analysis separates contributions from mass, cosmological constant, electromagnetic charge, and Born-Infeld (BI) corrections, with the latter scaling as $a^4/r^6$ and thus confined to near-horizon regimes. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate light deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, demonstrating how dispersive media can either enhance or suppress nonlinear electrodynamic signatures depending on observational configurations. The thermodynamic analysis in extended phase space, where the BH mass corresponds to enthalpy, reveals phase structures with heat capacity transitions between positive and negative values, indicating regions of local stability and instability sensitive to parameter choices. We study BH heat engines operating in rectangular thermodynamic cycles, achieving efficiencies of $\\eta \\sim 0.11$--$0.21$ that reach 30--61\\% of the corresponding Carnot limits, consistent with other AdS BH systems. Comparison with Johnson's analysis confirms that BI corrections to heat engine efficiency are of order $10^{-12}$ for typical parameter ranges, though these effects become appreciable in the strong-field regime where $r_h \\lesssim 1.5$ in Planck units.

Time-Normalised Optical Flow (TNOF) is a method developed for mapping PD velocity fields in time series of Extreme-Ultraviolet (EUV) images. We show PD velocity fields of a quiet Sun (QS) region containing a small coronal hole (CH) and filament channel (FC) jointly observed by Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) aboard the Solar Orbiter and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The QS observations acquired on 28 October 2023 in 174A channel of High Resolution EUV Imager (HRIEUV) of EUI and 171A channel of AIA are used. During the time of the observations, the separation angle between Solar Orbiter and SDO was approximately 26\\de. A novel image alignment analysis shows that the dominant formation heights are 11.4Mm for HRIEUV and 4Mm for AIA. Despite this height difference, the PD velocity fields obtained from the observations from the two instruments are in good agreement across the region. In the QS the median PD speed is around 6.7 and 7.4\\kms\\ for HRIEUV and AIA respectively, with maximum speeds of around 40\\kms. The small equatorial CH is a region dominated by a low temperature of $\\approx$0.8MK and is host to high PD speeds, with a median speed of 17\\kms. The velocity field bridges coherently across the CH from neighbouring QS regions from east to west, thus the CH must be overlaid by a system of long, low-lying closed magnetic loops. This unexpected configuration is supported by a potential field (PF) magnetic model and may be due to the longevity of the CH, allowing time for interchange reconnection with neighbouring closed-field regions. The FC is observed to be multithermal, with a narrow central strip of high emission at both low (0.8MK) and high (2.5MK) temperatures and low emission at warm (1.2MK) temperature. The FC has PD speeds similar to those of the QS.",

        "abstract": "Pulsar glitches are unresolved increments of the rotation rate that sometimes trigger an enhancement of the spin-down rate. On occasions, the augmented spin-down decays gradually in an exponential manner, particularly after the largest glitch events. The young pulsar PSR J0537-6910 exhibits the highest known glitching rate, with 60 events detected in nearly 18 years of monitoring. Despite most PSR J0537-6910 glitches being large, only one exponential recovery has been reported, following its first discovered glitch. This is puzzling, as pulsars of similar characteristics typically present significant exponential recoveries. We aim to determine whether this reflects an intrinsic difference in PSR J0537-6910 or a detectability issue, for example due to its high glitch frequency. The full dataset, including recent NICER observations, was systematically searched for exponential relaxations. Each glitch was tested for evidence of a recovery over a broad range of trial timescales. Promising candidates were investigated further by comparing recovery models with and without an exponential term using Bayesian evidence. We discovered six new glitches, bringing the total to 66. Our criteria strongly indicates the presence of 11 previously undetected exponential recoveries. We presente updated glitch and timing solutions. Exponential recoveries are detected only for the largest glitches, though not all of them. The inferred timescales range from 4 to 37 d, with the decaying frequency increment generally below $1\\%$ of the total. We find that $\\ddot\\nu$ can remain stable across several glitches, with persistent changes associated with only some events. In particular, it tends to be lowest after glitches with exponential recoveries, yielding inter-glitch braking indices between 6 and 9. Following glitches without recoveries, $\\ddot\\nu$ is higher, leading to braking indices between 10 and 35.",

In parallel, PASJ shows episodic above-baseline impact through facility- or mission-driven special issues and features that, given the journal's modest annual volume, can materially shift year-level metrics. These patterns point to two potential avenues for PASJ: well-timed, thoughtfully organized special issues and features that highlight high-impact results, and continued strengthening of international collaboration.",

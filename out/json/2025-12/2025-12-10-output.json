        "title": "Predicting Infall Time of Milky-Way Satellites via Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "The properties of dwarf galaxies provide essential insight into galaxy formation and evolution in a hierarchical universe. Among various physical quantities, identifying their infall times to host galaxies is crucial, as these times encode key information such as star formation histories. However, estimating infall times remains challenging due to the complex interplay between different physical processes and the lack of consensus among existing methods. We propose a fast and interpretable method to predict the infall time of dwarf satellites using LightGBM, a gradient-boosting decision tree algorithm. Our model is trained on satellites from 30 Milky Way (MW)-like host galaxies generated by A-SLOTH, a semi-analytic model calibrated using observational constraints, including those from the MW and its satellites. To balance predictive ability and observational applicability, we adopt $\\tau_{90}$, [Fe/H], and $M_{\\star}$ as input features. Since satellites with prior group membership hinder accurate MW infall predictions, we exclude them from the training data. As a result, the model achieves the best average mean squared error (MSE) of 5.04 in the A-SLOTH data set. Our model also shows good agreement with existing observational studies of MW satellites, although some discrepancies remain due to a few outliers such as CVn II and UMa I. In addition, for satellites experiencing prior infall events before MW-like host infall, the model predicts the timing of the first infall with a significantly lower MSE of 1.66, indicating the importance of the earliest infall in the quenching process of satellite galaxies.",

        "abstract": "The evidence for dark matter (DM) remains compelling, although attempts to understand its particle nature remain inconclusive. One promising method to study DM is detecting DM subhalos through their gravitational interactions with stellar streams. In this study, we apply Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) to constrain subhalo interaction parameters, including mass, scale radius, velocity, and encounter geometry, from stellar stream kinematics. We generate particle spray simulations based on the Lagrange Cloud stripping technique, focusing on the ATLAS-Aliqa Uma stream as a test case. We train multiple NPE models across multiple observational scenarios, quantifying how kinematic completeness affects inference and forecasting constraints from upcoming surveys including LSST, 4MOST, and 10-year Gaia data. Our results demonstrate that NPE can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors. In the idealized case with full 6D coordinates, we achieve subhalo mass uncertainties of 15-20% for a $10^7 \\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ subhalo, with 5D coordinates (excluding radial velocities) achieving similar performance. Under realistic observational conditions, mass uncertainties range from 50% (present-day) to 20-40% (future scenarios), with comparable performance between the photometric-only LSST sample and a smaller sample that includes Gaia proper motions and 4MOST radial velocities. Most notably, we find that velocity bimodality emerges when phase space is poorly sampled, whether due to missing kinematic information or limited stellar tracers. Combining large photometric samples with targeted spectroscopic follow-up can effectively resolves this degeneracy. These results demonstrate the power of implicit likelihood inference for optimizing stellar stream observational strategies and forecasting DM subhalo constraints from upcoming surveys.",

Using three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson simulations of multiple soliton mergers, we explore both repulsive and attractive regimes across a wide range of scattering lengths. Our results show that repulsive self-interactions lead to more massive and extended cores with lower central densities compared to the free (non-interacting) fuzzy dark matter case, while attractive interactions enhance central densities and can drive cores toward collapse, once a critical mass is exceeded. We confirm that the mass-radius relation of solitonic cores is well described by analytical predictions, even in the presence of self-interactions, and we extend the core-halo mass relation to scenarios beyond fuzzy dark matter. We find that the scaling relations between core mass, size, and total energy are not universal but depend sensitively on the strength and sign of the self-interaction, as well as on the evolutionary stage of the halo. These results demonstrate that self-interactions provide a natural mechanism to regulate core properties, with important implications for the formation of supermassive black holes and for potential astrophysical signatures in galactic cores.",

        "abstract": "Context: Recently, JWST/NIRSpec observations have provided the first detections of warm ionised outflows in low-mass galaxies at high redshifts (z>3), revealing an occurrence rate of 25-40% depending on the intensity of the emission lines. This fraction is lower than predicted by simulations, which suggest that fast outflowing gas should be a common feature of all star-forming galaxies in the early Universe. Aims: In order to better understand the discrepancies between simulations and observations, we identify and characterize outflows in high-redshift galaxies using the TNG50 cosmological and SERRA zoom-in simulations. Our study examines how outflow detectability depends on the line of sight, explores the properties of the fast gas, and investigates its relationship with key galactic properties. Methods: We analyse approximately 60000 galaxies from TNG50 and 3000 galaxies from SERRA over the redshift ranges z=3-5 and z=4-5, respectively, spanning stellar masses of Mstar=10^7.5-10^11Msun. Outflows in the immediate vicinity of each galaxy are identified using a Gaussian mixture model algorithm that uses the gas velocity, star-formation-rate, and location as input parameters. We subsequently compare the simulated outflows to those observed in the JWST/JADES NIRSpec survey. Results: Outflow masses in both TNG50 and SERRA broadly reproduce the JWST/JADES measurements within roughly 0.5dex, though simulations tend to predict slightly higher values, suggesting that optical emission lines capture only a fraction of the multiphase outflow. However, simulated outflow velocities are typically an order of magnitude lower than those inferred from observations. TNG50 indicates a clear orientation dependence as outflows in face-on galaxies are approximately 15% more likely to be detected than in edge-on systems, with this difference increasing to nearly 40% for more massive, disc-shaped galaxies.",

        "abstract": "We present a sample of low HI mass dwarf galaxies ($M_{\\rm HI} < 10^8 M_\\odot$) detected by The FAST All Sky HI Survey (FASHI) project. Due to the faint and irregular morphology of these galaxies, the default photometry is often inaccurate. Therefore, we utilized The Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) data to perform careful photometric measurements, and find that the low HI mass galaxies have similar stellar mass densities to dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies. Compared to other dwarf galaxy populations, the HI-selected dwarfs exhibit higher stellar mass densities than ultradiffuse galaxies, and similar densities to HI-selected low-surface-brightness galaxies, albeit with lower stellar masses, suggesting a possible evolutionary connection among these populations. By classifying the galaxies according to their HI spectral-line profiles, we show that the double-peaked sources conform closely to the Tully-Fisher relation, whereas the single-peaked sources follow the Faber-Jackson relation but with large scatter. This indicates that the single-peaked systems are likely dispersion dominated and that the relationship between stellar mass and halo mass in such systems may remain consistent across both low- and high-mass regimes. These findings suggest that HI-selected dwarf galaxies with single-peaked HI profiles may share a similar dynamical state with massive ellipticals, offering new insights into their structural evolution and the diversity of formation pathways for low-mass galaxies.",

However, while we have ample, homogeneous data for galaxies with halo masses $M_h \\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ the data available for low-mass galaxies is more sparse, and both GCS mass and halo mass estimates are determined using varying methodologies. This work compiles all available literature data for dwarf galaxies with confident stellar mass and GC count estimates, and converts these estimates to GCS masses and peak halo masses using a standard conversion. This allows for a consistent comparison of these masses to be made and a complete study of the behaviour of the $M_{GCS}-M_h$ relation to be conducted. We compare the positions of classical dwarfs on the scaling relation to that of ultra diffuse galaxies and extremely low-surface brightness galaxies and find that these non-classical dwarfs have, on average, systematically higher GC specific frequencies. This also makes them, on average, systematically positively offset from the $M_{GCS}-M_h$ relation, driving much of the high-$M_{GCS}$ scatter observed.",

The $\\nabla \\mathrm{[O/H]}$-$M_*$ relation of the MAGPI galaxies generally agrees with theoretical predictions, where a combination of stellar feedback, gas transport, and accretion shapes the metallicity profile, with the dominant processes varying with galaxy mass. We find a positive correlation between $\\nabla \\mathrm{[O/H]}$ and gas velocity dispersion ($r=0.36$), indicating that stronger gas turbulence is associated with flatter or inverted metallicity gradients, likely due to enhanced gas mixing. Additionally, smaller galaxies tend to have flatter or positive gradients, suggesting that metal dilution by gas accretion or removal via feedback-driven winds may outweigh metal enrichment in small galaxies.",

We examine global differences between the models, and investigate the impacts on star formation. We include a time-dependent, non-equilibrium chemical network coupled to a thermal evolution scheme and supernova feedback. Our magnetic field amplifies via dynamo action from a small initial seed field. We find a more compact magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disc (radius ~ 5.1kpc, compared to ~ 7.4kpc), with a diffuse atomic envelope above and below the plane that is not seen in the hydrodynamic (HD) case. The HD disc displays a smoother, more even radial distribution of gas and star formation, and more bubbly substructure. Our MHD simulation has a higher proportion of dense, gravitationally unbound gas than the HD case, but a lower star formation rate, an average between 125-150Myr of ~ 4.8 solar masses per year, compared to ~ 8.4 solar masses per year. We see a clear shift in the KS relation to higher gas surface densities in the MHD case, more consistent with observations.

However, the excitation processes of OH remain poorly characterized. We provide a new set of collisional rate coefficients for OH with H$_2$, expanding the existing data to $j$ levels up to $j=15/2$ and temperatures up to 750 K. These rate coefficients are obtained from state-to-state collision cross sections calculated by means of well-converged close-coupling quantum scattering calculations for collisions of OH with para- and ortho-H$_2$ with energies up to 1700 cm$^{-1}$ ($\\simeq 2450$ K). We reproduce the rate coefficients computed by Klos et al. (2017) and extend their results to higher temperatures and higher rotational levels of OH. The de-excitation rate coefficients are lower in collisions with para-H$_2$ ($j_{\\rm H_2} = 0$) due to the absence of a quadrupole moment, but this difference decreases at higher temperatures. We find that the rate coefficients follow scaling relations with the energy gap between the upper and lower levels of a given transition, which allows extrapolation to higher OH rotational states $j_{\\rm OH}$. As a first application, we show that under astrophysical conditions typical of warm and dense gas around nascent stars, the populations of low-$j_{\\rm OH}$ states are dominated by collisions, even when chemical pumping is included.

New JWST NIRCam imaging and high-resolution NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy span the rest-frame ultraviolet to optical. The NIRCam imaging reveals bright star-forming clumps and a tail consisting of three distinct, extremely compact star clusters that are multiply-imaged by gravitational lensing. The star clusters have effective radii of $R_{\\rm{eff}} \\sim 5$ pc, stellar masses of $M_{*} \\sim 10^{6}-10^{7}\\,M_{\\odot}$, and high stellar mass surface densities of $\\Sigma_{*} > 10^{4}\\,M_{\\odot}~\\rm{pc}^{-2}$. While their stellar populations are very young ($\\sim 5-9$ Myr), their dynamical ages exceed unity, consistent with the clusters being gravitationally bound systems. Placing the star clusters in the size vs.~stellar mass density plane, we find they occupy a region similar to other high-redshift star clusters within galaxies observed recently with JWST, being significantly more massive and denser than local star clusters. Spatially resolved analysis of the brightest clump reveals a compact, intensely star-forming core. The ionizing photon production efficiency ($\\xi_{\\rm{ion}}$) is slightly suppressed in this central region, potentially indicating a locally elevated Lyman continuum escape fraction facilitated by feedback-driven channels.",

        "abstract": "A subset of very young, super-early galaxies at $z\\gtrsim10$, often termed Blue Monsters, shows extremely blue UV continua and faint far-IR emission, which could imply much less dust than expected from standard enrichment scenarios. We seek to understand the possible reason behind the apparent absence of dust in the Blue Monsters. We show how clustered supernovae drive mechanical blowout in stratified, self-gravitating clouds by combining full 3-D hydrodynamical dust-survival yields with 3-D thin-shell scalings, and we predict the retained dust-to-stellar mass ratio at the cluster scale and the corresponding galaxy-integrated value. We take the net dust yield per unit stellar mass from existing 3-D hydrodynamical studies of young stellar clusters with sequential supernovae, and we set the blowout radius as a function of gas concentration using established 3-D thin-shell scalings. Assuming gas-dust coupling across the blowout boundary, the retained dust-to-stellar ratio accounts for the fraction of supernovae that remain confined versus those that vent mechanically. Across typical cluster masses, sizes, and cloud-scale star formation efficiencies, mechanical venting removes a large share of gas and dust. The retained dust-to-stellar mass ratio is lowered by about half to two orders of magnitude relative to the supernova net dust yield. The outcome depends mainly on gas concentration and only weakly on metallicity, so it remains effective at low $Z$. After weighting by a Schechter cluster mass function and a Weibull core-radius distribution, the galaxy-integrated value falls in the same range inferred for spectroscopically confirmed Blue Monsters. Thus, mechanical venting at the cluster scale can account for the very low dust fractions inferred for Blue Monsters without requiring extreme in situ destruction and without fine-tuning.",

        "abstract": "Gravito-inertial-mode asteroseismology of intermediate-mass main-sequence stars took off with the 5-month uninterrupted light curves of the CoRoT space mission. It was developed in detail from the 4-year-long Kepler light curves, which provided a practical means to measure the rotation frequency in the transition layer between the convective core and the radiative envelope, where the local buoyancy frequency reaches a maximum. Recently, a new buoyancy glitch inversion method based on the Fourier spectra of gravity-mode period spacings was developed to probe that region further (Guo 2025). We aim to exploit the information contained in the variability of gravity-mode period spacings ($\\Delta P$) in Slowly Pulsating B (SPB) stars with rotation. We investigate how well the main-sequence evolutionary stage can be inferred from this variability. We extract the frequency and amplitude of the variability in $\\Delta P$ from the Fourier spectrum (FT). Both the period spacing $\\Delta P$ and its periodic perturbations $\\delta P$ (deviations from their asymptotic values) are used. The measured dominant frequency of $\\Delta P$ allows us to infer the central hydrogen mass fraction, $X_c$, which is a main-sequence age indicator. The inferred $X_c$ values from $FT(\\Delta P)$ mostly agree with previous results reported in the literature based on forward modelling of individual identified mode frequencies.   We find that the buoyancy glitches $\\delta N/N$ in SPB stars are generally less than $2\\%$ in amplitude. Ensemble asteroseismic modeling of gravity-mode pulsators can now be carried out efficiently with our novel $FT(\\Delta P)$ method once the internal rotation rate of the pulsators is known. Our methodology offers a fast method for gravito-inertial asteroseismic applications in the era of ongoing and future space-based observations.",

        "abstract": "The nature of dark matter (DM) is still debated. While cold DM (CDM) is the standard paradigm, warm DM (WDM) may ease some small-scale tensions in the $\\Lambda$CDM framework. Line-intensity mapping (LIM) offers a novel probe of DM properties. To explore the potential of LIM surveys in constraining the WDM particle mass ($m_\\mathrm{WDM}$) by means of the [C II] power spectrum (PS), we provide forecasts for the Deep Spectroscopic Survey (DSS) at $z\\simeq3.6$ and extend the analysis to larger sky coverage, higher sensitivity, and/or increased spectral resolution. We develop a formulation for the [C II] PS based on the halo-model approach, incorporating the uncertainty in the luminosity function (LF) through two alternative parameterisations. We perform a Bayesian analysis on mock data to derive constraints on $m_\\mathrm{WDM}$. In a CDM universe, the DSS yields lower limits on $m_\\mathrm{WDM}$ at $95\\%$ credibility level (CL) of $1.10$ keV and $0.58$ keV when considering the optimistic and pessimistic LF ($\\alpha = -1.1$), respectively. Ambitious surveys can improve these figures to $5.82$ keV and $1.90$ keV, and assuming a steeper faint-end slope ($\\alpha = -1.9$) further boosts these limits. A fivefold increase in spectral resolution enhances sensitivity to the damping scale associated to redshift-space distortions, tightening the constraints on $m_\\mathrm{WDM}$ by a factor of up to $\\sim1.8$. Finally, Bayesian inference on mock data with $m_\\mathrm{WDM}=3$ keV results in a well-constrained and unbiased posterior only in futuristic survey setups. Upcoming LIM surveys can provide meaningful limits on $m_\\mathrm{WDM}$, although the negligible contribution from small haloes reduces the constraining power of the [C II] PS. Future progress will benefit from combining multiple redshifts and emission lines, opening the way to competitive constraints on the nature of DM.",

        "abstract": "We present a homogeneous abundance analysis of 160 main-sequence stars in astrometric white-dwarf + main-sequence (WD+MS) binaries with orbits from Gaia DR3. These systems have AU-scale separations and are thought to have undergone mass transfer (MT) when the WD progenitor was an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. Using high-resolution spectroscopy, we measure chemical abundances of the MS stars, focusing on s-process elements. Since s-process nucleosynthesis occurs mainly in AGB stars, s-process enhancement in the MS star is a key signature of accretion from an AGB companion. We identify 40 barium dwarfs -- 36 of them newly discovered -- roughly doubling the known population in astrometric WD+MS binaries and extending it to lower metallicities than previously studied. The s-process abundances show large star-to-star variations that correlate with component masses and with metallicity but not with orbital separation. At the lowest metallicities, three barium dwarfs display strong CH and $\\rm C_2$ absorption bands, linking them to CEMP-s stars and implying that AGB mass transfer usually leads to strong carbon enhancement at low metallicity. By comparing the observed abundance patterns to AGB nucleosynthesis models, we show that the diversity of s-process enhancements can be explained by variations in donor mass, metallicity, and most importantly, the number of thermal pulses the AGB star experienced before the onset of MT. Variation in the depth of the accretors' convective envelopes, with which accreted material is diluted, strengthens correlations with MS star mass and metallicity. Our results establish Gaia WD+MS binaries as a powerful laboratory for constraining binary mass-transfer physics and the origins of chemically peculiar stars.",

Leveraging detections of faint auroral emission lines in 76 galaxies at z>1 from both the MARTA survey and a large compilation of high-redshift literature objects, we derive direct electron temperature-based abundances for nitrogen and oxygen using rest-frame optical lines. We establish the first high-redshift calibrations of strong-line N/O diagnostics based on direct abundance measurements, finding no significant evolution for either N2O2 = [NII]6585/[OII]3727,3729 and N2S2 = [NII]6585/[SII]6717,6731 diagnostics compared to local realisations. We then investigate the N/O-O/H relation across cosmic time using both direct abundances and strong-line based measurements (additional 430 galaxies). We find evidence for mild but systematic nitrogen enhancement at high redshift: galaxies at z>1 exhibit N/O ratios elevated by ~0.18 dex (median offset) at fixed O/H compared to the local relation, with a more pronounced enhancement at low metallicity (12+log(O/H) < 8.1) where the offset reaches up to ~0.3-0.4 dex. Our results provide the most extensive confirmation of elevated N/O ratios at high-redshift to date based on rest-optical diagnostics. The chemical signatures of N/O-enhanced galaxies in our sample resembles that of first-generation globular cluster stars, suggesting that the moderate nitrogen enhancement may reflect the late stages of a cluster-driven enrichment mode that dominated at earlier cosmic epochs. However, the relevance and relative contribution of different mechanisms (e.g. burstiness of the star-formation history, contribution from older stellar populations, differential metal-loaded outflows, inflows of pristine gas) remains to be fully disentangled.",

A standard siren measurement with a nearby (luminosity distance $\\sim 40 $ Mpc) event such as GW170817 is typically sensitive to the peculiar motion of the host galaxy due to local dynamics. Previous measurements from this event have taken advantage of peculiar velocity measurements of nearby galaxies, including a handful of objects in the galaxy group that the host of the event, NGC 4993, has been associated with. Still, the group's properties and NGC 4993's membership were debated. We present DESI observations of thousands of galaxies in the vicinity of NGC 4993, resulting in 39 group galaxies and a five-fold increase in galaxies compared to previous observations with many of these galaxies contributing to a peculiar velocity measurement. Examining the local dynamics, our observations support the presence of a galaxy group of which NGC 4993 is part with a halo mass of order $\\sim$$10^{13}~M_\\odot$. Using peculiar velocity measurements from our Fundamental Plane galaxies observations, we find $H_0 =70.9^{+6.4}_{-8.5}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. In addition, using a peculiar velocity measurement for NGC 4993 from Surface Brightness Fluctuations in Cosmicflows-4 we find $H_0 =73.4^{+3.3}_{-3.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We study the impact of different galaxy selection criteria on the determination of the peculiar velocity and, in turn, on the $H_0$ measurement. Our results highlight the importance of multiplexed spectroscopic observations of the environments of gravitational wave events to probe local dynamics, which can ultimately affect standard siren measurements.",

In this paper, we present multiwavelength results for one of the targets, the nearby high-mass star-forming region W40. Using dense-gas tracers C$^{18}$O(1--0) and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1--0), we identified six velocity-coherent filaments: five at \\vlsr $\\sim$\\,7.5\\kms\\! and one at \\vlsr $\\sim$\\,5\\kms. Four of these converge towards an infrared-bright cluster hosting the most massive star of the region (IRS 1A South, O9.5V), forming a hub-filament system (HFS). Key physical parameters, including filament lengths, widths, masses, velocity dispersions, and line masses, are derived. Five dense clumps traced by N$_2$H$^+$(1--0) exhibit subsonic to transonic turbulence, contrasting with the supersonic motions of their parental filaments, indicating turbulence dissipation. A deficit of emission at \\vlsr $\\sim$\\,7\\kms\\! in several molecular lines, along with a blueshifted absorption dip in the HCN(1--0) profile, suggests that emission from OB-heated gas is being absorbed by a cold foreground cloud. A bridge-like feature in position-velocity space connects the \\vlsr $\\sim$\\,5 and $\\sim$\\,7.5\\kms\\! filaments, and spatially coinciding with dense condensations and radio continuum peaks. These findings suggest that a past interaction--likely a cloud-cloud collision--triggered the formation of HFS and ultimately the central massive cluster.",

No bimodality appears in the stellar metallicity-mass relation, which changes from steep to flat across 10^10.8Msun. Similar trends emerge for age and metallicity with velocity dispersion, but with sharper transition from young to old around log(sigma)=2.3. Differences with respect to trens with stellar mass suggest that age primarily depends on velocity dispersion below and above the transition regime, while both stellar mass and velocity dispersion contribute to stellar metallicity.

        "abstract": "Effects of General Relativity are usually neglected in the non-linear evolution of structures, where Newtonian $N$-body simulations are traditionally employed. In the post-Friedmann expansion framework, a weak-field relativistic approximation purpose-built for cosmology, a frame-dragging gravito-magnetic vector potential arises at leading order, sourced by momentum currents, contributing to the metric even if the dynamics of matter fields at this order is Newtonian, and can thus be extracted from $N$-body simulations. Using the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator code on the IllustrisTNG simulations, here we extend previous work in order to compute the power spectrum of this vector potential down to galactic scales. The magnitude of the vector potential is two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by perturbation theory, and is a $1\\% \\sim 0.1\\%$ effect compared to the non-linear Newtonian scalar gravitational potential. In the red-shift range considered here, the gravito-magnetic effect remains subdominant, without showing any enhancement during a particular phase in the evolution of structures, aside from the continuous growth of non-linearity at low redshift. Although this seems to suggest that, within the $\\Lambda$CDM model, no significant gravito-magnetic effects contribute to the non-linear evolution of cosmic structures, i.e. to the dynamics of massive particles, possible observational consequences, e.g. in lensing, deserve further exploration.",

However, very few mid- and late-type B stars with rapid rotation have been demonstrated to be post-interaction products, despite a growing sample of SB1 binaries among stars within this range of spectral types. By considering the currently available information over the entire range of rapidly rotating B-type binaries, we argue that a significant fraction of the mid- and late-type rapid rotators found in binaries are also likely the result of past mass transfer episodes. The observed properties of this sample are compared to the predictions from the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis code (BPASS), with attention given to the expected evolutionary pathways of stripped stars and the stellar and binary properties of both components of post-interaction systems across a range of initial conditions. Prospects for directly detecting and characterizing the stripped cores of the previous mass donors in such systems are described, and the implications for the role of binary interaction in causing rapid rotation are discussed. An accurate description of prevalence of binary interaction, the physics of mass transfer, and the post-interaction configuration of systems over a range of initial conditions has far-reaching implications including double-degenerate binaries and their eventual mergers, the output of ionizing UV flux of stellar populations, and the supernova explosions that can arise from stripped or rapidly-rotating progenitors.",

These measurements provide invaluable information about the properties of cold, catalyzed matter beyond nuclear saturation density. Here we present the results of our modeling of NICER data on PSR J0437$-$4715 using several different models of hot thermal X-ray emitting spots on the stellar surface. For this pulsar, previous Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations established that there is also a modulated nonthermal component to the emission, but the previously published analysis of NICER data did not model this component. We find that the Bayesian evidence is significantly higher when the modulated nonthermal component is included, and that omission of this component leads to poor fits to the bolometric NICER data and thus risks bias in the resulting radius estimates. Our models, which we pursue to inferential convergence, therefore have modulated nonthermal emission, and our headline model has in addition three uniform-temperature thermally-emitting circular spots. Using this model, the symmetric 68% credible range in the radius is 11.8 km to 15.1 km, which at the independently-measured mass of $M=1.418\\pm 0.044~M_\\odot$ is consistent with previous reports of the radius of the $\\sim 1.4~M_\\odot$ pulsar PSR J0030$+$0451.

        "abstract": "We have computed the physical processes involved in a head-on collision between a neutron star (NS) and a white dwarf (WD). The outcomes of such collisions vary depending on the mass and type of the WD. We have separately examined the dynamical processes for collisions between NSs and helium WDs (He-WDs), carbon-oxygen WDs (CO-WDs), and oxygen-neon WDs (ONe-WDs). We aim to investigate whether the collision can trigger a thermonuclear explosion of the WD, and if not, whether the NS can remain bound within the WD to form a Thorne-Zytkow-like object (TZlO). For a thermonuclear explosion to occur, at least two conditions must be satisfied: (i) the collision-induced temperature must reach the ignition threshold of the relevant nuclear reactions, and (ii) the burning material must remain in a degenerate state. For different types of WDs, there exist parameter ranges where both conditions are fulfilled, implying that NS-WD collisions can indeed induce thermonuclear explosions, leading to sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernovae or other exotic optical transients powered by thermonuclear explosion. On the other hand, the formation of a TZlO requires that the WD material exerts sufficient drag on the NS to prevent its escape, while the interaction must not trigger a thermonuclear explosion of the WD. Our results indicate that such conditions can be realized in the case of low-mass CO-WDs and low-mass ONe-WDs, provided that the viscous coefficient is sufficiently large.",

        "abstract": "An accurate characterisation of the physical properties of galaxies at cosmic dawn is key to understanding the origin of the high abundance of UV-bright galaxies at z$\\gtrsim$10. We exploit deep NIRSpec PRISM observations of GHZ2 to constrain the sources of ionising radiation and the properties of the ISM in this bright, compact, and highly ionising galaxy at z=12.3. We measure with high significance the prominent N IV, C IV, He II, O III, C III, O II, and Ne III emission features previously detected in shallower observations, and confirm the detection of the N III] $\\lambda 1750$ multiplet, yielding tight constraints on the N/O ratio, which is found to be $\\simeq$2 times the solar value. We also detect the Mg II $\\lambda 2800$, [Fe IV] $\\lambda 2833$ and Si II $\\lambda 1812$ doublets, the H8+HeI $\\lambda\\lambda 3889$ blend, and the Si IV+O IV] $\\lambda\\lambda 1400$ absorption complex. The O III $\\lambda 3133$ fluorescence line is only detected in the first observing epoch, implying variability on a rest-frame time span of 19 days, strongly suggesting the presence of an active nucleus. Combining the NIRSpec dataset with available optical and far-infrared constraints from MIRI and ALMA, we show that the emission spectrum of GHZ2 cannot be reproduced by single-density spectro-photometric models. Multi-zone photoionisation modelling performed with the HOMERUN code demonstrates that star formation must be occurring in a strongly stratified ISM, where both low-/intermediate-density gas and high-density regions (log($n_e$/cm$^{-3}) \\gtrsim 4$) coexist. The GHZ2 emission landscape is consistent with either a composite star-formation plus AGN scenario, or with star formation occurring in a combination of radiation- and matter-bounded regions. Purely radiation-bounded stellar models fail to reproduce the observed He II emission, making an additional hard ionising component unavoidable.",

Therefore, transiting brown dwarfs are a testbed for the interior and evolutionary models of brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets. We have developed atmospheric and evolutionary models for this emerging population. We show that intense stellar irradiation can cause a large enhancement in the radius of transiting brown dwarfs at all masses, especially if the incident flux exceeds $log_{10}(F/cgs)\\ge$9 ($T_{\\rm eq}\\ge 1450$ K). Stellar irradiation can significantly alter rates of nuclear burning in irradiated brown dwarfs, making the Deuterium-burning and Hydrogen-burning minimum masses strong functions of incident stellar flux. We show that the D-burning and H-burning minimum masses can decrease by 16% and 13%, respectively, between isolated and strongly irradiated brown dwarfs ( $log_{10}(F/cgs)\\ge$10 ($T_{\\rm eq}\\ge 2570$ K)). This shows that stellar irradiation has a larger impact on the planet-brown dwarf-star mass boundaries than metallicity or clouds. We show that metal cores or migration affect their evolution to a much lesser extent, whereas low mass highly irradiated old sources can help us test the physics of hot Jupiter radius anomaly. We fit the observed radii of 46 transiting brown dwarfs and show that our irradiated evolutionary models fit their radii better than models that ignore the host star, especially for highly irradiated objects. However, the measured radii of 10 objects are still inconsistent at $>3\\sigma$ level, indicating residual gaps in our irradiated evolutionary model.",

However, a growing discrepancy between measurements of the expansion rate $H_0$ from the near and distant Universe now appears to be significant at the ~4-7 $\\sigma$ level. This inconsistency, known as the ``Hubble tension'', has arisen either due to unrecognized systematics in these measurements or new physics beyond the standard model, such as an evolving dark energy equation of state. Modeling ~20-year, multi-band optical light curves for 6992 active galactic nuclei (AGN), we find a tight relation linking the variability amplitude and characteristic timescale to their intrinsic luminosity. This empirical law enables us to construct an AGN-based Hubble diagram to z ~3.5.

A semi-supervised machine learning approach with an autoencoder model is built to identify ultracool dwarfs with the simulated CSST spectra, which demonstrates the capability of the CSST all-sky slitless spectroscopic survey on the detection of ultracool dwarfs. Magnetic activity of the ultracool dwarfs is investigated by using the H$\\alpha$ line emission as a proxy. The rotational periods of 82 ultracool dwarfs are derived based on the Kepler/K2 light curves.

Rubin Observatory has now seen first light, and over a 10 year duration, LSST is projected to catalogue tens of millions of quasars, many of which are expected to be associated with sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Out of these SMBHBs, up to thousands of relatively massive binary-quasars are expected to exhibit gravitational self-lensing flares (SLFs) that last for at least 20-30 days. We assess the effectiveness of the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram and matched filters (MFs) as methods for systematic searches for these binaries, using toy-models of hydrodynamical, Doppler, and self-lensing variability from equal-mass, eccentric SMBHBs. We inject SLFs into random realizations of damped random walk (DRW) lightcurves, representing stochastic quasar variability, and compute the LS periodogram with and without the SLF. We find that periodograms of SLF+DRW light-curves do not have maximum peak heights that could not arise from DRW-only periodograms. On the other hand, the matched filter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can distinguish SLFs from noise even with LSST-like cadences and DRW noise. Furthermore, we develop a three-step procedure with matched filters, which can also recover injected binary parameters from these light-curves. We expect this method to be computationally efficient enough to be applicable to millions of quasar light-curves in LSST.",

        "abstract": "We present new two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of supernova shock breakout from red supergiants using the $\\texttt{CASTRO}$ code. Our progenitors are 20 and 25 M$_{\\odot}$ solar-metallicity stars evolved from the zero-age main sequence with $\\texttt{MESA}$ and exploded in one dimension using $\\texttt{FLASH}$. We consider a range of circumstellar media (CSM) produced by stellar winds to investigate how pre-explosion mass-loss affects shock breakout. The multigroup flux-limited diffusion scheme in $\\texttt{CASTRO}$ captures the interaction between the explosion shock, its radiation precursor, and the surrounding CSM. We find that strong radiation precursors, generated by radiation leakage behind the shock, can drive fluid instabilities and move the effective photosphere outward before the shock reaches the stellar surface. The resulting breakout emissions reach peak luminosities of ${\\sim}10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ with full-width half-maximum durations of 1-3 hr, which are much dimmer and longer than those from blue supergiants. The light-curve colors gradually evolve from blue to red after the peak. The 25 M$_{\\odot}$ model with explosion energy $E \\sim 1.69\\times10^{51}$ erg produces ${\\sim}$10-30\\% higher maximum luminosity than the 20 M$_{\\odot}$ model with $E \\sim 1.09\\times10^{51}$ erg.

Therefore, it can provide invaluable information on the fate of clouds, and the sites of star formation. Our objective was to study the accuracy with which we can measure the true mass-to-flux ratio in molecular clouds under various projection angles and identify systematic biases. We used a 3D nonideal magnetohydrodynamic chemo-dynamical simulation of a turbulent collapsing molecular cloud. We quantified the accuracy with which the mass-to-flux ratio is recovered under various projection angles and dynamical stages by analyzing the magnetic field - gas column density relation, and comparing the \"observed\" mass-to-flux ratio against the true values. We find that projection effects have a major effect on measurements of the mass-to-flux ratio. Zeeman measurements can overestimate the true mass-to-flux ratio of the cloud by more than an order of magnitude when the magnetic field primarily lies on the plane of the sky. Therefore, measurements of the mass-to-flux ratio based on Zeeman observations should be considered as upper limits. Mass-to-flux ratio estimates inferred from polarization observations do not provide a physically meaningful probe of the true mass-to-flux ratio and can lead to unphysical results as they fail to capture the underlying correlation between the magnetic field and column density.",

We recover a best-fit scenario in which the bulge forms through an early, rapid starburst (t1 ~ 0.1Gyr, tau1 ~ 0.09Gyr, star-formation efficiency (SFE) ~ 3Gyr^-1 followed by a delayed, lower mass second infall (t2 ~ 5.1Gyr, tau2 ~ 1.7Gyr, sigma2 ~ 0.69). Our model adopts mass- and metallicity-dependent nucleosynthetic yields from modern stellar grids and explores a wide GCE parameter space in infall timing, star formation efficiency, mass partitioning, IMF upper mass, and SN Ia normalization, optimized via a hybrid genetic algorithm with MCMC refinement. The later infall features a reduced star formation efficiency (Delta SFE ~ 0.72), reproducing the metal-rich peak of the bulge metallicity distribution function (MDF) and the decline in [alpha/Fe] at high [Fe/H]. Our model naturally favors the Joyce et al. (2023) age--metallicity relation over the ages in Bensby et al. (2017). Degeneracy and principal component analysis show that the infall history, SFE, and mass partitioning are strongly covariant -- the bulge's observed MDF, abundance trends, and age distribution constrain only their combinations, not each parameter independently. The results support a composite bulge origin -- a classical collapse builds the majority of the mass, while a younger component is required to match the late stage enrichment.",

        "abstract": "The Dark Ages (DA) provides a crucial window into the physics of the infant Universe, with the 21-cm signal offering the only direct probe for mapping out the three-dimensional distribution of matter at this epoch. To measure this cosmological signal, the Dark-ages EXplorer (DEX) has been proposed as a compact, grid-based radio array on the lunar farside. The minimal design consists of a 32 $\\times$ 32 array of 3-m dipole antennas, operating in the $7 - 50$ MHz band. A practical challenge on the lunar surface is that the antennas may get displaced from their intended positions due to deployment imprecisions and non-coplanarity arising from local surface undulations. We present, for the first time, an end-to-end simulation pipeline, called SPADE-21cm, that integrates a sky model with a DA 21-cm signal model simulated in the lunar frame and incorporating lunar topography data. We study the effects of both lateral (xy) and vertical (z) offsets on the two-dimensional power spectra across the $7 - 12$ MHz and $30 - 35$ MHz spectral windows, with tolerance thresholds derived only for the latter. Our results show that positional offsets bias the power spectrum by $10 - 30$ per cent relative to the expected 21-cm power spectrum during DA. Lateral offsets within $\\sigma_{xy}/\\lambda \\lesssim 0.027$ (at 32.5 MHz) keep the fraction of Fourier modes with strong contamination (> 50 per cent of the signal) to less than 1 per cent, whereas vertical height offsets affect a larger fraction.

        "abstract": "We present the first data release (DR1) of the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey, a mapping in the J=(1-0) transition lines of 12CO, 13CO, and C18O toward the northern Galactic plane during 2011-2022. The MWISP survey was conducted using the PMO 13.7 m telescope at a spatial resolution of approximately 50\" and a velocity resolution of 0.16 km/s at 115 GHz. DR1 fully covered 2310 square degrees within the Galactic longitude (l) and latitude (b) range of 9.75 deg =< l=< 229.75 deg and |b| =< 5.25 deg. The surveyed area was divided into cell units of 30'x30' for practical purposes and On-The-Fly (OTF) mapping was performed toward each target cell unit. The data were regridded into a regular 3D datacube in l-b-V_LSR with a pixel size of 30\" in l-b axes and 0.16 km/s in theV_LSR axis. The median rms noise is 0.47 K, 0.25 K, and 0.25 K for 12CO, 13CO, and C18O, respectively. The equivalent 3 sigma sensitivity in 12CO luminosity is approximately 0.23 K km/s, making MWISP the most sensitive survey of its kind. In this paper, we describe the survey data, including the calibration, data cleaning, data mosaic processes, and the data products. The final mosaicked data cubes contain about 3.33x10^7 spectra (pixels) for each CO isotopologue line. Color composite images, made from the intensities of the isotopologue lines, and some concise descriptions are provided. We constructed a molecular cloud catalog based on the mosaicked 12CO data cube using the clustering algorithm DBSCAN, detecting 103,517 molecular clouds, 10,790 of which exhibit 13CO emission and 304 of which show C18O emission. Based on the histogram of voxel brightness temperature, we estimated a total 12CO flux of 7.69+/-0.38x10^7 K km/s arcmin^2, 82% of which is captured by the DBSCAN algorithm. The data, together with the cloud sample, provide unique information on molecular gas in the northern Milky Way.",

        "abstract": "Giant radio galaxies (GRGs) represent the largest individual astrophysical structures, rivalling galaxy clusters in physical extent. Understanding how they attain such scales demands examining their large scale cosmic surroundings, particularly the under explored filament environment. We quantify the three dimensional (3D) distance of GRGs from the nearest filament spine; test how this distance correlates with their growth and formation of different morphological classes; assess whether their radio jets exhibit preferred orientations relative to filament axes; and examine how filament anisotropy from spine to periphery modulates radio morphology. We employed a filament catalogue from the SDSS together with the largest GRG catalogue currently available. For each source, we measured the comoving distance to the nearest filament spine, the projected jet spine orientation angle, and quantified lobe asymmetry via the arm length ratio (ALR). These metrics trace proximity, directionality, and the impact of filamentary environment on morphology. We then compared GRGs with a control sample of small radio galaxies (SRGs) to constrain the environmental factors that regulate the attainment of giant sizes. We validated the robustness of our results via bootstrap resampling and non parametric statistical tests. Our results show that GRGs and SRGs have similar filament occupancy. By contrast, GRGs preferentially display larger alignment angles relative to filament spines, while SRG orientations are consistent with a random distribution. GRGs further show enhanced morphological asymmetry, reflected in lower ALR values than SRGs. Attainment of giant sizes is not governed by proximity to filaments; rather, it correlates with jet filament alignment. Abridged.",

Focusing on the single exchange of a massive scalar field, we demonstrate that the trispectrum splits cleanly into its local and non-local components once the heavy-field propagators are decomposed in the Keldysh basis. Integrating out the massive degree of freedom yields a single-field effective field theory for the light scalar that necessarily contains both unitary operators and non-unitary contributions associated with dissipation and stochastic noise. We show that the leading local signal in parity-preserving theories arises from the unitary part of this effective field theory, whereas the non-local signal is intrinsically associated with its stochastic sector. The effective field theory coefficients themselves are a priori non-analytic in the external kinematics; however, this non-analyticity can be softened when a scale hierarchy - such as the heavy-mass expansion - is imposed, up to spurious contributions that ultimately cancel in observables. Finally, we establish a connection between the cosmological collider signal and entropy production, linking the observable non-local signal to intrinsic properties of the quantum state, including its degree of mixedness.",

        "abstract": "Black holes, the simplest solution to Einstein's field equations, do not emit light, making their observations a major challenge for researchers. However, discovery of binary black holes (BBHs) in 2015 by LIGO has transformed the study of compact objects, with over 300 BBHs recorded, providing a new avenue for probing new physics. GWs remain a prominent and precise method of observing not only BBHs, but also dark matter and cosmic strings. Cosmic strings -- hypothetical one dimensional topological defects formed in the early universe, are yet to be observed, with multiple detection methods such as particle radiation, gravitational waves and lensing being proposed. Here we present a novel framework to search for cosmic strings by modeling them as perturbations within non-rotating black hole spacetime, focusing on their imprint on the spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our numerical simulations identify a lower limit on perturbation strength, $\\lambda \\sim 10^{-10}$ for uncharged string and $\\lambda \\sim 10^{-7}$ for charged string, below which cosmic string effects become unobservable in QNM signals. By analyzing eigenvalue splitting and centers, we show that cosmic string properties impart distinct and detectable features to GW signals. Our results establish QNM analysis as a powerful, alternative observational strategy for constraining or detecting cosmic strings, and offer an inverse approach to estimate string energy or charge if a signal is detected. With upgrades in LIGO technologies and advanced multimessenger astronomy under development, these findings highlight new potential for detecting cosmic strings.",

        "abstract": "Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright millisecond radio pulses. Their origin is still unknown in the field of astronomy. A notable distinction among FRBs is that some sources repeat, while others appear to be non-repeating events. Interestingly, repeating FRBs tend to exhibit broader temporal widths and narrower spectral bandwidths compared to non-repeat events, suggesting they may arise from different physical mechanisms. However, current radio telescopes have limited coverage and sensitivity, which hinders a complete survey with continuous long-term monitoring. This issue makes it difficult to confirm repeat activity and potentially leads to misclassification of repeaters as non- repeaters; these are referred to as repeater candidates. To address this, machine learning techniques have emerged as a useful tool for classifying distinct FRB types in previous studies. In this study, we utilize the CHIME/FRB baseband catalog with three orders of magnitude better time resolution than the intensity catalog. Measured fluences are available in the baseband catalog, while only upper limits are reported in the intensity catalog. We apply machine learning to the baseband catalog to evaluate classification outcomes. We identify 15 repeater candidates among 122 non-repeating FRBs in the baseband catalog. Additionally, our classification identifies 31 sources previously categorized as repeater candidates as non-repeaters, highlighting a significant difference from the prior work. Of these repeater candidates, 14 overlap with previous findings, while 1 is newly identified in this work. Notably, one of our candidates was confirmed as a repeater by CHIME/FRB. Follow-up observations for the 14 candidates are highly encouraged.",

        "abstract": "Dark photons, a generic class of light gauge bosons that interact with the Standard Model (SM) exclusively through kinetic mixing, arise naturally in many gauge extensions of the SM. Motivated by these theoretical considerations, we present a comprehensive analysis of their thermal production in the early universe. Our calculation covers a broad range of dark photon masses from 0.1 keV to 100 MeV and include inverse decay, annihilation, and semi-Compton processes. Wherever possible, we present analytical estimates of the production rates and yields, and verify their accuracy numerically. For dark photons lighter than twice the electron masses (around 1 MeV), we find that our analytical estimate of the freeze-in yield based on resonant production is very accurate, implying that off-resonance contributions can be neglected in practice. For heavy dark photons, although this conclusion no longer holds, we derive an interesting ratio, $4\\pi e/27\\approx0.14$, with $e$ the coupling constant of QED, that can be used to estimate the relative importance of on- and off-resonance contributions. Finally, using the calculated abundance of dark photons in the early universe, we derive cosmological constraints on the dark photon mass and kinetic mixing. Compared with bounds from stellar cooling and supernovae, the cosmological constraints are most stringent in the mass range from 0.1 MeV to 6 MeV, within which kinetic mixing at the level of $10^{-12}\\sim10^{-10}$ can be probed.",

We present a first study of the lensing signature of a massive black hole (MBH) on a frequency-dependent GW signal from a moving binary merger. For both light and GW sources in a Keplerian circular orbit around a MBH lens, the self-lensing geometry breaks the microlensing degeneracy in the Einstein radius crossing timescale $t_{\\rm E}$. The duration of the curve ($2 t_{\\rm E}$) becomes independent on the MBH mass $M_{\\rm MBH}$, and provides a direct measure of the distance $d_{\\rm LS}$ to the MBH. However, $M_{\\rm MBH}$ remains unknown. We show that, in GW signals, the redshifted mass $M_{{\\rm MBH},z}$ can additionally be obtained from the interference pattern, by measuring the modulation period $T$, the GW frequency $f$, and $t_{\\rm E}$: $M_{{\\rm MBH},z}\\simeq 2.5\\times 10^6\\,M_\\odot\\,(t_{\\rm E}/[100\\,{\\rm s}])\\,(f\\,T)^{-1}$. If this lensing signature is not considered, it may be confused with other waveform distortions, especially in the modeling of overlapping signals in next generation ground-based GW detectors. The observation of one of these curves and its associated parameters may help (1) constrain the orbital distance $d_{\\rm LS}$ of sources, especially around low mass MBHs at the centers of star clusters and galaxies, (2) additionally estimate the mass $M_{{\\rm MBH},z}$ of these MBHs, and (3) infer the orbital inclination of the binary.

Although several sources show ~100 TeV gamma rays, their hadronic origin is uncertain; a matching neutrino signal would provide definitive evidence. Using insight from the theory of diffusive shock acceleration, we evaluate the spectra and environments of the sample of Galactic SNRs to identify those most likely to be hadronic, categorizing them into a tiered catalog depending on their likelihood to produce neutrinos detectable in the TeV-PeV range. We then calculate the estimated stacked sensitivity of IceCube for each tier using IceCube's ten-year public data. Our results suggest that this strategy of stacking SNRs and carefully excluding leptonic sources by using theoretical arguments may allow for a detection of this source class that would otherwise be impossible. A follow-up analysis of these catalogs using TeV-PeV sensitive neutrino data from IceCube (or similar telescopes like KM3NeT/ARCA) offers the most decisive, near-future test for the hadronic nature of these SNRs and the maximum energies of their CR spectra.",

        "abstract": "Gravitational waves (GWs) are powerful probes of new physics in the early Universe. In particular, GWs induced by primordial isocurvature perturbations encode information of novel dynamics beyond the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. Existing studies of isocurvature induced GWs focus on a particular type: cold dark matter (CDM) isocurvature. In this work, we present a more comprehensive study of four kinds of isocurvature involving CDM, baryons, neutrinos and free-streaming dark radiation (DR). We first reformulate initial conditions of isocurvature with coupled neutrinos because modes relevant for observations at Pulsar Timing Arrays enter the horizon before neutrino decoupling. With these new initial conditions, neutrino isocurvature is phenomenologically similar to CDM isocurvature up to an overall coefficient, which leads to an interesting conversion of isocurvature between radiation and matter sectors. We then find that the spectrum of isocurvature induced GWs from free-streaming DR is qualitatively different than that from CDM due to the presence of anisotropic stress. Unlike GWs induced by CDM isocurvature that are suppressed at high frequencies due to matter density being suppressed at early times, DR isocurvature induced GWs is proportional to the constant ratio between DR density and total radiation. Finally, we utilize two general parametrizations of the isocurvature power spectrum: a delta function and a broken power law, and derive novel constraints with recent NANOGrav data. Our results set stringent constraints on isocurvature around $10^{6}\\,\\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, which are complementary to cosmological observations at large scales.",

Significant progress has been made in constraining what fraction of SNe Ic-BL may power high- or low-luminosity GRBs when viewed at small off-axis angles. However, the GRB-SN connection still lacks a complete understanding in the broader context of massive-star evolution and explosion physics. Models predict a continuum of outcomes for the fastest ejecta, from choked to ultra-relativistic jets, and observations from radio to X-rays are key to probing these scenarios across a range of viewing angles and velocities. Here, we present results from a coordinated radio-to-X-ray campaign targeting nearby (z<=0.1) SNe Ic-BL designed to explore this diversity. With eight new radio-monitored events and updated data for one previously observed SN, we further tighten constraints on the fraction of SNe Ic-BL as relativistic as SN 1998bw/GRB 980425. We identify SN 2024rjw as a new radio-loud event likely powered by strong interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), and add evidence supporting a similar interpretation for SN 2020jqm. We also establish new limits on the properties of radio-emitting ejecta with velocities consistent with cocoons from choked jets, highlighting SN 2022xxf as a promising cocoon-dominated candidate. These results refine our understanding of the continuum linking ordinary SNe Ic-BL, engine-driven explosions, and GRBs, and contribute to building a sample that will inform future multi-messenger searches for electromagnetic counterparts to high-energy neutrinos.",

Such an interaction can be radiatively generated if dark matter couples to heavier charged particles.

Here, we instead consider the possibility that these heavy states have masses comparable to the dark matter mass and are charged under a new kinetically-mixed $U(1)'$. As a result, dark matter production is dominated by the infrared freeze-in of the heavy charged states that subsequently thermalize the rest of the dark sector to a temperature much below that of the visible bath. We delineate regions of parameter space consistent with cosmological and astrophysical constraints and identify benchmark scenarios that can guide the next generation of direct detection experiments searching for spin-dependent scattering of sub-GeV dark matter.",

        "abstract": "Most circumbinary planets have been discovered by their transits, limiting our understanding of such systems to those with mutually coplanar architectures. This bias makes it difficult to infer the true circumbinary planet population, highlighting the need for alternative detection methods that do not rely on transits. In this work, we explore one such approach by leveraging apsidal precession as a dynamical signature of planetary companions. We analyse TESS photometry of a sample of 1,590 eclipsing binaries from the Gaia DR3 Catalogue of Eclipsing Binary Candidates to identify systems exhibiting detectable apsidal precession. We rule general relativistic, tidal, and rotational contributions as insufficient to account for the measured apsidal precession, demonstrating that an additional gravitational perturber is required. This enables us to constrain the possible masses and orbital separations of a companion that would cause the observed precession. We present a new set of 27 candidate circumbinary planets identified through this precession-based method as well as 6 candidate companions with a higher minimum mass. Their inferred properties remain degenerate, as the same dynamical signatures can arise from lower-mass planets at less than 1 AU or from more massive companions on wider, few-AU orbits, reflecting the current uncertainty in characterising these systems. Radial velocities can help break this degeneracy and provide direct confirmation.",

        "abstract": "We present an all-sky map of the synchrotron spectral index and curvature between 45 and 2300 MHz at a resolution of 1 degree calculated from a combination of numerous partial sky empirical measurements. We employ a least-squares parametric fit which relies on removing a free-free emission template and a component separation technique which fits for both synchrotron and free-free emission. We compare our diffuse sky model estimates against those derived from the models widely used in the community (e.g. pysm3 and GSM) employing external datasets that were not included in the estimation process. Our evaluation focuses on identifying the enhanced consistency at both the map level and in pixel-to-pixel correlations, allowing for a more robust verification of our model's performance. We find our parametric, least-squares synchrotron estimate to be the most reliable across radio frequencies as it consistently provides sky models with average accuracies (when compared to empirical data) of around 20 per cent, whilst other model performances range on average between 10 and 70 per cent accurate. The results obtained have been made publicly accessible online and can be utilized to further develop and refine models of Galactic synchrotron emission.",

        "abstract": "We present a detailed, time-resolved analysis of the Fe K band of the Seyfert 1.5 galaxy NGC 3516 observed with XRISM. The 249 ks observation spanning $\\sim$310 ks in elapsed time reveals an exceptionally rich and time-variable absorption spectrum. Six distinct absorption components are detected across multiple ionization states, spanning more than an order of magnitude in ionization parameter and a wide range of systemic velocities, from a potential inflow ($+4300~\\rm km~s^{-1}$) to a mildly relativistic ultra-fast outflow ($-9800~\\rm km~s^{-1}$). Despite their diversity, the components exhibit relatively small broadening ($\\lesssim$$400~\\rm km~s^{-1}$), implying comparable internal dynamics within a medium of a complex structure. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals pronounced variability in three highly ionized absorbers, with Fe XXV$-$Fe XXVI features that appear and disappear on timescales of tens of kiloseconds. This behavior likely reflects a combination of geometrical transits of clumpy gas and ionization-state changes driven by continuum variability. An additional temporary absorption feature in the red wing of the Fe K$\\alpha$ line, consistent with Fe XXV absorption, indicates a possible transient ultra-fast inflow at $\\sim$$15\\,000~\\rm km~s^{-1}$ ($\\sim$5% $c$). Finally, the continuum light curve exhibits a tentative $\\sim$40 ks oscillatory pattern, accompanied by correlated shifts of a weak, narrow Fe K$\\alpha$ emission feature, suggesting dynamic coupling between the continuum and the line-emitting region. Together, these results reveal that the nuclear environment of NGC 3516 is dominated by rapidly evolving, multi-phase gas flows, where accretion, ejection, and ionization processes are tightly coupled on sub-parsec scales.",

The global minimum variance (GMV) quadratic estimator for CMB lensing reduces reconstruction noise over the standard quadratic estimator (SQE).

Our approach employs Bayesian analysis to study this phenomenon. Hadronic matter is modeled using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) approximation, for which we have selected two parameter sets: \\(NL3^{*}\\omega\\rho\\), representing hadronic matter with nucleons only, and $EL3\\omega\\rho$ with nucleons only and $EL3\\omega\\rho Y$, which includes hyperons. On the other hand deconfined quark matter is modeled using the vector-MIT bag model. For our purpose, the phase transition is implemented using the Maxwell construction. Bayesian inference is performed by tuning three parameters: the bag constant (i.e. $B^{1/4}$), the vector coupling constant \\(\\left(G_{v}\\right)\\), and the Dirac sea contribution ($b_{4}$). We found that a phase transition could exist at densities below \\(2.0\\,n_{0}\\) for both the $EL3\\omega\\rho - EL3\\omega\\rho Y $ and $NL3^{*}\\omega\\rho$ parametrizations. As a consequence, our results also indicate that a hybrid neutron star could have a large quark core that comprises more than \\(80\\%\\) of its size.",

This fraction, when combined with information about the neutron star mass distribution gleaned from the inspiral portion of the signals, provides an indirect measure of the neutron star maximum mass. Using conservative measures of the post-merger waveforms, we show that 50-70 events with binary neutron star inspiral measurements can be combined to give an $11-20\\%$ fractional uncertainty on the maximum mass of rapidly rotating, hot neutron stars, which can potentially be turned into a $12-21\\%$ fractional constraint on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff mass.

Previous analyses of the KM3-230213A event relied on simplified survival-probability estimates and, in some cases, used inaccurate decay-width expressions or neglected redshift and threshold effects. In this work we present a unified and self-consistent framework that corrects these issues and applies to both the energy-independent ($n=0$) and quadratic ($n=2$) superluminal cases. We collect and recast the decay-width and threshold expressions, clarify their flavor dependence, and include a consistent treatment of cosmological propagation. We also assess the impact of cascade regeneration and show that cascade effects are negligible for the purpose of setting LIV bounds. The survival-probability approximation adopted in previous works is therefore justified, while our framework provides a coherent basis for future analyses of superluminal neutrino constraints, which should consistently include possible time-delay signatures.",

Using these observations, we studied their morphology, multiplicity and radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Across our target regions, we resolve multiple compact sources and report eight new detections, four of which are entirely new and four that have counterparts at other wavelengths, but are detected here for the first time at radio frequencies. Based on radio morphologies and spectral indices, we assess the nature of the detected sources, highlighting seven that display jet-like structures and spectral indices consistent with ionized jets. Combining our results with the SOMA Radio I and II results, we expand the overall sample to 29 protostars, covering a bolometric luminosity range from $L_{\\rm bol}\\sim 10^2$ to $10^6\\:L_\\odot$. These sources help define a potential evolutionary sequence in the radio versus bolometric luminosity diagram. IM protostars have radio luminosities that are lower than expected from a simple power law extrapolation from low-mass protostars. However, this result is consistent with theoretical expectations from protostellar evolution models, which show low levels of photoionization and reduced shock ionization emission due to expanded stellar radii during this phase. Overall our expanded SOMA Radio sample provides new constraints on theoretical models of massive protostellar evolution, especially the connection to ionized gas structures.",

This event is synchronized with the sharp decay, within less than half a day, of a prominent soft X-ray/UV flare. Accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the XRISM Resolve data alone indicate a low probability of 2e-5 that this UFO detection is due to random chance. The UFO features narrow H-like and He-like Fe lines with a velocity dispersion of 1000 km/s, suggesting that it originates from a dense clump. Beyond this primary detection, there are hints of weaker outflow signatures throughout the rise and fall phases of the soft flare. Their velocities increase from 0.05c to 0.3c over approximately three days, and they may be associated with a larger stream in which the clump is embedded. The radiation pressure is insuffcient to drive the acceleration of this rapidly evolving outflow. The observed evolution of the outflow kinematics instead closely resembles that of solar coronal mass ejections, implying magnetic driving and, conceivably, reconnection near the accretion disk as the likely mechanisms behind both the UFO launch and the associated soft flare.",

        "abstract": "Conventional ground-based optical telescopes, even those with large apertures, primarily observe stars, close binaries, and multiple systems as unresolved point sources through photometric measurements. Spectroscopy can identify multiple stellar components within a system, but both techniques are fundamentally limited in resolving stellar surfaces and providing direct angular separations. Although photometric and spectroscopic observations yield critical information on magnitudes/flux, metallicities, and orbital properties, complementary high-angular-resolution methods are required to constrain additional system characteristics, including angular orbital parameters, model-independent distances, radii, and stellar masses. The limitations of these two methods arise due to the Diffraction Limit of the telescopes and atmospheric turbulence. Speckle Interferometry (SI) is a clever and affordable method for ground-based telescopes to work around atmospheric turbulence. In this work, we utilize the speckle images obtained by the 3.6 m DOT and demonstrate the capability of SI to resolve binary systems, measure their orbital separations, and determine their position angles. For systems with faint companions where conventional analysis fails, we employ Bayesian inference to model speckle patterns and estimate orbital parameters with high precision. These results establish the effective methodology for using a medium-sized, 4-m class telescope like the DOT as a high-resolution stellar interferometer and demonstrate the potential of speckle interferometry as a powerful technique to advance optical interferometric studies within Indian astronomy.",

We explore the possibility that this dynamical instability was triggered by the close passage of a star or substellar object during the Sun's embedded cluster phase. We run N-body simulations starting with the giant planets in a resonant chain and an outer planetesimal disk, with a wide-enough planet-disk separation to preserve the planets' orbital stability for $>$100 Myr. We subject the system to a single flyby, testing a wide range in flyby mass, velocity and closest approach distance. We find a variety of outcomes, from flybys that over-excite the system (or strip the planets entirely) to flybys too weak to perturb the planets at all. An intermediate range of flybys triggers a dynamical instability that matches the present-day Solar System. Successful simulations -- that match the giant planets' orbits without over-exciting the cold classical Kuiper belt -- are characterized by the flyby of a substellar object ($3-30 M_{Jup}$) passing within 20 au of the Sun. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of the Sun's birth cluster phase, parameterized by the product of the stellar density $\\eta$ and the cluster lifetime $T$.

This radio-power--size--age diagram shows an interesting predominance of candidate remnant radio-galaxies (SCI > 0.15) with D < 200 kpc (although these may instead be young radio-sources), and a vast range of linear sizes for candidate restarted radio-galaxies (SCI < -0.15).

Recent work has shown that shallow two-pion bound states significantly affect the freeze-out, but did not establish whether such states actually form. In this work we demonstrate that a scalar isosinglet bound state does exist in a well-defined region of parameter space by solving an on-shell Lippmann--Schwinger equation in a chiral-unitary framework and analyzing the $S$-wave $\\pi\\pi$ amplitude in the complex energy plane. We determine the range of $m_\\pi/f_\\pi$ for which a pole appears below the two-pion threshold, extract the corresponding residue, and, in the non-relativistic limit, obtain the bound-state wave function at the origin, $|\\Psi(0)|$, which controls bound-state-assisted annihilation and decay rates relevant for catalyzed freeze-out. Comparing this T-matrix based result with variational estimates using simple finite-range potentials, we find agreement within order-one factors for shallow binding. For binding energies of order the freeze-out temperature, $E_B \\sim m_\\pi/20$, we obtain $|\\Psi(0)|\\sim \\mathcal{O}(0.1)\\,m_\\pi^{3/2}$, thereby supporting the parametric assumptions used in previous phenomenological analyses.",

Early X-ray follow-up revealed a spin period P~3.86 s, a period derivative Pdot~3e-11 s/s, dozens of short bursts, and an unusually flux decline. We report here on the X-ray monitoring of Swift J1555.2-5402 over the first ~29 months of its outburst with Swift, NICER, NuSTAR, INTEGRAL and Insight-HXMT, as well as radio observations with Parkes soon after the outburst onset. The observed 0.3-10 keV flux remained at levels >~1e-11 erg/cm^2/s for nearly 500 days before dropping by a factor of ~10 from its June 2021 peak towards the end of the monitoring campaign. During this time span, the spectrum was dominated by a single blackbody, with temperature attaining approximately a constant value (~1.2 keV) while the inferred radius shrank from ~1.7 km to ~0.3 km (assuming a source distance of 10 kpc). The long-term spin-down rate (Pdot~3.6e-11 s/s) is only ~15 % higher than that measured in the first 30 days. No periodic or burst-like radio emission was detected, in line with what has been previously reported using different radio facilities. The persistently high temperature, shrinking hotspot, and a prolonged bright flux plateau followed by a fast dimming observed during the outburst evolution pose a challenge for the outburst mechanisms proposed so far.",

Here we solve for the full orbital architecture of the bright intermediate-mass nearby system Lambda Ophiuchi based on astrometric measurements of the outer orbit (period of 129 years) compiled in the Sixth Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars and new VLTI/GRAVITY interferometric measurements that are used to determine the inner orbit (period of 42 days). The orbits are retrograde and misaligned by either $88.5\\pm1.9^o$ or $113.5\\pm1.9^o$, which in either case results in the inner binary currently undergoing ZKL oscillations. While pure Newtonian point source evolution would have predicted the stars in the inner binary to have merged long ago, in reality the eccentricity oscillations are significantly modulated by general relativistic, tidal and rotational bulge precession. We show that due to the effect of ``slaved'' precession the dynamics can still be solved semi-analytically. We find that the (currently unknown) inclination angles between the stellar spins axes and the inner orbital axis play a very important role in the amplitude of the ZKL oscillations, which is at a minimum $\\Delta e = e_{\\mathrm{max}} - e_{\\mathrm{min}} \\simeq 0.15$ and could be as high as $\\Delta e \\simeq 0.70$.

Among these, the time lags of Mg II have been successfully determined for 8 of the 18 objects, thereby expanding the current Mg II RM sample, particularly at higher accretion rates. By incorporating measurements of the line widths, we determine the masses of their central supermassive black holes. Based on these new measurements, we update the relation between the Mg II radius and the monochromatic luminosity at 3000 $\\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}$ ($R_{\\rm MgII}-L_{3000}$ relation), yielding a slope of $0.24 \\pm 0.03$, which is slightly shallower than, yet still consistent with, previously reported values. Similar to the H$\\beta$ lines, the Mg II time lags in SEAMBHs are shorter than those of AGNs with normal accretion rates at comparable luminosities. The deviation of AGNs from the best-fit $R_{\\rm MgII}-L_{3000}$ relation shows a strong correlation with the accretion rate, while no significant correlation is found between the deviation and the flux ratio of UV iron to Mg II.",

We leverage the best current measurements of the SMBH accretion distribution, based upon data from nine well-characterized extragalactic fields with a \"wedding-cake\" design, to investigate and quantify the drivers of the drastic decline in cosmic SMBH growth. The decline in the typical Eddington ratio ($\\lambda_\\mathrm{Edd}$) of AGNs (decreasing by $\\approx1.35\\,\\rm dex$ from $z\\approx1.5-2$ to $z\\approx0.2$) is the dominant driver for the broad decline in SMBH growth, rather than a shift of accretion activity to less-massive SMBHs. As $\\lambda_\\mathrm{Edd}$ decreases toward lower redshift, the primary contributor to the cosmic SMBH accretion density ($\\rho_\\mathrm{BHAR}$) has shifted from high-$\\lambda_\\mathrm{Edd}$ AGNs to low-$\\lambda_\\mathrm{Edd}$ AGNs, even though the latter always dominate the comoving AGN number density at $z<4$.

Core-collapse supernovae with strong CSM interaction (Type IIn) are compelling candidates for efficient hadronic acceleration and neutrino production. Aims. We investigate the possible association between the Type IIn supernova SN2025cbj and the IceCube high-energy neutrino IceCube-250421A, and assess whether the observed properties of the SN permit an appreciable neutrino yield. Methods. We combined rapid optical follow-up with LAST and archival ZTF photometry with spectroscopy from LT/SPRAT and MMT/BINOSPEC to characterize the SN evolution and CSM interaction. We estimated the explosion and peak times from early light-curve fitting, and quantified the chance-coincidence probability with resampling simulations that scramble neutrino right ascensions while preserving declinations and error contours. Using a simple post-shock-breakout interaction model in a dense wind, we estimated the expected muon-neutrino yield for IceCube real-time Bronze stream. Results. Spectra of SN2025cbj obtained after the neutrino epoch show persistent narrow Balmer lines superposed on broad Lorentzian electron-scattering wings, consistent with sustained dense-CSM interaction. For the multi-messenger association, resampling simulations against the TNS catalog give a chance-coincidence probability for observing $k \\ge 1$ events of $p \\simeq 0.24$ (and $p \\simeq 0.078$ against the ZTF-BTS catalog). These values are sensitive to the size of the SNe and neutrino samples.

Rubin Observatory, is a wide-field multi-band survey that will revolutionize our understanding of extragalactic sources through its unprecedented combination of area and depth. While the LSST survey strategy is still being finalized, the Rubin Observatory team has generated a series of survey simulations using the LSST Operations Simulator to explore the optimal survey strategy that best accommodates the majority of scientific goals. In this study, we utilize the latest simulated data to predict the number of detectable quasars by LSST in each band and evaluate the impact of different survey strategies. We find that the number of quasars and lower luminosity AGNs detected in the baseline strategy (v4.3.1) in the redshift range z=0.3-6.7 will be highest in the i-band and lowest in the u-band. Over 70% of quasars are expected to be detected within the first year in all bands, as LSST will have already reached the break of the luminosity function at most redshifts. With a limiting magnitude of 25.7 mag, we expect to detect 184 million AGNs in the z-band over the 10-year survey, with quasars constituting only 6% of the total AGNs in each band. This arises because, considering that the luminosities of most low-luminosity AGNs are affected by contamination from their host galaxies, we set a magnitude threshold when predicting the number of quasars. We find that variations in the u-band strategy can impact the number of quasar detections. Specifically, the difference between the baseline strategy and that with the largest total exposure in u is 15%. In contrast, changes in rolling strategies, DDF strategies, weather conditions, and Target of Opportunity observations result in variations below 2%. These results provide valuable insights for optimizing approaches to maximize the scientific output of quasar studies.",

These identifications represent the majority ($\\geq$ 86%) of radio pulsars present in the LoTSS DR2 footprint and provide independent celestial positions and flux densities at 144 MHz. We compare LoTSS flux densities with literature values from various image and time-domain observations and find good agreement for all but two pulsars. We attribute these flux density deviations to intrinsic pulsar properties (nulling and off-pulse emission). We investigate criteria to select promising pulsar candidates using data from the upcoming LoTSS release of the entire Northern sky ($\\delta>0^\\circ$), as well as the LOFAR LBA Sky Survey (LoLSS) at 54 MHz (covering $\\delta>24^\\circ$). Of the 80 detections, 35 (44%) were blindly redetected based on their linear or circular polarization. Therefore we conclude that candidate selection based on polarization properties is a promising approach. Candidate selection can be supplemented with spectral indices via cross-matching to LoLSS sources at 54 MHz, as the high sensitivity of LoTSS is not matched by image-domain surveys at higher frequencies.",

Although the overtone frequencies are a concrete prediction of general relativity, it remains an open question whether they are excited to the extent that fits would suggest. In this work, we take a pragmatic approach and investigate the practical utility of each additional overtone in extracting information from the ringdown. We look at the dependence of the ringdown start time on the number of overtones, and the feasibility of detecting deviations from general relativity in the ringdown frequencies. We suggest that there is no clear \"maximum\" overtone, but rather the utility of each additional overtone decreases compared to the one before. Finally, we perform Bayesian parameter estimation (as opposed to least-squares fits) to obtain posterior distributions on the overtone amplitudes and phases, allowing us to investigate their correlation structure. Due to strong correlations it becomes increasingly hard to measure individual amplitudes and phases for the highest overtones. However, we find that the joint measurement of overtone amplitudes (i.e., the correlation structure itself) is sensitive to the frequencies and decay times of even the highest overtones, possibly offering an avenue to perform consistency tests with general relativity.",

        "abstract": "Interstellar objects such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov offer a unique window into the formation and evolution of other star systems, yet the tracking and analysis of their trajectories remain limited to specialized research institutions. Existing interstellar and solar system datasets are large, complex, and difficult to navigate, reducing accessibility for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts. To address this, we present The Interstellar Signature: a computational framework for open-source interstellar tracking, implemented through a web-based platform.   Interstellar Signature bridges raw astronomical data and an intuitive, developer-friendly interface. The framework integrates live data streams from public repositories and APIs with physics-based simulation methods to model and visualize the motion of interstellar and solar system objects in real time. The platform supports interactive visualizations, comparative orbital analysis, and modular tools that allow users to explore and extend the system for research, experimentation, or development.   As an open-source project, the framework encourages collaboration and hands-on engagement with complex datasets. It exists within NexusCosmos, an ecosystem envisioned as a \"Linux for the space race,\" aimed at democratizing access to space science tools and data. By transforming large datasets into visual, interactive, and customizable simulations, Interstellar Signature expands participation in interstellar research and observation.   Future extensions will add AI-driven trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and advanced visualization. By combining open-source accessibility with computational rigor, this framework lowers the barrier to interstellar analysis and serves as a step toward bridging professional astronomy and public scientific engagement.",

The exact mechanisms that lead to disk formation and dissipation are not fully known although progress has been made with some systems. Here, we present a study of a disk outburst of the southern Be star {\\lambda} Pavonis (HD 173948). Our dataset comprises 698 high-resolution spectra taken contemporaneously with TESS photometry in 2023. During the final days of TESS monitoring, the star began building a disk from a pristine diskless state. We find that the disk built within 5 days in optical H I and He I lines, while the disk is circularized in about 12 days. The disk began to decay in higher energy He I first, then lower energy transitions, with the decay ending last for H{\\alpha}. We examine non-radial pulsations both through TESS photometry and the line profile variations in Balmer lines, He I lines, and the weak photospheric Si III 5739 line. Our analysis indicates that two periodicities seen in TESS photometry (at 1.644 and 1.485 cycles/d) are not seen in the spectral lines before, during, or after the outburst. The strongest spectral signal is a periodicity at 0.163 cycles/d, which appears as a difference between the weaker signals. We additionally find evidence for fast non-photometric pulsational variations over the course of spectroscopy obtained before, during, and after the outburst. These fast LPVs are strong, and interfere with the two weaker signals, causing their apparent incoherence.",

        "abstract": "Radiation-pressure instability was identified soon after the seminal classical accretion disk models of Shakura-Sunyaev and Novikov-Thorne, yet its full implications remain an active area of investigation. These models form the backbone of our understanding of accretion onto compact objects and successfully describe the phenomenology of black hole and neutron star X-ray binaries, as well as luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN), in the regime of high mass accretion rates. At luminosities approaching a significant fraction of the Eddington limit (L/LEdd > 0.1), standard thin disks are predicted to become thermally unstable due to the dominance of radiation pressure. This prediction has found empirical support in several Galactic stellar-mass black hole systems, where the instability manifests as quasi-periodic, large-amplitude luminosity oscillations, so-called \"heartbeat states\", and has been proposed as a driver of observed signatures of deterministic chaos in accretion-driven light curves. The scope of radiation-pressure-induced variability extends beyond stellar-mass black holes: both black holes across mass scales and accreting neutron stars can exhibit related behavior, though the presence of a boundary layer in neutron stars adds complexity and offers a unique laboratory for testing the interplay between accretion dynamics and the central object. On extragalactic scales, the instability has been invoked to explain the duty cycles and apparent short lifetimes of radio-loud AGN, as well as the dramatic spectral-state transitions seen in Changing-Look AGN.

        "abstract": "When a star passes within the Roche limit of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), it is pulled apart by the BH's tidal field in a tidal disruption event (TDE). The resulting flare is powered by the circularization and accretion of bound stellar debris, which initially returns to the BH on eccentric orbits in a thin debris stream. The returning fluid elements follow inclined orbits that converge near pericenter, resulting in extreme vertical compression to scales $10^{-4}~R_\\odot$ and the formation of a nozzle shock. Dissipation at the nozzle shock may affect circularization by altering the properties of the debris stream, but its role is the subject of ongoing debate. We develop an idealized model for the debris stream evolution combining 3D smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations, the semi-analytic affine model, and 1D finite-volume hydrodynamic simulations. Because our model is computationally cheap, we can unambiguously resolve the nozzle shock, use a realistic equation of state, and follow the debris stream evolution at many different times. Near peak fallback, Hydrogen recombination and molecular Hydrogen formation broaden the stream by a factor $\\sim 5$, enhancing dissipation at the nozzle. However, the dissipation is still insufficient to directly circularize the debris by in-plane pressure gradients. Instead, the thicker stream substantially increases the likelihood that the stream self-intersects on the second orbit, despite relativistic nodal precession. The stream properties at self-intersection are sensitive to dissipation at the nozzle and the timing of focal points where the ballistic trajectories of the debris converge. Our results clarify the nozzle shock's role in circularization in TDEs, providing a foundation for more realistic circularization and emission models.",

For $Pr\\ll1$, it is verified that the instability dependence on thermal diffusion and stratification with the non-dimensional Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency $N$ can be prescribed by a single rescaled parameter $P_{N}=N^{2}Pr$. From direct numerical simulation (DNS), various non-linear features such as axisymmetric Taylor vortices at saturation, secondary instability leading to non-axisymmetric patterns or transition to chaotic states are investigated for various values of $Pr\\leq1$ and the Reynolds number $Re_{i}$. Two-dimensional bi-global LSA on axisymmetric Taylor vortices, which appear as primary centrifugal instability saturates nonlinearly, is also performed to find the secondary critical Reynolds number $Re_{i,2}$ at which the Taylor vortices become unstable by non-axisymmetric perturbation. The bi-global LSA reveals that $Re_{i,2}$ increases (i.e. the onset of secondary instability is delayed) in the range $10^{-3}<1$ at $N=1$ or as $N$ increases at $Pr=0.01$. Secondary instability leading to highly non-axisymmetric or irregular chaotic patterns is further investigated by the 3D DNS. The Nusselt number $Nu$ is also computed from the torque at the inner cylinder for various $Pr$ and $Re_{i}$ at $N=1$ to describe how the angular momentum transfer increases with $Re_{i}$ and how $Nu$ varies differently for saturated and chaotic states.",

However, in realistic scenarios, time-varying arm-lengths introduce additional complexities that require careful modeling. In this work, we investigate the impact of template construction on SGWB parameter estimation under realistic orbital configurations. Using the simulated SGWB signals and dominant instrumental noise sources, we compare three template strategies: time-averaged template constructed from segmented data, equal-arm template, and a template treating the arm-lengths as a free parameter. Our results show that the time-averaged template yield improves parameter estimation accuracy under time-varying arm-lengths, whereas introducing the effective arm-length as a free parameter increases estimation uncertainty.

Unlike the ordinary Peccei-Quinn axion, which is UV-completed into a Goldstone phase of a complex scalar and thereby suffers from the quality problem, the gauge axion is UV-completed directly into a fundamental theory of gravity. We study the domain wall and string structure of the gauge axion and show that the strings sourcing it must be a part of this fundamental theory. We thus observe that the absence of the axion quality problem motivates the presence of fundamental strings. This provides a new argument for a connection between the axion and gravity.",

The model remains analytically tractable while allowing for nonlinear density dependence. We impose thermodynamic and causal consistency conditions and determine the critical densities at which the curvature of the pressure-energy density relation changes. In the non-relativistic limit, the generalized Lane-Emden equations describe a smooth core-crust transition layer. We integrate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations across different $(\\tau_1,\\sigma_1)$ regimes, where these parameters encode thermal and interaction effects in the core. The resulting mass-radius sequences yield low neutron star masses $(0.99-2.05)M_{\\odot}$, and the chemical potential exhibits the characteristic signatures of phase-transition behavior at densities well above the matching point. Our results show that analytic EOS models can reproduce the key phenomenology of phase transitions and provide a controlled framework for exploring low-mass neutron star configurations.",

        "abstract": "The EUV late phase is the second increase of the irradiance of the warm coronal lines during solar flares, and has a crucial impact on the Earth's ionosphere. In this paper, we report on the extremely energetic EUV late phase of a pair of C-class flares (SOL2012-06-17T17:26:11) observed on 2012 June 17 in NOAA active region 11504 by the \\textit{Atmospheric Imaging Assembly} (AIA) instrument on board the \\textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO). The light curves integrated over the flaring region show that a factor of 4.2 more energy is released in the ``warm'' (2$-$3$\\times 10^6$~K) temperature passbands (e.g. AIA 335 \\AA) during the late phase than during the main peaks. The origin of the emission in this extremely energetic EUV late phase is a non-eruptive sigmoid situated in a multi-polar magnetic field configuration, which is rapidly energised by C-class flares. The sigmoid plasma appears to reach temperatures in excess of $10^7$~K, before cooling to produce the EUV late-phase emission. This is seen in high-temperature passbands (e.g. AIA 131 \\AA) and by using differential emission measure analysis. Magnetic extrapolations indicate that the sigmoid is consistent with formation by magnetic reconnection between previously existing J-shaped loops. The sigmoid experienced a fast and a slow cooling stages, both of which were dominated by conductive cooling. The estimated total cooling time of the sigmoid is shorter than the observed value. So, we proposed that the non-eruptive sigmoid, heated by the continuous magnetic reconnection, leads to the extremely energetic EUV late phase.",

In this work, we move beyond the two-parameter Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) form adopted in recent DESI analyses and re-examine neutrino mass constraints using a flexible four-parameter dark energy equation of state (4pDE). We implement the 4pDE model in a modified version of CLASS and perform a full MCMC analysis using Planck, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon+ data. Relative to our previous 4pDE study based on pre-DESI BAO datasets, the inclusion of DESI DR2 substantially tightens the constraints on the transition parameters while still yielding a relaxed neutrino-mass bound compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, $\\sum m_\\nu < 0.101$ eV ($95\\%$ C.L.). This upper limit is more stringent than the DESI DR2 constraint obtained within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework.

        "abstract": "We present a systematic search for signatures of terminal black-hole evaporation in short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) catalogs. An exploding primordial black hole (PBH) undergoing final-stage Hawking radiation is predicted to produce a distinctive \"backwards burst\"-a very short, spectrally hard transient with monotonically increasing flux and little or no longer-wavelength afterglow. We develop a forward-modeling framework that directly compares theoretical PBH evaporation light curves, computed with full Standard Model particle content and detector response folding, against empirical GRB pulse templates. Analyzing 39 well-characterized Swift sGRBs with non-detected or extremely faint afterglows, we find that all events exhibit fast-rise, slow-decay temporal profiles inconsistent with the PBH prediction. Model comparison via Akaike and Bayesian information criteria decisively favors conventional FRED or ERCA fits over the PBH template for every burst. No candidates for terminal PBH evaporation are identified. The null result yields an upper bound on the local PBH explosion rate density $R_{\\mathrm{PBH}} \\lesssim 10^5~\\mathrm{pc}^{-3}~\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, comparable to constraints from dedicated TeV $\\gamma$-ray searches.

        "abstract": "Accurate prediction of the 11-year solar cycle remains a major challenge in solar physics and is important for space weather forecasting. A persistent property of the cycle is its asymmetry: the rise phase is usually much shorter than the decay phase. This asymmetry is often linked to variations in the Sun's meridional circulation, but it is unclear whether these variations are mainly deterministic, produced by Lorentz-force feedback, or stochastic in nature. We investigate this question using kinematic flux-transport dynamo simulations that include three types of time-dependent meridional flow: deterministic variations, stochastic fluctuations, and hybrid combinations of both. We evaluate cycle asymmetry using the ratio of rise to decay times and correlations of cycle amplitude with rise time, rise rate, and decay rate. Our results show that the temporal evolution of the meridional flow strongly controls cycle asymmetry. When both the meridional circulation and the Babcock-Leighton mechanism vary stochastically, the model does not produce cycles in which the decay phase is consistently longer than the rise phase. In contrast, deterministic variations motivated by Lorentz-force feedback and linked to the latitude of maximum toroidal field reproduce the observed asymmetry. In these cases, the meridional flow weakens near cycle maximum, stays reduced for some time, and then recovers, producing a longer decay phase. Hybrid models that mix deterministic and stochastic variability also match the observed rise-decay asymmetry. Across all simulations, cycle amplitude correlates strongly with rise rate, while correlations with rise time and decay rate are weaker but remain significant. These results highlight the key role of meridional flow variability in shaping solar cycle asymmetry and show that incorporating such variability can improve forecasting tools such as Solar Predict.",

Both stars showed evidence of resolved, planet-mass candidate companions in observations using the MIRI mid-infrared imager on JWST. WD2105-82 also showed evidence of an infrared excess consistent with an unresolved 1.4 Jupiter mass companion with an orbital separation of 1\" in the first epoch of JWST observations show measurable proper motion and are thus likely faint, unresolved background galaxies. We also search for common proper motion companions out to hundreds of au, but find no evidence of widely separated companions.",

        "abstract": "Using public data from five pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), we search for a stationary, isotropic, and unpolarized nHz stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). We use pulse time-of-arrival data from 121 pulsars, which is more informative than previous searches, carried out separately by the individual PTA collaborations using only their own data. For pulsars observed by more than one PTA, we employ a new \"direct combination\" method to merge their astrophysical models and data. This avoids the challenge of reconciling the different PTA timing models to obtain a single \"best\" model. A central result of our analysis is posterior probability distributions for the amplitude $A_{gw}$ and exponent $\\gamma_{gw}$ of the putative SGWB energy-density spectrum, modeled as a power law in frequency. While these results are consistent with a nonzero SGWB amplitude $A_{gw}$, the statistical significance--assessed via a Bayesian odds ratio and through noise-marginalized false-alarm probabilities ($p$-values) for three different detection statistics--remains below the conventional $5\\sigma$ threshold for a confident detection. We also reconstruct the inter-pulsar timing-residual correlation as a function of the angle $\\theta$ between the pulsar lines of sight. This is consistent with the curve predicted by Hellings and Downs (HD).",

        "abstract": "Bright points (BPs) are small-scale, dynamic features that are ubiquitous across the solar disc and are often associated with the underlying magnetic field. Using broadband photospheric images obtained with the Visible Broadband Imager at the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), the properties of BPs have been analyzed with DKIST for the first time at the highest spatial resolutions achievable. BPs were observed to have an average lifetime of 95$\\pm$29 s and a mean transverse velocity of 1.60$\\pm$0.41 km/s. The BPs had a log-normal area distribution with a peak at 2300 km$^2$. Transverse velocity and lifetimes across the DKIST images were comparable and consistent with previous studies. The area distribution of the DKIST data peaked in areas significantly lower than those from the literature. This was explored further and was observed to be due to an overestimation of BP areas due to the merging of close features when the spatial resolution is reduced, in tandem with possible over-splitting of features in the DKIST images. Furthermore, the effect of variable seeing within the data was determined. This showed that the average spatial resolution of the data was around 0.''034$\\pm$0.''007 in comparison to the theoretical diffraction-limit of 0.''022. Accounting for the influence of seeing, the peak of the area distribution of BPs in the DKIST data was estimated as 4800 km$^2$, which is still significantly lower than previously observed.",

        "abstract": "We present the first optical ($BVR$) polarimetric observations of Swift J1727.8$-$1613 during its 2023--2024 outburst. Observations were performed during the X-ray hard-to-soft state transition, the soft state and the decaying hard state of the source. For the vast majority of nights, we detect statistically significant polarization of ${\\approx}1$\\%, a fraction of which is of interstellar origin. We find a significant change of polarization coinciding in time with discrete radio ejections. The direction of this polarization variation differs from the directions inferred from the X-ray, sub-mm and radio polarization angles, as well as from the resolved jet orientation. After correcting for the interstellar component, we find that the intrinsic polarization degree remained approximately constant at PD $\\approx 0.3$\\% throughout the hard-intermediate state. We explore several possible origins for the polarization and conclude that it is most plausibly produced by scattering within the optically thin accretion disk wind. The intrinsic polarization angle, PA $\\approx-15\\deg$, is notably offset from the jet axis, which we interpret as evidence for a misalignment between the black hole spin and the orbital axis.",

It enables the detection and tracking of solar active regions that have rotated to the farside (invisible surface) of the Sun without relying on direct observational platforms such as satellites. By applying the technique of helioseismic holography to continuous Doppler images of the front side (visible surface), the pipeline infers the size and location of these regions through the acoustic signatures. These farside maps, produced using data from the NSO's GONG Network, allow scientists and solar observers to monitor the behavior of solar active regions. They support efforts to protect vital telecommunications and national interest infrastructure. While the data from this pipeline are widely used to many scientific, industrial, and national security applications, global helioseismic monitoring remains a developing field, with ongoing refinements in methodology and reliability. In this report, we will outline the updates made to the NSO's Farside Pipeline which have resulted in more accurate and consistent helioseismic maps, strengthening its value for both operational forecasting and scientific research.",

        "title": "SATMO: a Multi-Planet Thermal Analysis Tool for CubeSat Missions",
        "abstract": "The expansion of commercial launch capabilities has significantly increased opportunities for interplanetary small satellite (SmallSat) missions. As researchers plan for more missions beyond Earth, there is a demand for accessible tools that help better predict and understand the thermal effects on their spacecraft in orbital environments around Earth and other bodies. While commercial thermal analysis tools offer high-fidelity modeling capabilities and results, they are often expensive and require extensive training to be used effectively. This paper details a framework for a user-friendly Satellite Thermal Model (SATMO) to support the early stages of space mission planning for CubeSats orbiting Earth and other Solar System bodies. SATMO is an open-source, MATLAB-based, six-node thermal analysis program designed for satellites in low-altitude circular orbits. Although SATMO requires a MATLAB license -- typically inexpensive or institutionally provided in academic settings -- it remains substantially more accessible than professional thermal analysis software. SATMO requires an internet connection for some features but does not rely on additional MATLAB toolboxes. The SATMO modeling approach is validated with the space industry standard Thermal Desktop software, with temperatures comparable to within 1.17$^\\circ$C for a 10 cm $\\times$ 10 cm $\\times$ 10 cm CubeSat in various configurations, orbiting around primary bodies including Earth, Venus, and Mars. An example use case of SATMO is presented with a Mars-orbiting CubeSat to demonstrate its functionalities and the outputs available to users. SATMO offers increased accessibility to satellite thermal modeling for the research community, enabling quick thermal trade studies and interplanetary mission plans.",

        "abstract": "Mrk~421 is one of the most fascinating blazars, widely studied across the electromagnetic spectrum using observations at various wavebands, from radio to the TeV gamma ray bands. We present the first detailed spectral and timing analysis of the TeV blazar Mrk~421 based on 45 X-ray observations from the \\textit{NICER} X-ray telescope, collected over two years from 2022 to 2024. The source exhibits strong X-ray variability across intraday and long-term timescales. During this period, we observe a dramatic change in flux, from $\\sim 50$ to $\\sim 1380$~counts~s$^{-1}$, representing a $\\sim 28$-fold increase. Spectral modeling with power-law, broken power-law, and log-parabolic functions shows that the log-parabola provides the most accurate description of the X-ray spectra. The hardness ratio analysis confirms a \\textit{harder-when-brighter} trend, consistent with the anticorrelation between flux and both $\\Gamma$ and $\\alpha$. Correlation studies reveal a positive relation between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, a negative correlation between $\\beta$ and synchrotron peak energy $E_{\\mathrm{p}}$, and a positive correlation between $E_{\\mathrm{p}}$ and flux. These observed features can be interpreted within the framework of energy-dependent particle acceleration in blazar jets, which are often associated with turbulence, strong magnetic fields, and relativistic outflows. This work demonstrates that observations from \\textit{NICER} can play an important role in blazar variability studies and motivate future multiwavelength campaigns aimed at fully characterizing the dynamical processes in relativistic jets.",

        "abstract": "Dwarf galaxies dominate the galaxy population in the nearby Universe and occupy the regime where feedback, reionization, and environment exert their strongest influence on galaxy formation. Despite their importance, detailed spectroscopic constraints on the faintest dwarfs are currently limited to a handful of systems in the Local Volume, leaving the role of large-scale environment essentially unexplored at ultra-low stellar masses. A northern 30-40m class telescope equipped with a multiplexed optical integral-field spectrograph will enable a systematic, spatially resolved spectroscopic census of dwarf galaxies with $M_\\star \\sim 10^{5}-10^{7} M_\\odot$ across a wide range of environments. A deep survey of the Coma Cluster, combined with targeted observations of dwarfs in clusters, groups, filaments, and low-density regions, will map star formation histories, chemical enrichment, and internal kinematics at unprecedented depth. This program will directly test models of dark-matter physics, early-Universe feedback, and environmental quenching in the lowest-mass galaxies, establishing dwarf galaxies as precision probes of both galaxy formation and fundamental physics.",

        "abstract": "By the 2040s--50s, facilities such as \\emph{Gaia}, WEAVE, 4MOST, Rubin, \\emph{Euclid}, \\emph{Roman}, and the ESO ELT will have transformed our global view of the Milky Way. Yet key questions will remain incompletely resolved: a detailed reconstruction of the Galaxy's assembly from its earliest building blocks, and robust tests of dark matter granularity using the fine structure of the stellar halo and outer disk -- particularly in the Galactic anticenter. Addressing these questions requires high-resolution spectroscopy of faint main-sequence stars (typically 1--2 mag below the turnoff) and turnoff stars ($r \\sim 21$--23) in low-surface-brightness structures: halo streams and shells, ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, the warped and flared outer disk, and anticenter substructures. We argue that addressing this science case requires a 30\\,m-class telescope in the northern hemisphere, equipped with wide-field, highly multiplexed, high-resolution spectroscopic capabilities. Such a facility would enable (i) a Northern Halo Deep Survey of $\\sim 10^{5}$--$10^{6}$ faint main-sequence and turnoff stars out to $\\sim 150$--200\\,kpc, (ii) chemodynamical mapping of dozens of streams to measure perturbations from dark matter subhalos, and (iii) tomographic studies of the anticenter and outer disk to disentangle perturbed disk material from accreted debris. A northern 30\\,m telescope would provide the essential complement to ESO's southern ELT, enabling genuinely all-sky Milky Way archaeology and delivering stringent constraints on the small-scale structure of dark matter.",

        "abstract": "We develop a novel technique to probe the $S_8$ tension, using information from the smallest scales of galaxy redshift survey data. Specifically, we use Basilisk, a Bayesian hierarchical tool for forward modeling the kinematics and abundance of satellite galaxies extracted from spectroscopic data, to first constrain the galaxy-halo connection precisely and accurately. We then demand self-consistency in that the galaxy-halo connection predicts the correct galaxy luminosity function, which constrains the halo mass function and thereby cosmology. Crucially, the method accounts for baryonic effects and is free of halo assembly bias issues. We validate the method against realistic SDSS-like mock data, demonstrating unbiased recovery of the input cosmology. Applying it to the SDSS-DR7, we infer that $\\Omega_{\\rm m} = 0.324 \\pm 0.012$, $\\sigma_8 = 0.775 \\pm 0.063$ and $S_8 \\equiv \\sigma_8 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3} = 0.81 \\pm 0.05$, in perfect agreement with the cosmic microwave background constraints from Planck. The most stringent constraint is with regard to the parameter combination $\\sigma_8 (\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3)^2$, which we infer to be $0.91 \\pm 0.05$. Hence, unlike many low-redshift analyses of large-scale structure data, we find no indication of $S_8$ tension. We demonstrate that these results are robust to reasonable variation in the implementation of baryonification used to model the host halo's gravitational potentials in response to baryonic processes. We also highlight the importance of correctly modeling the satellite radial profile in any analysis involving small-scale information. Finally, we underscore the hidden potential of this methodology for constraining baryonic physics using data from ongoing and upcoming surveys.",

Currently available telescopes cannot adequately detect and measure heavy element recombination lines and certain faint collisionally excited lines, which are essential for exploring the effects and biases that potential inhomogeneities in electron temperature and density of the ionized gas may have on determining the chemical composition of these galaxies. On the other hand, the origin of very high-ionization lines (e.g. He II, [Ne V], C IV]) measured in the spectra of an important fraction of these objects remains unknown and a challenge to current stellar models, suggesting the presence of Population III-like stars and/or the existence of non-conventional ionizing sources. Obtaining very deep spectra for a selected sample of local star-forming dwarf galaxies would provide unprecedented constraints on their nature, ionization and true chemical abundances, and could change the metallicity scale we assume to understand the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic time.",

        "abstract": "I report the discovery of three faint, semi-resolved quiescent dwarf galaxies, two of which are strong backsplash candidates associated with the nearby satellite-sparse spiral M101 (D ~ 6.7 Mpc). The galaxies lie within the magnitude range MV ~ -7.70 to -8.2 and half-light radii rh ~ 110 to 204 pc. Shapiro DG-I (Sha DG-I/MAGE1412+5650) is a concurrently discovered and isolated galaxy. Shapiro DG-II (Sha DG-II) is a fainter dwarf and potential companion to the SMC-mass galaxy NGC 5585 (D ~ 6.84 Mpc). Shapiro DG-III (Sha DG-III) is an isolated dwarf on the edge of the ultra-faint regime. Hydrodynamical simulations suggest a backsplash population of galaxies that have been environmentally stripped by interactions with a host and ejected from the system, though they have not yet been definitively observed in the local universe. Considering their quenched stellar populations, indicated by the lack of coincident GALEX emission, relative distances, and fitting models, the galaxies are consistent with a backsplash origin and are pending follow-up. Analysis is performed to test whether the system's population can be explained by standard cosmology. A potential correlation is found between satellite abundances and halo masses calibrated by tidal indices in a sample of nearby MW-like galaxies, suggesting the importance of environmental density in the formation of dark matter subhaloes, though a larger sample is required. M101's sparse satellite system fits well in the relation and is in agreement with {\\Lambda}CDM expectations.",

        "abstract": "The dust content of star-forming galaxies is generally positively correlated with their stellar mass. However, some recent JWST studies have shown the existence of a population of dwarf galaxies with an unexpectedly large dust attenuation. Using the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) data, we identified a sample of 1361 highly extincted low-mass (HELM) galaxies, defined as dwarf galaxies ($M_*1mag or more massive galaxies with an exceptionally high dust attenuation given their stellar mass (i.e., $Av>1.6log_{10}(M_*/Mo)-12.6$). The selection is performed using the multiparameter distribution obtained through a comprehensive spectral energy distribution fitting analysis, based on optical to near-infrared data. After excluding possible contaminants, like brown dwarfs, little red dots, high-z (z>8.5) and ultra-high-z (z>15) galaxies, the sample mainly includes sources at z<1, with a tail extending up to z=7.2. The sample has a median stellar mass of $10^7$ Mo and a median dust attenuation of Av=2mag. We analysed the morphology, environment and star-formation rate of these sources to investigate the reason of their large dust attenuation. In particular, HELM sources have sizes (effective radii, Re) similar to non-dusty dwarf galaxies and no correlation is visible between the axis ratios (b/a) and the dust attenuation. This findings indicate that it is unlikely that the large dust attenuation is due to projection effects, but a prolate or a disk-on oblate geometry are still possible, at least for a subsample of the sources. We have found that the distribution of HELM sources is slightly skewed toward more clustered environments than non-dusty dwarfs and tend to be slightly less star forming. This finding, if confirmed by spectroscopic follow-up, indicates that HELM sources could be going through some environmental processes, such as galaxy interactions.",

        "abstract": "Context. In order to determine stellar luminosities and radii, it is necessary to know the total bolometric fluxes emitted by the stars, or equivalently the bolometric corrections (BCs) as accurately as possible.   Aims. The aim of this paper is to present and describe a new database of synthetic stellar magnitudes and bolometric corrections for 752 filters from 78 ground- and space-based instruments calculated using the most recent version of the BOSZ synthetic stellar spectral library.   Methods. From the entire grid of the BOSZ theoretical spectra, our synthetic magnitudes in the Vega magnitude system were determined using the corresponding routines of the Python package species.   Results. The database spans effective temperatures from 2800 to 16000~K, log g from $-0.5$ to 5.5, metallicities from $-2.5$ to 0.75, [$\\alpha$/M] from $-0.25$ to 0.5, [C/M] from $-0.75$ to 0.5, and reddening up to $A_V$ = 3.1 mag. Using high-resolution (R = 50000) synthetic spectra allowed us to precisely track the effect of abundances on the bolometric corrections and luminosity of stars.   Conclusions. By applying the new bolometric corrections (BCs) to 192\\,000 APOGEE stars we calculated luminosities, and also demonstrated that neglecting carbon can introduce up to $\\pm$0.2\\% errors in luminosity. The new Gothard Observatory Synthetic Stellar Photometry Database may enable more accurate fundamental parameter determinations for large stellar samples using a vast amount of past, present, and upcoming surveys, such as Gaia, LSST, and the Roman Space Telescope.",

Across all stellar mass bins, ALFALFA galaxies exhibit lower median dark matter masses than the mock TNG100 simulation results. In each bin, this offset is driven by a tail of galaxies with comparatively low dark matter content, which becomes more prominent toward higher stellar masses. In the highest mass bin ($M_* > 10^{11} M_\\odot$), late-type ALFALFA galaxies show a median dark matter mass that is 23% lower than that of their counterparts in the TNG100 dark-matter-only simulation, with 32% of ALFALFA galaxies having $M_\\mathrm{DM}(<10^{11.5} M_\\odot$, compared to 17% in the mock TNG100 sample.

For stars in particular, surface magnetism polarization that can be detected and measured with spectro-polarimetry. Many questions about these surface fields remain unanswered due to a lack of dedicated instruments capable of probing weak and strong surface magnetic fields for the entire mass range of stars, from M-dwarfs (and even substellar objects) to massive O-type stars at different evolutionary stages and metallicities. These questions range from the origin of these fields to their true incidence rate throughout the stellar population and the dependence on metallicity. Magnetic fields, although currently often excluded from stellar evolution models, play an important role in stellar evolution. Connecting the surface fields to internal fields through asteroseismology will instigate a new era of understanding stellar evolution and the transport of angular momentum and chemical elements throughout stellar interiors, also impacting our understanding of star-planet interactions and stellar remnants. Polarimetry is also an under-utilized tool to observationally constrain the mode identification of nonradial oscillations, which lies at the basis of accurate asteroseismic parameter estimation at percentage-level for stellar radii, masses, ages, internal rotation, and magnetic field strengths. Combining strong constraints on mode identification and surface magnetic properties through the acquisition of time-resolved, high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise (S/N) spectro-polarimetry and spectroscopy promises to bring leaps forward in our understanding of stellar structure, particularly when combined with long-term space photometric data from past, current, and future missions.",

We determine what can drive an $\\alpha$-bimodality of the disc in a zoom-in hydrodynamical simulated galaxy which has had no major mergers and negligible radial migration. Using a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the FIRE-2 suite of simulations, we analyse gas flows in the disc together with its star formation and merger history, as well as the chemical evolution of the hot corona, to investigate their connection to transitions in the chemo-dynamical structure of the stellar disc and its radial distribution. The simulated galaxy exhibits high and low-$\\alpha$ sequences without having experienced major mergers nor significant radial migration. A high-$\\alpha$ thick disc forms during the early chaotic clustering phase. Afterwards, as the star formation rate declines, a dip in the stellar number density appears, coinciding with the dilution of the galactic corona by a minor merger, which subsequently halts the rise of [Fe/H] in the disc. Later, accreted gas onto the disc from minor mergers, mildly enhances the star formation rate and generates the low-$\\alpha$ sequence in the outer disc, with radial inward flows of this material feeding the low-$\\alpha$ inner disc. Furthermore, we find that even at fixed radii, newly formed stars retain a sizable spread in their chemical abundances, reflecting chemical differences between the in-situ and the infalling gas from which they formed, further indicating that instantaneous gas mixing is invalid. Understanding the chemical evolution of stellar discs requires accounting for their accretion merger history and interaction with the surrounding hot corona, as well as the vertical and radial gas flows that redistribute metals within the disc.",

We investigate a complex of three galaxies UGC 6697, CGCG 097-073 and CGCG 097-079, that are currently undergoing extreme RPS, as evident from their multi-wavelength-detected tails. The galaxies are members of the nearby ($d=92$ Mpc) merging cluster Abell 1367 and are located in proximity to an intracluster medium (ICM) shock that is traced by X-ray observations and the presence of a radio relic. We analyze LOFAR and MeerKAT observations at frequencies of 54, 144, 817 and 1270 MHz to perform a detailed spectral analysis of the tails. We find that all three tails are significantly more extended than in previous radio studies, with lengths $\\geq70$ kpc. For UGC 6697, we detected a tail of 300 kpc, making it the longest known RPS tail of a star-forming galaxy at any wavelength. The length and spectral variations of the tail cannot be explained purely by the spectral aging of stripped cosmic rays. We construct a model of the tail that includes compression and re-acceleration due to the encounter with the nearby ICM shock, which can plausibly account for the extreme RPS as well as the length and spectral variation of the tail. We further discover a radio plume at the leading edge of UGC 6697 that connects to a narrow filament. These sources exhibit extremely steep ($\\alpha\\approx-1.7$) and highly curved spectra. We speculate that this emission arises from cosmic rays re-energized by UGC 6697's rapid infall which propagate along magnetic filaments in the cluster center. Our findings represent direct evidence of a cluster merger shock impacting the evolution of member galaxies. Furthermore, we report the first tentative detection of particle acceleration at the leading edge of an infalling galaxy.",

        "abstract": "Mass-loss from massive stars is fundamental to stellar and galactic evolution and enrichment of the interstellar medium. Reliable determination of mass-loss rate is dependent upon unravelling details of massive star outflows, including optical depth structure of the stellar wind. That parameter introduces significant uncertainty due to the nearly ubiquitous presence of large-scale optically thick wind structure. We utilize suitable available ultraviolet spectra of 20 Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC, SMC) OB stars to extend existing Galactic results quantifying uncertainty inherent in individual observations to lower metallicity environments. This is achieved by measuring standard deviations of mean optical depths of multiple observations of suitable wind-formed absorption profiles as a proportion of their mean optical depths. We confirm earlier findings that wind structure is prevalent at low metallicities and demonstrate that quantifying the consequent uncertainty is to some extent possible, despite the near-complete absence of time series UV spectroscopic observations in those environments. We find that the uncertainty inherent in any single observation of stellar wind optical depth at low metallicity is of similar magnitude to that already identified at Galactic metallicity (up to 45% for cooler OB stars). We further demonstrate how the effect of varying narrow absorption components in wind-formed UV spectral profiles is unlikely to be properly accounted for in existing mass-loss models. We present further evidence of a binary companion to the SMC O-type giant star AzV 75. The importance of obtaining high cadence multi-epoch, or genuine time series, UV spectroscopic observations at low metallicities is highlighted.",

        "abstract": "The ESA Gaia mission has revolutionized our understanding of the white dwarf population, delivering an unprecedented census of these nearby remnants and revealing previously unseen structures in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. However, while Gaia has expanded the scope of white dwarf astrophysics, it has also exposed new questions related to atmospheric composition, spectral evolution, crystallization, magnetism, and merger-driven pathways. Many of these open problems are encoded in the detailed morphology of the Gaia HR diagram, where precise spectroscopic characterization is essential for interpreting the underlying physical processes. Spectroscopic characterization, obtainable with current and future ESO facilities, can provide the effective temperatures and surface gravities that are required to derive accurate white dwarf masses, cooling ages, and luminosities. These fundamental parameters not only enable studies of spectral evolution, interior physics, and the origin of magnetic and high-mass white dwarfs, but also guarantee the construction of robust mass distributions and luminosity functions, essential for constraining the initial-to-final mass relation, probing the initial mass function, and reconstructing the star formation history of the local Galaxy, among other applications. Looking toward the 2040s, future multi-fiber spectrographs operating in survey mode on 10--15 meter class telescopes will be able to collect a complete spectroscopic sample of white dwarf, enabling the detailed characterization of their population. Achieving spectroscopic completeness for the nearby Galactic population and securing high signal-to-noise, moderate-to-high resolution spectra across the HR diagram with ESO instrumentation will be critical steps toward resolving these longstanding questions in white dwarf astrophysics.",

        "abstract": "High-redshift ($z > 3$), massive quiescent galaxies (QGs) offer a significant window into early Universe galaxy formation. Previous works have predicted miscellaneous properties for these quiescents, from an overdensity of neighbors to elevated quenched fractions among such neighbors (i.e. galactic conformity). However, due to a scarcity in highly-resolved deep-field observations until recently, these properties have not been closely examined and pose unresolved questions for galaxy evolution. With new photometric-redshift catalogs from JWST data in the COSMOS-Web field, we present the S$\\mathrm{\\hat{O}}$NG sample, comprising 171 photometrically selected massive ($\\geq10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$) QGs with $3\\leq$ $z\\mathrm{_{phot}}$ $<$ 5. We look for low-mass neighbors around our sample and find substantial populations of star-forming galaxies (SFGs), contrasting the conformity effect at low-$z$. Our QGs also exhibit diverse clustering, from having no neighbors to potentially residing in environments no denser than star-forming equivalents, to being accompanied by SFGs with more stellar mass than the QG itself. Using a geometric method, we also report filamentary signals for 4\\% of our sample, suggestive of some QGs' rejuvenation via cold gas accretion. We reapply the analysis on seven spectroscopically confirmed QGs in COSMOS-Web (M$_*$ $\\sim$ $10^9-10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$) and note similar patterns. Lastly, we report on Saigon, the most distant low-mass quiescent galaxy known to date ($z =$ 4.55, M$_*$ $= 1.33 \\times10^9$ M$_\\odot$); this spectroscopically confirmed QG resides in a protocluster candidate with 11 SFGs. These results pave new paths towards understanding QG environment, while also signaling an opportune era to examine their evolution with JWST.",

        "title": "White Dwarfs in Wide Binary Systems as Reliable Age Calibrators",
        "abstract": "Deriving precise stellar ages is a challenging task. Consequently, age-dependent relations - such as the age-metallicity and age-velocity dispersion relations of the Milky Way, or the age-rotation-activity relation of low-mass stars - are subject to potentially large uncertainties, despite the well-defined trends observed at the population level. White dwarfs, the most common stellar remnants, follow a relatively simple and well-understood cooling process. When found in wide binary systems with main-sequence companions, they can therefore provide the much-needed precise age estimates. The total age of such systems depends not only on the white dwarf cooling time but also on the lifetime of the main-sequence progenitor. Estimating this lifetime requires knowledge of the progenitor mass, which is typically inferred by adopting an initial-to-final mass relation. However, the observational constraints on this relation are still poorly defined, introducing a source of uncertainty in white dwarf age determinations. To mitigate this issue, we focus on a large sample of massive white dwarfs (>~0.7 Msun), for which the main-sequence progenitor lifetime is negligible. These white dwarfs are intrinsically faint and therefore require specialized facilities for adequate follow-up observations. In this white paper, we outline the instrumentation requirements needed to observe the forthcoming population of massive white dwarfs in our Galaxy.",

        "abstract": "Space-based photometry has substantially increased the number of pulsating stars found in binary systems by more than four orders of magnitude. Combined with high-resolution spectroscopy, high-precision photometry offers model-independent constraints on stellar parameters and internal processes. The advent of space-based photometric surveys has given us access to populations of tidally perturbed pulsators, which offer a unique and demanding set of constraints on tidal physics and stellar interiors. However, we lack the ability to undertake multi-epoch, high-resolution spectroscopy at large scale. The ability to obtain phase-resolved, high-resolution spectra would allow us to place precise, model-independent constraints on the stellar properties of pulsators in binary systems that will truly test our close binary asteroseismic modelling techniques, leading to much-needed constraints on fundamental stellar and binary physics. The need to properly cover the large parameter-space of binary stars demands a large-scale, population-level analysis in order to understand the complex landscape of binary stellar evolution. To enable this population-level analysis, we need a dedicated multi-fibre spectrograph (30--200 fibres) with high spectral resolution ($R\\geq 50000$), high signal-to-noise ratio ($\\mathrm{S/N\\geq 300}$), and a limiting magnitude of approximately 15.

        "abstract": "This white paper highlights how stellar population gradients, chemical abundance patterns, stellar initial mass function (IMF) variations, and structural signatures in early-type galaxies (ETGs), measured at faint and large galactocentric radii, out to $\\sim4R_e$, provide powerful diagnostics of their formation and evolutionary histories. These observables encode the combined effects of early dissipative star formation, subsequent accretion and mergers, and internal feedback processes. Achieving such measurements requires high-signal-to-noise, spatially resolved U-band--optical--near-IR spectroscopy at large radii, with enough spatial resolution to study the variation of these properties on $\\sim$kpc scales. These capabilities can only be delivered by a 30\\,m-class telescope. Disentangling these internal processes from environmental influences further demands observations of galaxies across clusters spanning a wide range of evolutionary stages and local environments. The nearby Virgo, Perseus, and Coma clusters, without any comparable nearby counterparts in the Southern Hemisphere, offer ideal laboratories for this work. Such observations will place stringent constraints on the formation mechanism of ETGs, connecting local cluster ETGs to their high-redshift progenitors. This white paper outlines several key science cases enabled by such a facility: (1) mapping stellar population gradients across environments; (2) tracing IMF variations as a function of evolutionary stage and environment; (3) reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of galaxies through deep integral-field spectroscopy and imaging; and (4) identifying and studying compact and relic systems as progenitors of present-day ETGs.",

        "abstract": "Collisional ring galaxies are a rare class of interacting systems, making up only ~0.01% of galaxies in the local Universe. Their formation is typically attributed to a head-on collision of a massive galaxy with a compact satellite (intruder), triggering density waves that, propagating outward, produce the characteristic ring morphology. Here, we present the discovery and detailed analysis of GS18660, the most distant ring galaxy known to date, at z=3.08, identified in JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations as part of the GA-NIFS programme. This work aims to characterise the physical and dynamical properties of GS18660 and shed light into the formation of its ring. Specifically, we analyse the ionized gas properties, stellar populations, and gas kinematics of the system, and use the observed geometry to constrain the timescale of the collision. Our analysis is based on NIRSpec IFS data, including low-resolution (R~100) spectroscopy covering ~0.2-1.3um rest-frame, and high-resolution (R~2700) spectroscopy covering 0.4-0.8um rest-frame. Multi-wavelength techniques are applied to derive nebular gas conditions and stellar population properties. Gas kinematic analysis reveals that GS18660 exhibits a rotating disk component with an additional radial expansion velocity of ~200 km/s, consistent with a propagating collisional wave. Nebular line diagnostics indicate intense star formation (SFR ~100 Msun/yr) along the ring and in the nucleus. Stellar population analysis shows that the most recent star formation episode, occurring within the last ~50 Myr, predominantly took place in the ring. We also identify a close companion, the intruder galaxy responsible for the collision, moving away with a relative velocity of ~425 km/s. The evidence strongly favours a collisional origin for the ring in GS18660, though the presence of a recently formed bar (and hence a resonance ring) cannot be completely excluded.",

We show that population statistics on void galaxy properties can be recovered from watershed-based void catalogs. Differences between galaxy populations are most pronounced interior to the shell-crossing surface (i.e., population [3]) where densities are intermediate to high. Compared to non-void galaxies at all redshifts, the density controlled galaxies are bluer, smaller, more actively star forming, more massive, and less metal enriched. At redshifts $\\geq 1$, these differences are less apparent, likely caused by resolution and selection effects incurred by attempting to define a density-controlled sample from a watershed-based void finding algorithm. Further, we investigate the fraction of galaxies with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and find that our density controlled population has AGN fractions that are significantly higher than those of non-void galaxy population ($79.8 \\pm 0.4$\\% higher at $z=0.0$ and $61.5\\pm 0.7$\\% higher at larger redshifts).",

(2) A pre-trained dual-encoder convolutional neural network based on ConvNeXt and ViT is used to encode the image data, while contrastive learning is then applied to reduce the dimension of the features. (3) We adopt a Bagging-based clustering model to cluster galaxies with similar features into distinct groups. By carefully dividing the redshift bins, we apply this model to the rest-frame optical images of galaxies in the COSMOS-Web field within the redshift range of $0.5 < z < 6.0$. Compared to the previous algorithm, the improved UML method successfully classifies 73\\% galaxies. Using the GoogleNet algorithm, we classify the morphology of the remaining 27\\% galaxies. To validate the reliability of our updated algorithm, we compared our classification results with other galaxy morphological parameters and found a good consistency with galaxy evolution. Benefiting from its higher efficiency, this updated algorithm is well-suited for application in future China Space Station Telescope missions.",

        "abstract": "The detection and characterization of protoplanets in protoplanetary disks around young stars is emerging as a transformative field that will redefine our understanding of how planetary systems form. While current facilities have revealed the diversity of mature exoplanets and the complex structures of disks, we still lack the crucial observational link between them: a statistically meaningful census of planets caught in the act of formation. This white paper argues that such a breakthrough requires access to the nearest and most informative star-forming regions, roughly half of which are poorly accessible or entirely unreachable from Cerro Armazones. Although the ELT alone will strongly impact our knowledge of planet formation, its location prevents Europe from fully exploiting the necessary parameter space. A 30-40 m telescope in the northern hemisphere is therefore essential for obtaining diffraction-limited imaging of protoplanets and disks across the entire sky, enabling robust demographics, exploiting synergies with ngVLA, Gaia, and other facilities covering the north, and ensuring that Europe remains at the forefront of the planet-formation revolution in the coming decades.",

This white paper outlines key science opportunities arising in the next decade and the technological requirements of future ESO facilities in enabling transformative discoveries in the 2040s.

We make use of the extended, and in many cases overlapping, light curves from multiple microlensing surveys, to study RR Lyrae stars with apparent mean-magnitude variations. A modified Fourier-series based fitting method is introduced to analyze the light curves showing mean-magnitude variations. Data from infrared surveys are also used to construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Results. 72 stars are presented where the mean-magnitude variations are most probably of genuine astrophysical origin, and not the result of problems with the photometry. The ratio of variation between the V and I bands is compatible with variable extinction by dust in most cases, but no infrared excess is detected in the SEDs. The occurrence rate of the phenomenon, after correcting for selection effects, is $\\sim0.9\\%$ among RR Lyrae variables in the OGLE bulge fields.",

        "abstract": "By the 2040s, several all-sky surveys will have transformed our view of the large-scale structure. However, one of the major outstanding questions in astrophysics will remain: understanding how galaxies acquire and evolve their angular momentum and how this connects to the cosmic web. Measuring the alignments between galaxy spins and cosmic filaments across cosmic time, and understanding what this reveals about galaxy evolution, requires surveys that also characterise intrinsic alignments, i.e. correlations in galaxy shapes produced by the cosmic web itself rather than by lensing. Intrinsic alignments are a major source of systematic error in weak-lensing measurements of the fundamental parameters of the Universe. Addressing both questions together will necessitate new types of MOS surveys that combine kinematic information with high-completeness redshifts down to at least 24-25mag. To achieve our science goals, we require a new generation of wide-field spectroscopic facilities that can obtain spin-filament alignment measurements for millions of galaxies while simultaneously delivering sub-Mpc resolution of the cosmic web and spatially-resolved kinematics required to map the spin-filament connection at the level of individual galaxies within their local cosmic environment. Such a program would provide a unique legacy survey of galaxies and cosmic structures from kiloparsec to megaparsec scales, establishing ESO's leadership in bridging the physics of galaxy evolution with the systematic-control requirements for Stage-IV cosmological surveys.",

The training data are generated by full numerical calculations using two public BBN codes, PArthENoPE and AlterBBN, modified to accommodate extended cosmologies that include dark radiation and a stiff equation of state. The network employs a residual multi-head architecture to capture convoluted physical relationships. BBNet produces primordial helium-4 and deuterium abundances with negligible errors in milliseconds per sample, achieving a speed-up of up to $10^4$ times relative to first-principles solvers while remaining unbiased over wide parameter ranges. Therefore, our emulator can supersede traditional simplified numerical prescriptions that compromise accuracy for speed. Based on extensive assessments of its performance, we conclude that BBNet is an optimal solution to the theoretical prediction of primordial element abundances.

Such surveys would deliver transformative advances: (i) cosmological constraints on absolute neutrino masses ($\\Sigma m_\\nu \\lesssim 0.015\\,\\mathrm{eV}$), three times more stringent than Stage IV, enabling resolution of the neutrino mass hierarchy; (ii) detection of primordial non-Gaussianity at the level of $f_{\\mathrm{NL}} \\sim 1$, probing multi-field inflation; (iii) measurements of structure growth $f\\sigma_8(z)$ spanning cosmic time to constrain dark energy and test gravitational modifications.

        "abstract": "We revisit the local distance ladder measurement of the Hubble constant in models where gravity is modified by a fifth force, an additional long-range interaction. In many such theories the force is screened; suppressed in dense environments but potentially active in galaxies used for distance calibration. We model this environmental dependence using three quantities that characterize each galaxy's large-scale gravitational environment: the external gravitational potential $\\Phi$, acceleration $a$, and curvature $K$. Our baseline analysis recalibrates the SH0ES-team's Cepheid-supernova distance ladder, incorporating the fifth force via its impact on the Cepheid period-luminosity relation. Across models, a fifth force is strongly constrained, with posteriors concentrated around a null result. The inferred Hubble constant is $H_0 = 73.1 \\pm 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, retaining the Hubble tension at $>5 \\, \\sigma$. As an additional test, we incorporate four independent Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance datasets into a joint Cepheid-TRGB-supernova calibration. These combined analyses further constrain the magnitude of fifth-force effects. Taken together, our results show that, across the class of screened fifth-force models we analyze, the calibration of the local distance ladder remains essentially unchanged, leaving the Hubble tension intact.",

We begin by reviewing basic aspects of lattice field theory, including symplectic and non-symplectic evolution algorithms. We then introduce lattice implementations of non-canonical interactions, considering scalars with a non-minimal coupling to gravity, $\\phi^2R$, non-minimal scalar kinetic theories, $\\mathcal{G}_{ab}(\\lbrace\\phi_c\\rbrace)\\partial_\\mu\\phi^a\\partial^\\mu\\phi^b$, and axion-like particle (ALP) interactions with Abelian gauge fields, $\\phi F_{\\mu\\nu}\\tilde F^{\\mu\\nu}$. Next, we discuss methods to set up special field configurations, including the creation of cosmic defect networks towards scaling (e.g. cosmic strings and domain walls), field configurations based on arbitrary power spectra or spatial profiles, and probabilistic methods as required e.g. for thermal configurations. We further extend the notion of non-canonical theories, discussing the discretization of scalar field dynamics in $d + 1$ dimensions, with $d \\neq 3$. Unrelated to non-canonical aspects, we also discuss implementation(s) of gravitational wave (GW) dynamics on the lattice.

In 2040s, the urgency of resolving long-standing questions regarding the physics behind the dynamical interaction stages and the absolute and relative frequencies of binary evolutionary pathways will only increase owing to rapidly expanding population statistics of gravitational wave events. Here, we argue that multi-wavelength observations (spectroscopy and photometry), linear spectropolarimetry, and interferometry of a large number of Luminous Red Novae, a particular class of transients associated with dynamical binary interactions, will provide unprecedented details about the underlying interaction physics. A breakthrough will be achieved by a tenfold or larger increase in identifications of transient-type events from interacting binaries and their follow-up with instrumentation that provides at least 10 times better angular resolution, 100 times better spectral resolution, and $\\sim$100 times higher sensitivity than 2030s facilities.",

        "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of stellar space weather and can strongly influence the habitability of exoplanets. However, compared to the frequent occurrence of white-light flares, confirmed stellar CMEs remain extremely rare. Whether such flares are commonly accompanied by CMEs is a key question for solar-stellar comparative studies. Using Sun-as-a-star soft X-ray flare light curves observed by the GOES XRS 1--8~\\AA\\ channel, we compiled a sample of 1,766 M-class and larger solar flares and extracted features with both deep convolutional neural networks and manual methods. Five machine-learning classifiers were trained to distinguish eruptive from confined flares, with the random forest model achieving the best performance (true skill statistic; TSS = 0.31). This TSS value indicates that the model possesses a moderate ability to discriminate between eruptive and confined flares. Normalized white-light and GOES XRS flare light curves show broadly consistent temporal evolution, reflecting their shared energy-release history and supporting a probabilistic transfer of the model to white-light flare data. We applied the best-performing RF model to 41,405 TESS-detected flares on FGKM-type main-sequence stars, predicting that approximately 47% of events show CME-like morphological characteristics, with the model-implied intrinsic association fraction lying in the range 35%--60%. Intriguingly, the CME occurrence rate decreases with increasing flare energy, indicating that the most energetic flares may be more strongly confined by overlying magnetic fields. These results provide new insight into flare-CME connections in diverse stellar environments and have important implications for assessing the impact of stellar eruptive activity on exoplanetary atmospheres.",

        "abstract": "The recent discovery of a large population of overmassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe challenges the validity of the BH-host galaxy coevolution framework. However, the reliability of the estimated BH masses (M$_{BH}$) is being questioned, as these are typically derived using single-epoch (SE) relations calibrated locally. Calibrating SE relations at high redshift would therefore enable more accurate M$_{BH}$ estimates and help identify potential biases. In this work, we release a data-reduction technique for JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations that doubles the effective wavelength coverage, enabling detection of otherwise inaccessible emission. Whenever adjacent dispersers are required, observers should carefully evaluate the tradeoff between integrating longer in the bluer configuration alone versus distributing the exposure time across two dispersers. We apply this pipeline to a sample of 5 quasars at z~2 with M$_{BH}$ independently measured through reverberation mapping (RM). This enables a joint analysis of both H$\\beta$ and H$\\alpha$; the latter lying beyond the nominal wavelength range. We assess the reliability of the most widely adopted SE calibrations, finding that H$\\beta$ yields the closest agreement with RM-based M$_{BH}$ estimates, whereas H$\\alpha$-based estimators exhibit a larger scatter. For the least massive BH in our sample ($M_{BH,RM}$~$10^{7.5}M_\\odot$), which is accreting at a rate close to the Eddington limit ($\\lambda_{Edd}=0.8$), all SE calibrators overestimate M$_{\\rm BH, RM}$ by one order of magnitude. This may indicate a systematic overestimation of M$_{BH}$ for highly accreting BHs at high redshift. Finally, we provide the first high-redshift SE calibration based on H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$. Although a larger sample is needed to reduce the uncertainties, our calibration can already be applied to the newly discovered BH population in the early Universe.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are dense, compact stellar systems only a few parsecs across, located at galaxy centers. Their small sizes make them difficult to resolve spatially. NSCs often coexist with massive black holes, and both trace the dynamical state and evolution of their host galaxies. Dense stellar environments such as NSCs are also ideal sites for forming intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). To date, spatially resolved NSC properties, crucial for reconstructing dynamical and star-formation histories, have only been obtained for galaxies within 5 Mpc, using the highest-resolution instruments on the current class of very large telescopes. This severely limits spectroscopic studies, and a systematic, unbiased survey has never been accomplished. Because the vast majority of known NSCs are located in the Northern Hemisphere, only a 30-m-class telescope in the North can provide the statistical power needed to study their physical properties and measure the mass of coexisting central black holes. We propose leveraging the capabilities of a 30-m-class Northern telescope to obtain the first comprehensive, spatially resolved survey of NSCs, finally allowing us to unveil their formation pathways and their yet unknown connection with central massive black holes.",

Despite the existence of many radio continuum surveys, sensitive and high-angular-resolution single-dish surveys of extended radio continuum emission remain scarce. As part of the GLObal view of STAR formation (GLOSTAR) survey, we will also crucially complement the existing data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) by addressing the missing zero-spacing gap. Within the framework of the GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey, we performed large-scale radio continuum imaging observations toward the Galactic plane in the range $-2^{\\circ}< \\ell <60^{\\circ}$ and $|b|<1.1^{\\circ}$, as well as the Cygnus X region with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope. We present the Effelsberg continuum survey at 4.89GHz and 6.82GHz including linear polarization with angular resolutions of 145$^{\\prime\\prime}$ and 106$^{\\prime\\prime}$, respectively. The survey has been corrected for missing large-scale emission using available low-angular-resolution surveys. Comparison with previous single-dish surveys indicates that our continuum survey represents the highest-quality single-dish data collected to date at this frequency. More than 90\\% of the flux density missed by the VLA D-array data is effectively recovered by the Effelsberg continuum survey. The improved sensitivity and angular resolution of our survey enable reliable mapping of Galactic magnetic field structures, with polarization data that are less affected by depolarization than in previous surveys. The GLOSTAR single-dish continuum data will be released publicly, offering a valuable resource for studying extended objects including HII regions, supernova remnants, diffuse interstellar medium, and Galactic structure.

        "abstract": "The recent 230 GHz observations by the Event Horizon Telescope have resolved the innermost structure of the M87 galaxy, revealing a ring-like feature consistent with thermal synchrotron emission from a magnetized torus surrounding a rotating supermassive black hole. Moreover, Global Millimeter VLBI Array observations at 86 GHz have revealed a larger-scale, edge-brightened jet with clear signatures of non-thermal emission. The theoretical modelling of these observations involves advanced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized accretion disks around rotating black holes, together with the associated synchrotron emission, which is normally treated with simplified expressions for the electron temperature and assuming a purely thermal distribution. However, an important non-thermal component is expected to be present, making the thermal-emission model not only an approximation, but also a source of degeneracy in the modelling. In view of this, we here present the first application of an ab-initio approach to the electron temperature derived from microscopic simulations of turbulent collisionless plasmas. The novel method, which has no tuneable coefficients and is fully specified by the thermodynamical and magnetic properties of the plasma, provides a better description of the jet morphology and width at 86 GHz, as well as of the broadband spectral emission. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating microscopic plasma physics in black-hole imaging and emphasise the crucial role of magnetic reconnection in electron heating and acceleration processes.",

        "abstract": "We conduct a systematic robustness analysis of the hybrid machine learning framework \\texttt{USmorph}, which integrates unsupervised and supervised learning for galaxy morphological classification. Although \\texttt{USmorph} has already been applied to nearly 100,000 $I$-band galaxy images in the COSMOS field ($0.2 < z < 1.2$, $I_{\\mathrm{mag}} < 25$), the stability of its core modules has not been quantitatively assessed. Our tests show that the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) achieves the best performance in preserving structural information when adopting an intermediate network depth, $5\\times5$ convolutional kernels, and a 40-dimensional latent representation. The adaptive polar coordinate transform (APCT) effectively enhances rotational invariance and improves the robustness of downstream tasks. In the unsupervised stage, a bagging clustering number of $K=50$ provides the optimal trade-off between classification granularity and labeling efficiency. For supervised learning, we employ GoogLeNet, which exhibits stable performance without overfitting. We validate the reliability of the final classifications through two independent tests: (1) the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization reveals clear clustering boundaries in the low-dimensional space; and (2) the morphological classifications are consistent with theoretical expectations of galaxy evolution, with both true and false positives showing unbiased distributions in the parameter space. These results demonstrate the strong robustness of the \\texttt{USmorph} algorithm, providing guidance for its future application to the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) mission.",

ULDM is based on exceptionally light particles and yields galactic halos with dense central solitons. This increases the drag experienced by binary SMBH, decreasing merger times and potentially suppressing gravitational radiation from the binary at low frequencies. We develop semi-analytic models for the decay of SMBH binaries in ULDM halos and use current pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements to constrain the ULDM particle mass and its fractional contribution to the dark matter content of the universe. We find a median ULDM particle mass of $7. \\times 10^{-22}$ eV and show that scaling relations suggest that the drag remains effective at relatively low ULDM fractions, which are consistent with all other constraints on the model. Consequently, future pulsar timing measurements will be a sensitive probe of any ULDM contribution to the overall dark matter content of the universe.",

        "abstract": "JWST offers an unprecedented view of optically dark or faint galaxies (OFGs), previously missed by HST. They are likely massive, heavily dust-obscured star-forming galaxies (SFGs) that substantially contribute to the cosmic SFR density at z > 3. To identify drivers of their high dust attenuation and their role in early universe galaxy evolution, we analyse the stellar morphology of 65 OFGs (from 1892 SFGs at 3<4) using NIRCAM/F444W imaging from the PRIMER and CEERS fields. We study correlations between dust attenuation ($A_{v}$) and galaxy properties, like stellar mass, size, and orientation, and compare scaling relations between OFGs and typical SFGs. We find that OFGs are ~8-9 times more massive and ~4 times more dust attenuated than the parent sample. Structurally, OFGs resemble parent SFGs in median $R_e$ and median $\\Sigma_{R_e}$ but may be slightly rounder on average. While $A_v$ strongly correlates with stellar mass, it does not show significant dependence on stellar mass-normalised effective radius and stellar mass surface density, S\\'ersic index, axis ratio, or SFR surface density. The mass-size and mass-surface density relations place OFGs as a higher-mass extension of SFGs, with no concrete proof of evolutionary differences between them. This suggests that OFGs are heavily dust-obscured primarily due to their high stellar masses, which facilitates dust production and retention, with older stellar populations likely contributing as well. Although some OFGs exhibit high $\\Sigma_\\mathrm{{R_e}}$ and occupy regions of the mass-size plane similar to quiescent galaxies, the overall sample is not representative of this. Their current structures resemble typical SFGs, with no concrete signs of rapid compaction. Diversity in their physical properties shows that OFGs span a range of evolutionary states with few showing reduced star formation, while most remain actively star-forming.",

        "abstract": "Standard thermal freeze-out scenarios with QCD-scale interaction rates predict a $uuddss$ sexaquark relic abundance many orders of magnitude below the observed dark matter density, representing a key challenge for sexaquark dark matter models. Additionally, if the maximum post-inflationary temperature never exceeds the QCD confinement scale, the usual thermal/chemical-equilibrium production of the sexaquark near ${T \\sim T_{\\rm QCD} \\simeq 150 \\text{-} 170~\\mathrm{MeV}}$ never occurs. In this work we show that non-thermal mechanisms can naturally overcome this obstacle. Using late-decaying reheatons as a representative case (while noting the broader applicability), we demonstrate that the final abundance is determined by two quantities: the branching fraction into strange-quark-rich matter and the coalescence probability into sexaquarks during the matter-dominated or early radiation-dominated epoch. We provide compact expressions and benchmark calculations for reheating temperatures $T_R \\in [10, 100]~\\mathrm{MeV}$ and reheaton masses above the QCD confinement scale. Unlike the predictive but unsuccessful thermal scenario, non-thermal production is sensitive to injection microphysics, coalescence efficiency, and residual entropy dilution. We delineate the viable parameter space, evaluate collider and precision constraints on representative reheaton models, and derive indirect detection bounds on residual antisexaquark populations. Our results establish non-thermal production as a viable pathway to sexaquark dark matter and highlight broader implications for non-equilibrium mechanisms in the early universe.",

On the observer's screen, the Kerr-minus-Schwarzschild pattern on the direct critical curve is nonzero, strictly odd under spin reversal after a half-turn azimuth relabelling, and tightly confined to a thin annulus. Using backward-shot, Carter-separated geodesics with midpoint RK2 transport, we achieve second-order convergence and degree-scale amplitudes that grow monotonically with spin and inclination (RMS $\\simeq 0.5$--$2^\\circ$ for $a/M\\gtrsim 0.8$, $i\\gtrsim 60^\\circ$). Three independent constructions -- Frenet--Serret line integral, explicit Levi--Civita transport of the polarization vector, and the phase of the Walker--Penrose constant -- agree ray by ray. We then define a parity-odd ring estimator that is intrinsically achromatic after standard wavelength-squared regression, symmetry-protected against common even-parity systematics, and compressed into low azimuthal modes. This yields a minimal two-parameter template (spin and inclination) for mm/sub-mm polarimetry of horizon-scale rings in sources such as M87$^\\ast$ and Sgr~A$^\\ast$.

Head-on collisions of equal-mass stars yield three distinct outcomes - boson star remnants, black hole formation at contact, and collapse of each star to a black hole prior to contact. The associated gravitational-wave energies reflect the competition between increasing compactness and decreasing tidal deformability, and at large self-interaction strengths the collapse-before-contact branch exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic structure. The simulations reported here constitute a substantial catalogue of initial conditions and waveforms, providing a natural basis for neural-network techniques aimed at improving boson star initial data and constructing surrogate models capable of rapidly predicting gravitational-wave signals across an extended parameter space.",

These objects play a crucial role in the dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxies and exhibit pronounced photometric and spectroscopic variability, often quasi-periodic rather than strictly periodic.   Aims. We investigate the variability of the evolved B-type star rho Leo to determine its physical properties, identify the underlying mechanisms driving its variability, and constrain its evolutionary stage.   Methods. We analyse long-term spectroscopic and photometric datasets obtained from multiple sources, including the TESS and Kepler space missions and observations with the 1.5 m telescope in Estonia. Period analysis is performed using the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, Lomb-Scargle pre-whitening, and the Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform. Fundamental stellar parameters are derived by fitting synthetic line profiles computed with the FastWind code to the HARPS spectrum, while the stellar rotation inclination is estimated using the ZPEKTR code.   Results. The He I 6678.151 A line shows significant radial-velocity and line-profile moment variations. We detect a set of periods and harmonics spanning approximately 0.8 to 35 days. Some periods remain stable over time, whereas others vary between observing seasons. A comparison of spectroscopic and photometric variability, together with phase-curve morphology, allows us to constrain the origin of several signals. In particular, the approximately 11 day period is attributed to stellar rotation, while the approximately 17 day period is linked to radial pulsations.   Conclusions. Although the variability is quasi-periodic, most detected periods persist across multiple seasons. The wide range of timescales suggests that rho Leo is likely evolving along a blue loop following the red supergiant phase.",

(3) The role of the environment in the different modes of star formation from compact star clusters to born-this-way associations and from massive clusters to small stellar groups. More specifically, we present the contributions to such science that would be enabled by a 30~m type telescope in the northern hemisphere studying spiral galaxies. Those can be grouped in three: our own Galaxy, the Milky Way; the other two spiral galaxies in the Local Group, M31 and M33; and other galaxies within 25 Mpc, such as M101, M51, and NGC~6946. This work is based on the fact that, as of today, no construction of a 30~m telescope has yet started in the northern hemisphere, so even in the best case scenario of such a hypothetical telescope, its full operation would not start until the late 2030s or early 2040s. It makes no assumptions about its location but supposes an instrumentation development similar to that of ELT.",

        "abstract": "White dwarf binaries are fundamental astrophysical probes. They represent ideal laboratories to test the models of binary evolution, which also apply to the sources of gravitational waves, whose detection led to the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Moreover, their final fate is intimately linked to Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), i.e. the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf following the interaction with a companion star, which have become the fundamental yardsticks on cosmological distance scales and led to the discovery of dark energy and the award of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Finally, white dwarf binaries play a crucial role in influencing star formation and chemical evolution of the Galaxy by injecting energy into, and enriching, the interstellar medium with material ejected during nova eruptions and SN Ia explosions. In the next decade, the advent of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory will lead to the discovery of hundreds of thousands of white dwarf binaries. Nonetheless, the intrinsic faintness of the majority of these systems will prevent their spectroscopic characterisation with the instruments available in the 2030s. Hence ESO's Expanding Horizons call is timely for planning a future transformative facility, capable of delivering phase-resolved spectroscopic observations of faint white dwarf binaries, which are key to advancing our understanding of stellar and Galactic evolution and cosmology.",

        "abstract": "The majority of massive classical Be stars are thought to be binary interactions products. Their rapid rotation and often strong, variable, and emission-line dominated spectrum, make spectroscopic analysis challenging. Hence, robust binary properties and statistical constraints are still lacking for the Be population. In this study, we use seven Be-X-ray binaries, and their orbital periods derived from the X-rays, to investigate the reliability of different spectral lines and numerical methods for the measuring of radial-velocities and orbital period determination of Be stars. We use multi-epoch high-resolution HERMES spectra and compare absorption- and emission-line radial velocities obtained with cross-correlation, line-profile fitting, and the bisector method. Line-profile variability affects the bisector method and line-profile fitting requires model templates that do not encompass the complexity of Be-star line profiles. Therefore, we recommend using cross-correlation: it is independent of models and easily compatible with line blends seen in Be-star spectra. The obtained statistical uncertainty on the radial-velocities from cross-correlation is 0.2-0.3km/s for H$\\alpha$ (emission) and ~5km/s for absorption lines, excluding potential systematics. In general, whether the goal is to do binary statistics of a population or an in-depth study of a specific system, we suggest using emission lines, due to a higher precision and less scatter than absorption lines. Here, H$\\beta$ is preferred over H$\\alpha$ because of its lesser variability. However, large-scale variability may cause large shifts in emission-line radial velocities, resulting in spurious eccentricities. In this case, orbital solutions should ideally be compared to lower-signal absorption lines (if present). Finally, we highlight the need for understanding how companion-disc interactions alter emission-line appearance.",

        "abstract": "A small fraction of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binary black holes (BBHs) will be gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies and galaxy clusters. Strong lensing will produce multiple identical copies of the GW signal arriving at different times. Jana et al.~\\cite{Jana_2023} recently proposed a method to constrain cosmological parameters using strongly lensed GW events detected by next-generation (XG) detectors. The idea is that the number of strongly lensed GW events and the distribution of their lensing time delays encode imprints of the cosmological parameters. From the observed number of lensed GW events (tens of thousands) and their time delay distribution, this method can provide a new probe of cosmology, obtaining information at intermediate redshifts. In this work, we explore the possibility of doing lensing cosmography using upcoming observations of the upgraded LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. This requires incorporating the detector network selection effects in the analysis, which was neglected earlier. We expect dozens of lensed GW events to be detected by upgraded LVK detectors, potentially enabling modest constraints on cosmological parameters. Even with relatively modest numbers of lensed detections, we demonstrate the potential of lensing cosmography. For XG detectors, our revised forecasts are consistent with with the earlier forecasts that neglected the selection effects.",

These changes arise from two mechanisms: churning, which modifies angular momentum, and blurring, which induces eccentric orbits without major angular momentum change. To assess whether churning or blurring dominates the dynamical evolution of Gaia-ESO stars, we refine Galactic chemical-evolution models by constructing finer grids that span a wider age range. Using a generalised additive model (GAM), we estimate stellar birth radii beyond the limits of binned metallicity models and compare them with dynamical parameters derived from Gaia parallaxes and proper motions, and Galpy. Our metallicity-stratified sample, grouped through hierarchical clustering of 21 chemical abundances, reveals clear migratory signatures: metal-rich stars formed in the inner disc preferentially move outwards, while more metal-poor stars formed at larger radii tend to migrate inwards. About 75% of stars show signs of churning, while the remainder are largely undisturbed or shaped by blurring. These patterns vary among chemical groups, likely reflecting interactions with the Galactic bar and spiral arms.",

        "abstract": "Radio pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments using millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are beginning to detect nHz gravitational waves (GWs). MSPs are bright GeV gamma-ray emitters, and all-sky monitoring of about 100 MSPs with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has enabled a gamma-ray Pulsar Timing Array. The GPTA provides a complementary view of nHz GWs because its MSP sample is different, and because the gamma-ray data are immune to plasma propagation effects, have minimal data gaps, and rely on homogeneous instrumentation. To assess GPTA performance for future gamma-ray observatories, we simulated the population of Galactic MSPs and developed a high-fidelity method to predict their gamma-ray spectra. This combination reproduces the properties of the LAT MSP sample, validating it for future population studies. We determined the expected signal from the simulated gamma-ray MSPs for instrument concepts with a wide range of capabilities. We found that the optimal GPTA energy range runs about 0.1 to 5 GeV, but we also examined Compton/MeV instruments. With the caveat that the MSP spectra models are extrapolated beyond observational constraints, we found low signal-to-background ratios, yielding few MSP detections. GeV-band concepts would detect 10$^3$ to 10$^4$ MSPs and achieve GW sensitivity on par with and surpassing the current generation of radio PTAs, reaching the GW self-noise regime. When considering two possible scenarios for the formation of MSPs in the Galactic bulge, the collective signal from which is a potential source of an excess GeV signal observed towards the Galactic center, we find that most of the concepts can both detect this bulge population and distinguish the production channel. In summary, the high discovery potential, strong GW performance, and tremendous synergy with radio PTAs all argue for the pursuit of next-generation gamma-ray pulsar timing.",

Advancing on the mapping speed to detect this faint emission in ground-based astronomy has been a technical challenge for decades. The APEX Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (AMKID) camera was designed to accomplish this task. The instrument is a wide field-of-view camera based on kinetic inductance detectors. It is installed on the 12~meter APEX telescope in Chile at 5.100~meters above see level. The instrument operates dual color, covering simultaneously the 350~GHz and 850~GHz atmospheric windows. It has a large field-of-view of 15.3'x15.3', and an unprecedented number of pixels: 13.952~detectors in the high frequency band and 3.520~detectors in the low frequency band. Here we present a complete description of the instrument design and construction together with results of the successful low frequency array (LFA) commissioning campaign executed during the last year. The LFA performance is in good agreement with design parameters, with detector sensitivity of 2.2~mK$\\sqrt{s}$ and diffraction limited beam sizes of 17.0''. On-sky measurements demonstrate a sensitivity of 70-90~mJy$\\sqrt{s}$ per detector when operating under good atmospheric conditions (PWV below 1.0mm). With this performance the LFA regularly achieve a mapping sensitivity of 25~mJy when mapping a square degree in an hour.   AMKID on APEX with its dual color observing capabilities, high sensitivity, large field-of-view and high angular resolution holds the promise to open a new range of science with the APEX telescope.",

We compare these methods to un-nulled (or standard) cosmic shear at the data vector level and assess whether these methods are able to reduce the bias on cosmological constraints using a Fisher forecast. We find that the nulling techniques considered can have a large impact on reducing the bias on $S_8$ and Dark Energy parameters. The cross-correlation method is effective at reducing biases in $S_8$, but requires additional information from galaxy clustering. The LUnul method is the most aggressive of the methods and hence reduces biases most efficiently as $k_{\\rm max}$ is increased, although this improvement in accuracy comes at the cost of precision. The BNT approach preserves more information than LUnul, and has a more rigorous theoretical grounding. We demonstrate that all three of these methods are effective at mitigating bias, and can be readily applied in forthcoming lensing analyses.",

Moreover,when irradiation-driven mass transfer rate drops below the stable accretion rate,it may lead to the rapid accumulation of sufficient material on shorter time scales to trigger a recurrent nova outburst instead of SSS, thereby also offering an explanation for the origin of short-period recurrent novae.",

A critical gap is therefore emerging: next-generation surveys may produce up to $\\sim10^9$ alerts per year, whereas global spectroscopic follow-up is limited to only $\\sim10^4$--$10^5$ transient spectra annually. We present the concept of spectroscopic alerts: real-time notifications triggered by significant spectral evolution, enabling spectroscopy to act as a discovery channel rather than solely as follow-up.

        "abstract": "Inferring the properties of transiting exoplanet atmospheres relies on comparing models to spectroscopic observations. Atmosphere models, however, make a range of assumptions, from one-dimensional (1D, varying with altitude) radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) to three-dimensional (3D) general circulation models (GCMs). The goal of this investigation is to determine the causes of differences in dayside thermal emission spectra resulting from 3D-GCMs (using SPARC/MITgcm) and 1D-RCE models (using ScCHIMERA). We conduct a one-to-one comparison of 1D-RCE models and 3D-GCMs with the same outgoing bolometric thermal flux over a grid of equilibrium temperatures, gravities, metallicities, and rotation periods. Each 1D-RCE model assumes heat redistribution in the planet's atmosphere consistent with that in the corresponding 3D-GCM's photosphere. Comparing corresponding models, the dayside average pressure-temperature (PT) structures can be broken into four vertical regions, each influencing wavelength-dependent differences in their spectra. Furthermore, the dayside average 3D-GCM PTs for planets with Teq=1400 K exhibit a temperature inversion, whereas corresponding 1D-RCE models do not. We find that spectral differences between 1D-RCE models and 3D-GCMs with the same parameters decrease for hotter planets because the spectral shapes more closely resemble blackbodies. To a lesser extent, spectral differences increase for planets with longer rotation periods because of smaller day-night temperature contrasts in the photosphere. Finally, we compare spectral differences to realistic observational uncertainties from JWST with the NIRISS SOSS, NIRSpec G395H, and MIRI LRS instrument modes. We find that 1D-RCE models and 3D-GCMs with the same parameters can produce dayside spectral differences larger than JWST's uncertainty, potentially biasing data-model inferences.",

It briefly reviews some recent findings obtained from fully kinetic numerical simulations of large-amplitude, semi to fully relativistic turbulence. The paper then argues that these findings can be understood within the framework of a ``generalised Fermi'' picture of stochastic acceleration, which it summarises. The dominant contributions to acceleration appear to arise from particle interactions with sharp, dynamic bends of the magnetic field lines and regions of velocity compression. Interestingly, the acceleration rate is spatially inhomogeneous and its probability distribution follows a broken power law extending up to large values. This makes relativistic, large-amplitude turbulence an extreme particle accelerator. Some implications for particle transport and the shape of the particle energy spectrum in the presence of radiative losses and over long timescales are also discussed.",

So far, RM of the BLR has only been performed for recombination lines responding to the varying ionizing continuum. We tested whether OI 8446, attributed to Bowen fluorescence driven by Ly$\\beta$ pumping, varied on short (day- to week-long) timescales during a 2016 HST/STIS campaign of NGC 4593, and examined how it relates to other emission lines and the ionizing UV continuum. We quantified the variability of OI 8446 by calculating its rms amplitude. We then extracted integrated light curves of OI 8446 and other UV and optical emission lines, and compared them with each other and with the UV continuum light curve using correlation analyses. In addition, we used archival near-infrared spectra to assess the dominant excitation mechanism of OI 8446. We detect, for the first time, variability in OI 8446 on day timescales. The fractional rms amplitude is $\\sim 4$% over the 4-week campaign. The OI 8446 light curve reverberates with a delay of $\\sim 2.5$ days relative to Ly$\\alpha$, used as a proxy for Ly$\\beta$, detected at a false-alarm probability of 0.6% (significance of $\\sim 2.8\\sigma$) under our adopted null hypothesis. It closely tracks H$\\alpha$ with only a minor additional delay of $\\sim0.3$ days, placing its emission region at essentially the same distance as the Balmer-line weighted BLR. Line ratios indicate that Ly$\\beta$ pumping is the dominant excitation mechanism for O I 8446. Our results establish OI 8446 as the first Bowen-fluorescence line reverberation-mapped, responding directly to variations in Ly$\\beta$ flux. We propose that in future campaigns targeting AGN with larger BLRs, O I could enable dual-driver RM using both the continuum and the pumping line as drivers.",

The combination of these datasets is still ongoing and represents a significant investment of time and expertise.   In that IPTA comparison, authors of this letter combined the separate datasets in the standard PTA optimal detection statistic for cross-correlations incoherently, that is, the data was combined without fitting a merged timing model across all PTA datasets, treating datasets of the same pulsar as independent, and neglecting the \"same pulsar, different datasets\" cross-correlations. This work refines that method by extending its core ideas beyond detection statistics and into a full, general data-combination method. We have demonstrated its efficacy and extreme efficiency on simulated data.

This paper presents a novel flare prediction model based on topologically derived photospheric magnetic parameters. We employ the \\texttt{ARTop} framework to compute the time-dependent input rates of magnetic winding and helicity across more than $10^5$ active region (AR) observations, decomposing them into current-carrying and potential components to reduce sensitivity to optical flow methods. An \\texttt{XGBoost} machine learning model is trained on these topological time series, alongside engineered features including rolling statistics, kurtosis, and flare history, to predict the probability of $\\geq$M1.0-class flares within the next 24 hours. The model demonstrates strong performance on a validation set, with a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.804 for once daily operational region forecasts. When applied to a fully independent holdout set, the operational forecast achieves a TSS of \\tsssa. A SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis confirms the model's physical interpretability, identifying flare history and accumulated current-carrying winding and helicity as the most important features. The main challenges identified are false positives arising from ARs with frequent C-class flaring and systematic errors introduced by projection effects when ARs are near the limb. Excluding limb-affected data yields no improvement in the holdout set TSS (\\TSSalert\\ versus \\tsssa), due to the overall decreased number of flares. However, our per-region analysis indicates that mitigating these projection effects is crucial for future operational deployment. This work establishes magnetic topology, particularly its current-carrying components, as a highly effective and physically meaningful set of predictors for solar flare forecasting.",

In specific astronomical use cases, a number of dimensionality reduction techniques, including traditional linear (e.g. principal component analysis) and modern nonlinear methods (e.g. convolutional autoencoders) have been used to tackle this high-dimensional problem. In this study, we assess the strengths, weaknesses, and nuances of various methods in their ability to capture and preserve astronomically-relevant features at lower dimensions. We provide recommendations to guide users in identifying and incorporating these treatments to their data, and provide insights into the computational scalability of these methods for observatory level data processing. This benchmark study uses publicly available archival ALMA data from a diverse sampling of source morphologies and observing setups to assess the performance and trade-offs between computational cost, image reconstruction accuracy, and scalability. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of these techniques in regard to data segmentation and labeling algorithms and how they can be exploited for advanced data product generation and streamlined archival analysis as we prepare to enter the era of the ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade.",

        "abstract": "Relativistic transients such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), jetted tidal disruption events, luminous fast blue optical transients, and fast X-ray transients, represent the brightest explosions in the Universe and serve dual roles as laboratories for extreme physics and as cosmic lighthouses probing the earliest epochs of the Universe. The 2040s will bring transformative capabilities: wide-field optical surveys discovering tens of thousands of optical transients nightly, proposed high-energy missions like THESEUS providing 10-100x improved high-energy monitoring, and third-generation gravitational wave detectors identifying $\\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ compact object mergers annually, many accompanied by relativistic jets. This industrial-scale discovery rate will enable population studies addressing fundamental questions such as jet launching mechanisms, nucleosynthesis, the first stars, and how progenitor environments shape these transients across cosmic time. However, realizing this science requires overcoming a critical bottleneck: these transients evolve on timescales of seconds to days, with their physics encoded in rapidly-changing multi-wavelength signatures demanding immediate spectroscopic characterization down to m ~ 25. Current facilities, optimized for classical/queue scheduling, do not provide the rapid, flexible, multi-target response necessary for industrial-scale follow-up. This white paper demonstrates that without a dedicated large-aperture (10-30 m effective collecting area) time-domain facility with robotic scheduling and optical-NIR spectroscopic capabilities, the transformative potential of relativistic transient science in the 2040s will be considerably limited.",

Based on integral field spectroscopy data for 17 barred galaxies covering approximately the central 6x6 kpc, we detect a total of 2200 HII regions, of which 331 are located within the nuclear disc (also known as circumnuclear regions), 661 in the bar region, and 1208 in the disc. Among the physical properties of the HII regions, we explore the O/H and N/O abundances, H$\\alpha$ luminosity, dust extinction, electron density, and H$\\alpha$ equivalent width. We find clear differences in the properties of the HII regions between the nuclear disc, the bar and the disc, that could be explained by an enhancement in the molecular gas concentration in the central parts driven by bar-induced gas flows. As this gas is channelled towards the galaxy centre, the most extreme values in the analysed properties are found for the circumnuclear HII regions. Unlike the bar strength, galaxy mass does seem to affect the properties of the HII regions, with massive galaxies presenting higher values in most of the properties, possibly due to the increased amount of gas in these systems. This study provides evidence that the bar-driven redistribution of material within the galaxy inner parts causes significant differences in the HII region properties depending on their location within the galaxies.",

Guided by analytic scalings and 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we show that the pulsar \"Fundamental Plane\" (relating gamma-ray luminosity, spectral cutoff energy, spin-down power $\\dot{\\cal{E}}$, and surface magnetic field) is bounded by two regimes: a radiation-reaction-limited branch and a potential-drop-limited branch. Their intersection defines a transition in $\\dot{\\cal{E}}$ that maps to a gamma-ray visibility threshold on the $P-\\dot{P}$ diagram, above which detectability is set by distance and beaming, and below which both cutoff energy and efficiency decline rapidly. Placing ATNF pulsars and McGill magnetars onto these planes reproduces the observed Fermi occupancy, with millisecond pulsars (MSPs) on the observable side, young pulsars (YPs) straddling the threshold, and magnetars clustering at or just below it. At higher $\\dot{\\cal{E}}$, both MSPs and YPs depart from the maximal radiation-reaction-limited envelope at similar cutoff energies, suggesting that enhanced pair creation screens the accelerating electric field in the ECS. We interpret this behavior with a compactness-based criterion for optically thin $\\gamma\\gamma$ pair feedback in or near the ECS and briefly note an extension to $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow\\mu^\\pm$ that could yield pulsed multi-TeV neutrinos in the most energetic systems. The framework predicts an MeV-bright, GeV-faint corridor below current Fermi sensitivity, a target for next-generation MeV missions. Finally, motivated by the recent HESSII detection of pulsed multi-TeV emission from Vela, we use PIC particle distributions with a simple seed-photon model to reproduce a multi-TeV inverse-Compton component alongside the GeV curvature emission, supporting a unified ECS-based GeV-TeV origin.",

        "abstract": "The formation of a compact accretion disk following a tidal disruption event (TDE) requires that the shocked stellar debris cool efficiently as it settles toward the black hole. While recent simulations suggest that stream dissipation occurs rapidly, how the weakly bound debris subsequently loses its thermal energy to assemble a compact disk near the circularization radius remains uncertain. We investigate this cooling process using axisymmetric radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of quasi-hydrostatic 'TDE envelopes', initialized with the total mass, angular momentum, and binding energy expected from a complete stellar disruption. The envelopes, supported by radiation pressure on large scales and rotation near the circularization radius, evolve through a combination of radiative diffusion, turbulent mixing, and polar outflows. In our fiducial model, a quasi-steady state is achieved in which a polar outflow radiates and expels matter at several times the Eddington luminosity. This enables the envelope to cool and contract, forming a dense, rotationally supported ring near the circularization radius, but on a timescale roughly ten times shorter than the naive photon-diffusion timescale. Comparative models without radiation transport confirm that cooling, not purely adiabatic evolution, is essential to driving this rapid inflow. Nevertheless, across a range of envelope masses, the effective envelope cooling time scales only weakly with its optical depth, implying that advective and wind-driven energy transport dominate over diffusion. Our results demonstrate the cooling-induced contraction, even absent viscosity and associated black hole accretion, can produce luminosities and large photosphere radii consistent with early UV/optical TDE emission. However, more quantitative light-curve predictions must incorporate self-consistent formation and feeding of the envelope by fall-back accretion.",

In this work, we investigate two distinct physical scenarios for the origin of bulk viscosity: (1) nonminimal interactions between two fluids, and (2) elastic collisions in an ideal gas. In both cases, we demonstrate that while the associated energy-momentum exchange can significantly influence fluid dynamics, overall energy-momentum conservation precludes such exchange from having any direct gravitational effect in the context of General Relativity. In case (1), we show that the standard bulk viscous energy-momentum tensor can be obtained for the two-fluid system only at the cost of the violation of all classical energy conditions: null, weak, dominant, and strong. In case (2), we consider a single fluid composed of point particles undergoing instantaneous, energy- and momentum-conserving collisions, and find that the proper pressure remains strictly non-negative, with the equation-of-state parameter confined to the interval $[0,1/3]$. In both scenarios, achieving a sufficiently negative effective pressure to drive cosmic acceleration requires assumptions that compromise the physical viability of the model.

A new analytic model is developed using characteristic energies -- particularly the energy deposited in overlapping regions of the colliding bodies -- to accurately describe the mass of the largest and second-largest remnants. The model successfully reproduces simulation results across a broad range of impact conditions and improves on previous models by better capturing the transitions between ``merging'', ``hit-and-run'', and disruption. We also derive outcome formulas averaged over impact-parameter-weighted angular distributions, enabling more realistic applications to integrated modeling of planet formation.

        "abstract": "Over the last 15 years, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionized astrophysics by providing unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in observing the cold universe, including the formation of stars, planets, and galaxies. With groundbreaking discoveries ranging from the first detailed images of protoplanetary disks to the kinematics of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization, ALMA has showcased the vast discovery potential of the (sub-)mm wavelength regime. However, in another 15 years from now--in the 2040s--the science landscape will have changed dramatically as new major observational facilities will have started their operations or have come towards advanced maturity in their scientific outcome (e.g., JWST, Rubin Observatory, ELT, Euclid, Gaia, Plato, Ariel, Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, LiteBIRD, LISA, SKA and others). At the same time, ALMA's current Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade will have been in place for ~10 years, and ALMA itself will have been operational for 30 years. To fully exploit this era, the community needs a next-generation facility operating at (sub-)mm wavelengths with capabilities far beyond those possible within ALMA's current infrastructure.   To this end, ALMA2040 is a community-driven initiative to define the key scientific questions of the 2040s and translate them into a technical vision for a next-generation transformational (sub-)millimeter facility. Our goal with this document is to summarize the current status of the effort, synthesize outcomes from the 2025 workshops, outline next steps toward a reference design concept, and invite broad participation from the global mm/sub-mm community to help shape this future facility.   In the following we provide details on the process and scope. We invite everyone who wishes to join the effort and/or contribute to the dedicated White Papers planned for 2026.",

        "abstract": "The FU Orionis star V883 Ori provides a unique opportunity to probe the water snowline in a protoplanetary disk. During an accretion burst, the enhanced stellar luminosity heats the disk, sublimating ices and bringing volatile species into the gas-phase. The water snowline, located at $\\sim$80 au in the midplane, represents a key boundary for dust growth and volatile delivery to forming planets. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 7 observations of V883 Ori that detect two targeted water isotopologue transitions: para-H$_2$$^{18}$O $5_{1,5}$-$4_{2,2}$ at 322 GHz and HDO $3_{3,1}$-$4_{2,2}$ at 335 GHz. After correcting for Keplerian rotation, we detect HDO and H$_2$$^{18}$O at 23.6$\\sigma$ and 9.3$\\sigma$, respectively. Rotational-diagram analysis using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach yields $T_\\mathrm{rot}=116.89\\pm12.81$ K and $N=(4.90\\pm1.69)\\times10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for H$_2$$^{18}$O, and $T_\\mathrm{rot}=87.46\\pm4.95$ K and $N=(4.47\\pm0.62)\\times10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for HDO. These results imply water vapor abundances of $N_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}/N_{\\mathrm{H_2}}\\sim3\\times10^{-7}$-$5\\times10^{-6}$ and an HDO/H$_2$O ratio of $(0.4$-$2.0)\\times10^{-3}$ just inside the water snowline, broadly consistent with inheritance from protostellar envelopes. The HDO line in Band 7 is significantly weaker than predicted from Band 6 extrapolation, showing only $\\sim$26% of the expected strength. This attenuation can be explained by a more compact, hotter emitting region with an effective radius of $\\sim$53 au and/or frequency-dependent dust absorption that enlarges the apparent inner cavity at higher frequency. Our results highlight both the diagnostic power of water isotopologue lines and the need for higher angular resolution observations to resolve the water snowline and test these scenarios.",

In this study, we analyze full-field MIRI imager observations at 21 $\\mu$m (F2100W) to quantify detector persistence following a saturation event by a bright (K = 5.65 mag) nearby (8.12 $\\pm$ 0.04 pc) mid M-dwarf star, IRAS 21500+5903. Unlike typical persistence that appears as excess flux, this effect presents as a flux deficit in pixels previously illuminated by the saturating or near saturating source. We measure persistence at two post-saturation epochs: shortly after saturation (11.6 minutes) and an hour later (1.39 hours). Immediately after the saturation event, we detect a persistence level of $1.69 \\pm 0.10$%. By fitting a Bayesian exponential decay model to the two epochs, we estimate that persistence decreases to one-tenth of its initial value after $5.16^{+1.49}_{-0.94}$ hours. We examine the implications of persistence for MIRI high-contrast imaging using the imager (not coronagraphy). Specifically, we discuss how MIRI detector persistence can produce false-positive exoplanet signals in direct imaging surveys, as well as degrade PSF subtraction, particularly at small inner working angles. We also outline mitigation strategies to avoid these impacts in future observations.",

        "abstract": "Large solar flares (GOES M-class or higher) are usually associated with eruptions of material. However, when considering flare irradiance enhancements and dynamics such as chromospheric evaporation, potential contributions from erupted material have historically been neglected. We analyse nine eruptive M- and X-class flares from 2024 to early 2025, quantifying the relative contributions of erupted material to irradiance enhancements during the events. SDO/AIA images from four different channels had ribbon and eruption irradiance contributions separated using a semi-automated masking method. The sample-averaged percentages of excess radiated energy by erupted material over the impulsive phase were $10^{+4}_{-4}\\%$, $24^{+14}_{-14}\\%$, $21^{+14}_{-10}\\%$ and $13^{+6}_{-9}\\%$ for the $131\\,$\\r{A}, $171\\,$\\r{A}, $304\\,$\\r{A} and $1600\\,$\\r{A} channels, respectively. For three events that were studied in further detail, HXR imaging showed little to no signatures of nonthermal heating within the eruptions. Our results suggest that erupted material can be a significant contributor to UV irradiance enhancements during flares, with possible heating mechanisms including nonthermal particle heating, Ohmic heating, or dissipation of MHD waves. Future work may clarify the heating mechanism and evaluate the impact of eruptions on spectral variability, particularly in Sun-as-a-star and stellar flare observations.",

        "abstract": "A high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observation was made of the RS CVn-type binary star HR 1099 using the Resolve instrument onboard XRISM for its calibration purposes. During the $\\sim$400 ks telescope time covering 1.5 binary orbit, a flare lasting for $\\sim$100 ks was observed with a released X-ray radiation energy of $\\sim 10^{34}$ erg, making it the first stellar flare ever observed with an X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer. The flare peak count rate is 6.4 times higher than that in quiescence and is distinguished clearly in time thanks to the long telescope time. Many emission lines were detected in the 1.7--10 keV range both in the flare and quiescent phases. Using the high spectral resolution of Resolve in the Fe K band (6.5--7.0 keV), we resolved the inner-shell lines of Fe XIX--XXIV as well as the outer-shell lines of Fe XXV--XXVI. These lines have peaks in the contribution functions at different temperatures over a wide range, allowing us to construct the differential emission measure (DEM) distribution over the electron temperature of 1--10 keV (roughly 10--100 MK) based only on Fe lines, thus without an assumption of the elemental abundance. The reconstructed DEM has a bimodal distribution, and only the hotter component increased during the flare. The elemental abundance was derived based on the DEM distribution thus constructed. A significant abundance increase was observed during the flare for Ca and Fe, which are some of the elements with the lowest first ionization potential among those analyzed, but not for Si, S, and Ar. This behavior is seen in some giant solar flares and the present result is a clear example in stellar flares.",

        "abstract": "Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are major drivers of heliospheric variability and can produce prolonged disturbances near Earth. Understanding their thermodynamic evolution is crucial for assessing their heat budget and exploring how thermal states relate to their plasma dynamics and geoeffectiveness. We conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of magnetic ejecta (MEs) over Solar Cycles 23, 24, and the ascending phase of 25. Leveraging a polytropic framework, we characterized the thermal state of ME based on the event-wise median proton polytropic index (Gamma_p) from in-situ measurements at 1 AU. We find that MEs are thermodynamically active and rarely evolve adiabatically or isothermally. Notably, a significant fraction (45%) of MEs exhibit a heating state. Heating MEs dominate near solar maxima and exhibit strong solar-cycle modulation in Gamma_p, proton temperature, and expansion speed, indicating active in-transit heating processes. Whereas, Cooling MEs show a nearly constant Gamma_p = 2 across cycles, suggesting enhanced cooling beyond adiabatic expectations and possible thermal energy retention from eruption to 1 AU. Notably, the median Gamma_p value increases from 1.49 (SC23) to 1.88 (SC24), indicating a shift to cooling-dominated states over successive cycles. High-impact ICMEs, predominantly Heating MEs (Gamma_p = 0.59), often manifest as magnetic clouds with enhanced magnetic fields, low plasma beta, pronounced sheath compression, elevated expansion, and post-ICME high-speed flows, making them the most geoeffective drivers of strong geomagnetic storms. These results establish Gamma_p as a useful diagnostic of ICME thermal states, though meaningful assessment of geoeffectiveness requires combined consideration of thermal, plasma, and magnetic field properties.",

The daily composite time series of Ca II K plage areas from 1907 February 1 to 2023 December 31 is used to analyze its periodicity and examine the temporal variation of its rotation period lengths (RPLs) using continuous wavelet transform. Wavelet analysis reveals that over a time span of more than a century, chromospheric rotation exhibits a dominant synodic period of approximately 26.62 days, with complex temporal variations. The long-term trend of chromospheric rotation is well-characterized by a statistically significant quadratic polynomial, showing a gradual deceleration from solar cycles 15 to 19, followed by a gradual acceleration from cycles 19 to 24. The RPLs exhibit a negative correlation between the rotation rate of the chromosphere and solar magnetic activity. Their behavior follows a distinct pattern within a Schwabe cycle: the rotation period progressively lengthens during the initial approximately 3 years, then maintains a relatively long value from year 3 to approximately 7.5, and finally shortens during the declining phase, returning to a minimum near the subsequent solar minimum. The variations of chromospheric RPLs show significant periods of 3.2, 5.7, 7.7, 10.3, and 12.3 years, with cross-correlation analysis pointing to a complex relationship with solar activity. The possible mechanisms for the temporal variation of the chromospheric rotation are discussed.",

Upcoming surveys will discover vast numbers of new objects, yet their scientific value will depend on follow-up observations requiring far greater sensitivity and resolution than those currently available. A 30-m class telescope like the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will be transformative, but its Southern location will leave significant regions of the sky poorly covered or even non accessible. A Northern 30-40m telescope is therefore essential to achieve full-sky coverage and fully exploit the small body discoveries of the 2030-2050 era, in particular for targets of opportunity or unexpected discoveries, like those of interstellar objects and potentially hazardous asteroids, as well as for distant trans-Neptunian objects and space mission targets.",

        "abstract": "In solar atmosphere, magnetic reconnection alters the topological connectivity, and magnetic energy is released. However, the length change of the reconnecting structures has rarely been reported. To identify the evolution of the topological structures, we search for reconnection events which should satisfy 3 criteria. (1) Each event displays an explicit X-type configuration, and the configuration consists of two sets of independent atmospheric structures, (2) the reconnection process is clearly observed, and (3) the topological connectivity of the structures can be tracked from at least 5 minutes prior to the occurrence of magnetic reconnection to 5 minutes after the reconnection. In this work, 3 events are selected and studied. During the reconnection moment, the total length of the two topological structures in each event shortens suddenly, and the decrements for events 1--3 are 47 Mm, 3.7 Mm, and 8.2 Mm, respectively, implying that partial structures vanish observationally during magnetic reconnection process. Several possibilities about the vanishment, e.g. the shrinkage of the reconnecting structures due to magnetic tension, the bizarre change in the third dimension, and magnetic field annihilation, have been discussed.",

Uranus' declination favors observations from the Northern Hemisphere until 2055, and Neptune will be favored from the Northern Hemisphere from 2027 for the next 90 years. Jupiter and Saturn experience cycles of better observability from either hemisphere on cycles of 10 and 30 years. These planets and their satellite systems often offer unique opportunities for discovery through time-critical observations. We argue that a 30-m class size telescope in the Northern Hemisphere with complementary scientific instrumentation to that on the ELT will secure the possibility of observing high-impact unpredictable phenomena in these systems.",

In this analysis, we propose an estimation of the usefulness of dedicated astronomical observation for spacecraft monitoring, identification, and deduction of orbital parameters. We use astronomical data from the Astronomical Observatory Meshtitsa (Bulgaria) and the https://www.tycho-tracker.com/ software for the streak analysis.

We report a comprehensive environmental characterisation of the Bedretto tunnel in Ticino, Switzerland, a site offering horizontal access, excellent infrastructure, and the potential to be be Europe's second-deepest and quietest underground laboratory. At the prospective physics site, located beneath an overburden exceeding 1400 m, we measure the cosmic-muon, gamma-ray, and neutron fluxes, as well as the radon concentration, magnetic-field spectrum, and seismic backgrounds. The muon flux is suppressed by six orders of magnitude relative to the surface, consistent with an effective depth of about 4000 metre water equivalent, gamma-ray and neutron measurements reflect the local geology and guide shielding requirements for future particle and nuclear physics experiments. Magnetic and seismic noise levels are found to be exceptionally low, meeting or exceeding the criteria for next-generation atom-interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. These results establish the site as a highly competitive, accessible deep-underground location for fundamental-physics experiments.",

        "abstract": "This work aims to choose potential astronomical sites that can be candidates for a new astronomical optical observatory in Ethiopia, in addition to the Entoto Observatory and Lalibela sites. For our primary investigation, the six basic criteria, namely the altitude of the mountains, artificial light pollution, cloud coverage, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction, are taken into account. Consequently, using the multi-criteria statistical analysis (MCSA) techniques, 21 high-potential places are selected and presented for further investigation out of 367 mountains. Those selected mountains are mapped and presented to study the future of the astronomical seeing effect. This study may contribute to the protection of those potential astronomical sites and their dark skies and the development of astrotourism for the sustainable development of modern astronomy in Ethiopia and in the East African region.",

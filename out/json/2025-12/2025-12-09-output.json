        "abstract": "The SMC is in disequilibrium. Gas line-of-sight (LoS) velocity maps show a gradient of $60-100$ km s$^{-1}$, generally interpreted as a rotating gas disk consistent with the Tully-Fisher relation. Yet, the stars don't show rotation. Despite a small on-sky extent ($\\sim4$ kpc), the SMC exhibits a large ($\\sim10$ kpc) LoS depth, and the stellar photometric center is offset from the HI kinematic center by $\\sim$1 kpc. With N-body hydrodynamical simulations, we show that a recent ($\\sim$100 Myr ago) SMC-LMC collision (impact parameter $\\sim2$ kpc) explains the observed SMC's internal structure and kinematics. The simulated SMC is initialized with rotating stellar and gaseous disks. Post-collision, the SMC's tidal tail accounts for the large LoS depth. The SMC's stellar kinematics become dispersion dominated ($v/\\sigma\\approx0.2$), with radially outward motions at $R>2$ kpc, and a small ($<10$ km s$^{-1}$) remnant rotation at $R<2$ kpc, consistent with observations. Post-collision gas kinematics are also dominated by radially outward motions, without remnant rotation. Hence, the observed SMC's gas LoS velocity gradient is due to radial motions as opposed to disk rotation. Ram pressure from the LMC's gas disk during the collision imparts $\\approx30$ km s$^{-1}$ kick to the SMC's gas, sufficient to destroy gas rotation and offset the SMC's stellar and gas centers. Our work highlights the critical role of group processing through galaxy collisions in driving dIrr to dE/dSph transformation, including the removal of gas. Consequently, frameworks that treat the SMC as a galaxy in transformation are required to effectively use its observational data to constrain interstellar medium and dark matter physics.",

        "abstract": "We compare satellite quenched fractions across three cosmological simulation suites (FIREbox, the FIRE-2 zoom-ins, and IllustrisTNG50) and observational datasets from SAGA, ELVES, and the combined satellite population of the Milky Way and M31. To enable consistent comparisons, we select Milky Way-mass hosts with $M_{\\rm halo} = 10^{11.9}$ - $10^{12.2} \\, M_{\\odot}$ and satellites with stellar masses of $10^{7}$ - $10^{10}\\, M_{\\odot}$, applying uniform projected apertures and a common quenching definition. All three simulations reproduce the strong observed trend that lower-mass satellites are more likely to be quenched, closely matching the stellar-mass dependence seen in SAGA, ELVES, and the MW+M31 system. This agreement indicates that the mass dependence of satellite quenching is a robust outcome of contemporary galaxy formation models. Radial trends, however, show meaningful differences. SAGA and ELVES exhibit gently declining quenched fractions with projected distance, reflecting strong environmental quenching at small radii. TNG50 most closely matches this behavior, FIREbox, remains consistent with with a nearly flat trend within uncertainties, and the FIRE-2 zoom-ins show suppressed inner quenched fractions driven almost entirely by their paired MW-M31 hosts, which lack high-mass satellites and show strong radial segregation between star-forming and quenched systems. This environmental imprint suggests that host environment and assembly history can influence satellite quenching outcomes and may contribute to diversity across simulations. Overall, while the simulations consistently recover the stellar-mass dependence of quenching their radial trends vary, highlighting the influence of host-halo conditions and motivating deeper exploration of how host environments shape satellite quenching.",

        "abstract": "This work investigates the presence and evolution of the MZhR from redshift z=3.5 to z=0, and identifies when galaxies settle on the present-day MZhR. We used central galaxies with log10(Mgal/Msun)=[9,11] from CIELO simulations. We identified stellar halos, from z=3.5 to z=0, using the AM-E method, focusing on the region between the 1.5 optical radius and the virial radius. We presented halo cardiograms, a novel approach to studying the assembly history of stellar halos. Using them, we defined a stability time (tst) as the first time that the median halo metallicity does not change more than \\pm 0.1 dex with respect to its value at z=0. CIELO stellar halos reproduce the present-day observed MZhR. At z=3.5, stellar halos already define an MZhR whose slope is similar to the slope at z=0. For a fixed stellar halo mass, the metallicity increases ~0.21 dex from z=3.5 to z=0, reflecting the progressive chemical enrichment provided by the accretion of satellites with diverse masses and different levels of enrichment. When the first stellar halo main contributor (SHMC1) provides a mass fraction at least 20% higher than the remaining contributors, the stellar halo metallicity is set once SHMC1 is fully disrupted (tmerger). This yields a clear correlation between tst and tmerger, with a scatter of 2.2 Gyr driven by the relative importance of the second and third main contributing satellites. We provide two observational tracers for tst: t90 and a stability time from the age-metallicity relation. Our results suggest that estimating tst could serve as a proxy for dating the moment at which the stellar halo reaches the present-day MZhR, as well as for dating the last major merger that builds them. Combined with an estimation of the merger time of the main contributing satellite, it can provide insights into the relative importance of the second and third contributing satellites. (abridged)",

Using three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson simulations of multiple soliton mergers, we explore both repulsive and attractive regimes across a wide range of scattering lengths. Our results show that repulsive self-interactions lead to more massive and extended cores with lower central densities compared to the free (non-interacting) fuzzy dark matter case, while attractive interactions enhance central densities and can drive cores toward collapse, once a critical mass is exceeded. We confirm that the mass-radius relation of solitonic cores is well described by analytical predictions, even in the presence of self-interactions, and we extend the core-halo mass relation to scenarios beyond fuzzy dark matter. We find that the scaling relations between core mass, size, and total energy are not universal but depend sensitively on the strength and sign of the self-interaction, as well as on the evolutionary stage of the halo. These results demonstrate that self-interactions provide a natural mechanism to regulate core properties, with important implications for the formation of supermassive black holes and for potential astrophysical signatures in galactic cores.",

        "abstract": "In hierarchical structure formation, the content of a galaxy is determined both by its in-situ processes and by material added via accretions. Globular clusters in particular represent a window for the study of the different merger events that a galaxy underwent. Establishing the correct classification of in-situ and accreted tracers, and distinguishing the various different progenitors that contributed to the accreted population are important tools to deepen our understanding of galactic formation and evolution. Our aim is to refine our knowledge of the assembly history of the Milky Way by studying the dynamics of its globular cluster population and establishing an updated classification among in-situ objects and the different merger events identified. We used a custom built orbit integrator to derive precise orbital parameters, integrals of motions and adiabatic invariants for the globular cluster sample studied. By properly accounting for the rotating bar, which transforms the underlying model in a time-varying potential, we proceeded to a complete dynamical characterisation of the globular clusters. We present a new catalogue of clear associations between globular clusters and structures (both in-situ and accreted) in the Milky Way, and a full table of derived parameters. By using all dynamical information available, we were able to attribute previously unassociated or misclassified globular clusters to the different progenitors, including those responsible for the Aleph, Antaeus, Cetus, Elqui, and Typhon merger events. By using a custom built orbit integrator and properly accounting for the time-varying nature of the Milky Way potential, we have shown the depth of information that can be extracted from a purely dynamical analysis of the globular clusters of our Galaxy.",

We find that radial alignment is substantially stronger than orbital alignment, with both signals being consistently stronger for subhalos than for satellites. Interestingly, inward- and outward-moving satellites/subhalos show contrasting orbital alignment behaviors, which can be understood in terms of their radial alignment, orbit decay due to dynamical friction and the effect of tidal stripping. The orbital alignment is stronger in more massive halos. In the end, we explore the orbital alignment measured by a mock observer, and find that the alignment reported by Pace et al.

Three nights of precise (70 cm/s) radial velocity (RV) asteroseismology with the Keck Planet Finder clearly detect 5-minute oscillations from the primary HR 7672A, and modeling of the frequency spectrum yields an asteroseismic age of $1.87\\pm0.65$ Gyr. We also determine a gyrochronological age of $2.58\\pm0.47$ Gyr, and we combine these two results for a final age of $2.26\\pm0.40$ Gyr. In addition, we obtained new RVs for HR 7672A and new astrometry for the companion HR 7672B. From a joint orbit fit, we measured a dynamical mass of $1.111\\pm0.017$ $M_\\odot$ for HR 7672A and $75.39\\pm0.67$ $M_{\\rm Jup}$ for HR 7672B. This places the companion near the stellar/substellar boundary and thus particularly sensitive to differences in model predictions. The joint precision in host star age (18\\% uncertainty) and companion mass (0.9\\% uncertainty) makes HR 7672AB an exceptional substellar benchmark. Combined with the companion's luminosity, we use these measurements to test predictions from six brown dwarf cooling models. The best agreement occurs with the Chabrier et al. (2023) models, which incorporate a new equation of state, resulting in predictions that agree within $<$0.3$\\sigma$ with all the observations. The other 5 sets of models agree at the 1--3$\\sigma$ level depending on the particular test, and some models struggle to predict a sufficient low luminosity for HR 7672B at any age given its dynamical mass. Finally, we detected a weak seismic signal in near-simultaneous TESS photometry of HR 7672A, with the resulting RV-to-photometry oscillation amplitude ratio consistent with solar values.",

        "abstract": "Strong gravitational lensing can reveal the influence of dark-matter substructure in galaxies, but analyzing these effects from noisy, low-resolution images poses a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a masked autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on simulated strong-lensing images from the DeepLense ML4SCI benchmark to learn generalizable representations for two downstream tasks: (i) classifying the underlying dark matter model (cold dark matter, axion-like, or no substructure) and (ii) enhancing low-resolution lensed images via super-resolution. We pretrain a Vision Transformer encoder using a masked image modeling objective, then fine-tune the encoder separately for each task. Our results show that MAE pretraining, when combined with appropriate mask ratio tuning, yields a shared encoder that matches or exceeds a ViT trained from scratch. Specifically, at a 90% mask ratio, the fine-tuned classifier achieves macro AUC of 0.968 and accuracy of 88.65%, compared to the scratch baseline (AUC 0.957, accuracy 82.46%). For super-resolution (16x16 to 64x64), the MAE-pretrained model reconstructs images with PSNR ~33 dB and SSIM 0.961, modestly improving over scratch training. We ablate the MAE mask ratio, revealing a consistent trade-off: higher mask ratios improve classification but slightly degrade reconstruction fidelity. Our findings demonstrate that MAE pretraining on physics-rich simulations provides a flexible, reusable encoder for multiple strong-lensing analysis tasks.",

        "abstract": "We present a first-of-its-kind analysis of the metal content across two interstellar medium (ISM) phases in a sample of 31 local star-forming galaxies from the COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY), selected as analogues of high-$z$ systems. Using co-spatial UV absorption and optical emission-line spectroscopy, we compare abundances of N, O, S, and Fe in the low-ionization (neutral) and high-ionization (ionized) gas, providing a multi-phase view of enrichment shortly after the current starburst and over longer timescales when ejecta from previous episodes have cooled and mixed. We find that O and S, produced predominantly in short-lived massive stars, are well mixed between the two phases, with scatter reflecting local inhomogeneities. Fe, predominantly produced by Type Ia supernovae on $\\sim$1 Gyr timescales, is higher in the neutral gas, reflecting either delayed mixing of older Fe-enriched material or preferential depletion of Fe from the ionized phase through dust formation in core-collapse supernova ejecta. N exhibits the largest phase offset, with N/H$_{ion}$ systematically $\\sim$0.7 dex higher than N/H$_{neu}$, and the magnitude of this offset correlates with stellar mass, metallicity, star-formation rate, and most strongly with the ISM outflow velocity. N/O ratios in the ionized phase rise rapidly within 3-6 Myr relative to the neutral gas, consistent with N enrichment dominated by Wolf-Rayet stars rather than intermediate-mass AGB stars on longer timescales. These results demonstrate that localized stellar feedback, outflows, and phase-dependent mixing collectively regulate the chemical evolution of star-forming galaxies, providing key insight into the extreme N/O abundances recently observed in galaxies at cosmic dawn.",

In this work, we analyze over 700 GMFs identified from synthetic CO emission maps of a high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy, whose lengths range from $\\sim 10$ pc to $\\sim 300$ pc. We find that turbulent shock from galactic shear and stellar feedback are the primary drivers of GMF formation. Magnetized turbulence dominates their internal dynamics, supporting the filaments against global collapse while simultaneously inducing fragmentation into dense clumps. This fragmentation follows the turbulence-driven sausage instability model, rather than pure Jeans instability, and triggers efficient star formation along the filaments. Cloud-cloud collisions are frequent, affecting more than $70\\%$ of GMFs, and often disrupt or reshape their morphology. The typical filamentary lifetime is $t_{\\text{fil}} \\sim 14$ Myr, comparable to the crossing time of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). The molecular gas half-life is $\\sim 7$ Myr, similar to that of GMCs, indicating that GMFs are transient but dynamically important structures.",

We select a 330-galaxy sample from IllustrisTNG50 (TNG50) matched to 33 FEASTS galaxies by stellar and HI masses, and mock observe them to the FAST resolution and depth at corresponding inclinations and distances for a fair comparison. In contrast to FEASTS, abnormally irregular and extended morphology is found in more than one-third of TNG50 galaxies, especially those massive and HI poor. Stellar feedback is the property that most significantly correlates with the HI morphological deviation from observations, although these deviations mostly occur at a high stellar or black-hole mass. These results indicate that in TNG50, stellar feedback significantly influences the HI morphology at $10^{18}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$, while active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback has not so direct a role as expected.

        "abstract": "Connecting high-redshift galaxies to their low-redshift descendants is one of the most important and challenging tasks of galaxy evolution studies. In this work, we investigate whether incorporating high-redshift environmental factors improves the accuracy of matching high-redshift galaxies to their $z\\sim0$ descendants, using data from the EAGLE and MAGNETICUM simulations. Using random forest regression, we evaluate the relative importance of a set of environmental metrics at $z\\sim3$ in determining the stellar mass of descendant galaxies at $z\\sim0$. We identify the spherical overdensity within 1 cMpc ($\\delta_{1,\\mathrm{sp}}$) as the most important environmental predictor. Tracking galaxies at $z\\sim3$ with similar initial stellar masses but different $\\delta_{1,\\mathrm{sp}}$ values, we find that, across all mass bins in both simulations, high-density environments produce $z\\sim0$ descendants with median stellar masses up to eight times higher than the descendants of galaxies in low-density environments. For galaxies with $M_{*}\\lesssim10^{10}M_{\\odot}$, the difference is attributable to more merger-induced mass growth in high-density environments, whereas for higher-mass galaxies, it results from a combination of enhanced in-situ star formation and greater external mass accretion. By assessing the importance of overdensity across multiple scales and redshifts, we find that at $z\\gtrsim2$, environmental factors become as important as stellar mass in predicting the stellar mass of $z\\sim0$ descendants. Compared to using stellar mass at $z\\sim3$ alone, incorporating $\\delta_{1,\\mathrm{sp}}$ reduces the scatter in the residuals between the predicted and actual stellar masses by approximately 20% in EAGLE and 35% in MAGNETICUM.",

The winds of those stars collide and are accreted, at a rate that depends on their chemical composition. Here we aim to revisit the evolutionary status of the evolved massive stars at the GC, by means of new tracks based on updated mass-loss rate recipes for the earlier stages of massive stars.   We use the Geneva-evolution-code for initial stellar masses ranging from 20 to 60 $M_\\odot$, for metallicity $Z=0.020$. We adopt a new mass-loss rate recipe for the line-driven winds of O-type stars and B-supergiants, plus a new recipe for the dust-driven winds of red supergiants (RSG). Additionally, we set up initial rotation $\\Omega/\\Omega_\\text{crit}=0.4$, and we adopt the Ledoux criterion for the treatment of convection in inner layers.   We found that evolution models adopting new mass-loss rate prescriptions predict that stars will lose less of their outer layers during their initial phases, while a big reduction of mass happens at the RSG phase. As a consequence, the resulting Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are less radially homogeneous in their inner structure from the core to the surface. Also, these new evolution models predict the absence of hydrogen-free WN stars. These evolutionary predictions agree better with the observed chemical abundances of the WR stars at the GC.   We provide a table with the chemical H, He, and CNO abundances calculated for the different subtypes of WR stars. We propose a different re-arrangement of the WR subtypes to be used for the modelling of the collision of their winds. We discuss the potential implications of these changes for the colliding winds generated from the massive stars at the GC, which are accreting onto the supermassive black hole Sgr A*.",

Recent evidence suggests that the Sun might have formed through this process. However, the chemical conditions of shock-induced star forming region remain poorly constrained. We study the chemical complexity of a shock-impacted clump, with potential to yield star formation, named the Clump, and located at the interface between the SNR W44 and the infrared dark cloud G034.77-00.55. We test whether the Clump has chemical properties consistent with those observed in star forming regions unaffected by SNRs. We use high-sensitivity, broad spectral surveys at 3 and 7 mm obtained with the 30m antenna at IIRAM and the 40 m YEBES antenna, to identify D-bearing species and complex organic molecules (COMs) toward the Clump. For all species, we estimate molecular abundances and compare them with those observed across star forming regions at different evolutionary stages and masses, as well as comets. We detect multiple deuterated molecules (DCO+, DNC, DCN, CH2DOH) and COMs (CH3OH, CH3CHO, CH3CCH, CH3CN, CH3SH) with excitation temperatures of 5-13 K. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detection of COMs toward a site of SNR-cloud interaction. The derived D/H ratios (0.01-0.04) and COM abundances are consistent with those reported toward typical low-mass starless cores and comparable to cometary values. The overall level of chemical complexity is relatively low, in line with an early evolutionary stage. We suggest that the Clump is a early stage shock-induced low-mass star forming region, not yet protostellar. We speculate that SNR shocks may set the physical and chemical conditions to form stars.

The code is a development of the AGAMA software package for action-based galaxy modelling and can be downloaded as the AGAMAb code library. Although coded in C++, most of its functions can be accessed from Python. We add to the package functions that facilitate confronting models with data, which involve sky coordinates, lines of sight, distances, extinction, etc. The new torus generator can produce tori for both highly eccentric and nearly circular orbits that lie beyond the range of the earlier torus-mapping code. Tori can be created by interpolation between tori at very low cost. Tori are fundamentally devices for computing ordinary phase-space coordinates from angle-action coordinates, but AGAMAb includes an action finder that returns angle-action coordinates from any given phase-space location. This action finder yields the torus through the given point, so it includes the functionality of an orbit integrator. The action finder is more accurate and reliable but computationally more costly than the widely used Staeckel Fudge. We show how AGAMAb can be used to generate sophisticated but cheap models of tidal streams and use it to analyse data for the GD1 stream. With the most recently published distances to the stream, energy and angular momentum imply that the end that must be leading is trailing, but extremely small changes to the distances rectify the problem.",

Specifically, we propose measuring the two-point cross-correlation between RM squared, ${\\rm RM}^2$, towards background sources and the projected density field of foreground galaxies, $\\langle {\\rm RM}^2 \\times {\\rm g} \\rangle$, as a function of transverse separation. This statistic is analogous to the ''projected fields'' estimator used for the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, $\\langle {\\rm kSZ}^2 \\times {\\rm g} \\rangle$. Our estimator avoids contamination, and is also free from the noise bias that arises when correlating the absolute value of the RMs with galaxies. Moreover, by binning in foreground galaxy redshifts, $\\langle {\\rm RM}^2 \\times {\\rm g} \\rangle$ enables a tomographic reconstruction of the redshift evolution of large-scale cosmic magnetic fields. We model this statistic using the Illustris-TNG cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations and compare with approximate analytic predictions. We show that $\\langle {\\rm RM}^2 \\times {\\rm g} \\rangle$ can be related to a bispectrum involving two copies of the electron-density--weighted magnetic field strength and one of the galaxy overdensity. In Illustris-TNG, the effective field strength is primarily set by the magnetic field amplitudes within the inner regions of galaxy-hosting dark matter halos. It increases towards low redshift, driven by dynamo amplification and magnetized outflows. Our forecasts suggest that $\\langle {\\rm RM}^2 \\times {\\rm g} \\rangle$ is detectable at high significance with current galaxy surveys and future RM catalogs from the SKA, offering a tomographic probe of large-scale magnetic fields across cosmic time.",

        "abstract": "The visibility of Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission at $z>7$ provides crucial insights into the reionization process and the role of galaxies in shaping the ionized intergalactic medium. Using JWST FRESCO data, we investigate the environments of Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) in the GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields by identifying [OIII] emitters and analyzing their large-scale distribution. Using the FRESCO redshifts, we recover eight new LAEs from archival Keck/MOSFIRE observations at $z=7.0-7.7$, including a potential AGN candidate at $z \\sim 7.2$. Complemented by six literature LAEs, our sample consists of 14 LAEs in total, all of which are [OIII] emitters except for one very faint source not detected by FRESCO. We define seven groups of [OIII] emitters centered around the brightest LAEs and find that these bright LAEs do not reside in more overdense environments than the average galaxy population. The overdensity parameters for LAEs and [OIII] emitters without Lyman-$\\alpha$, calculated for sources with $\\mathrm{M_{UV}<-19.5}$ to ensure completeness, are similar, indicating that overdensities alone cannot fully explain Lyman-$\\alpha$ visibility. While LAEs have slightly higher recent star formation (SFR$_{10}$/SFR$_{50} \\approx 1.3\\times$) and [OIII] EW ($\\approx1.5\\times$), they show no significant differences from [OIII] emitters in UV slope ($\\beta$), UV magnitude ($\\mathrm{M_{UV}}$), or stellar mass ($\\log_{\\mathrm{M}_{\\star}}$). Our results suggest that other factors may contribute to the observability of Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission. Future spectroscopic surveys with broader wavelength coverage and more complete sampling will be crucial for refining our understanding of reionization.",

Despite these prospects, its faint nature makes a consensus on its origin or population properties difficult to achieve, both in observations and simulations. In the hope of finding a breakthrough, we utilize the ongoing high-resolution cluster simulation, NewCluster. By classifying billions of particles in and around the cluster with a rigorous tracking procedure, we find that the majority of the ICL originates from satellites, including surviving and disrupted galaxies. Another notable finding is that the preprocessed component follows the density profile of dark matter better than the other components and has distinctive properties: old age, low metallicity, and enhanced $\\alpha$-element abundance. We further investigate the orbital dynamics, and our results demonstrate that the stripped fraction of satellites is primarily determined by the time since infall and the pericenter distance. By linking the demographic, chemical, and orbital properties of ICL stars to their origins, this work proposes a quantitative approach for tracing the assembly history of galaxy clusters from the ICL.",

The observations, centred at 2.1, 5.5, and 9 GHz, cover the central 0.5 deg$^2$ of two Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) fields down to rms sensitivities of 9-17 $\\mu$Jy$/$beam at 2.1 GHz, 28-39 $\\mu$Jy/beam at 5.5 GHz and 38-61 $\\mu$Jy/beam at 9 GHz. This setup allows us to investigate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of faint radio sources and probe the nature of the sub-mJy population. We extract and validate a robust catalogue of 489 sources at 2.1 GHz, 101 of which are also detected at 5.5 GHz. We perform a multi-frequency analysis of the radio number counts and derive the spectral indices of sources in the deep fields. The spectral index distribution of our sources peaks around $\\alpha \\sim -0.7$, consistent with synchrotron emission from the faint radio population. The number counts at 2.1 GHz are consistent with previous deep surveys and theoretical models, and provide a lower limit on the star-forming galaxy population, which is expected to dominate the faint end. The 5.5 GHz data offer new, direct constraints on the sub-mJy radio sky at higher frequencies. By cross-matching with the H-ATLAS catalogue, we identify a sample of sources with far-infrared (FIR) counterparts and explore the far-infrared-radio correlation (FIRRC). The sources with $q_{FIR} \\geq 1.69$ exhibit radio spectral indices typical of star-forming galaxies. Furthermore, we identify a population of radio-only sources with similar indices that may correspond to high-redshift SFGs, lacking counterparts in the FIR survey due to its limited resolution and sensitivity.",

In this study, we use the high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation NewHorizon, which self-consistently evolves BH mass and spin, to statistically examine the relationship between AGN jet orientation and host galaxy structure. Building upon our previous work, we extend the analysis of projected (2-d) alignment angles to facilitate more direct comparisons with recent observational studies. In our methodology, galaxy orientations are estimated using optical position angles derived from synthetic DESI-LS and Euclid images, while BH spin vectors serve as proxies for AGN jet directions. From a carefully selected sample of 100 BH-galaxy systems at low redshift, we generate a catalog of 5,000 mock optical images using a Monte Carlo approach that samples random viewing angles and redshifts. Our results reveal a statistically significant tendency for AGN jets to align with the orientation of their host galaxies, consistent with recent observations combining Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and optical imaging of nearby AGNs. Furthermore, we find a slightly stronger alignment when using kinematic position angles derived from synthetic MaNGA-like stellar velocity fields. These findings underscore the importance of combining morphological, kinematic, and polarimetric information to disentangle the complex interplay between black hole spin evolution, accretion mode, and the galactic environment in shaping the direction of relativistic jets.",

Results: The near-IR continuum reveals two infrared sources, IRS 2 and IRS 7, while the main protostellar core IRAS 18162-2048 remains undetected up to $2.47 \\mathrm{\\mu m}$. IRS 7 shows a peculiar Hydrogen Recombination Line Br$\\gamma$ profile with a narrow emission component superimposed on a broad absorption feature, consistent with a B2/B3 zero-age main-sequence star. Extended H$_2$ emission exhibits a `sawtooth' pattern in the excitation diagram, characteristic of UV radiation in a PDR rather than shock excitation. The radiative transfer model Cloudy reproduces the H$_2$ ro-vibrational populations for $T_\\mathrm{gas}=600$ K and $n_\\mathrm{H}=7.9\\times10^3 \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. VLA X and C bands observations reveal a compact radio source previously reported as a stationary condensation (SC) and coincident with IRS 7. For the first time, we detect IRS 7/SC in mm wavelengths. The spectral index in the 3$-$6 cm and 3.3 mm regime is consistent with optically thin free-free emission. Conclusions: Our near-IR and radio observations reveal that IRS 7/SC is a B2/B3 ZAMS star that has begun to photoionise its environment, giving rise to an extended PDR and a compact \\ion{H}{ii} region. The coexistence of this source with the deeply embedded protostar IRAS 18162-2048 and other bubble-like structures in the field, suggests a multigenerational star-forming environment. Future \\textit{James Webb Space Telescope} observations targeting the H$_2$ pure rotational lines ($3-28 \\mathrm{\\mu m}$) and other HRLs less affected by extinction will be essential to characterise the cooler molecular and ionised gas to fully disclose the formation history of the region.",

The majority of YBs are compact photodissociation regions generated by intermediate- and high-mass young stellar objects that are embedded in star-forming clumps ranging in mass from ten to one million solar masses and luminosity from ten to ten thousand solar luminosities. The MIRION catalog increases the number of candidate intermediate-mass star-forming regions (SFRs) by nearly two orders of magnitude, providing an extensive database with which to explore the transition from isolated low-mass to clustered high-mass star formation. The catalog comprises five tables that include mid- and far-infrared photometry; velocities of source-associated molecular clouds; distances to these molecular clouds; physical properties of source-associated star-forming clumps; and source crossmatches with other catalogs. The structure of the catalog enables users to easily sort objects for further study based on distance or environmental properties. Our preliminary analysis extends our earlier findings that indicate a relationship between IR colors and the physical properties and evolutionary stages of SFRs. Photometry will be periodically updated online to incorporate measurements from volunteers participating in a classroom activity known as the People Enabling Research: a Yellowball Survey of the Colors Of Protostellar Environments (PERYSCOPE) Project. These updates will continue to refine the IR flux measurements and reduce photometric errors.

The unprecedented combination of extremely precise wavelength calibration, high spectral resolution and high sensitivity of the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) has finally enabled observations that will further constrain both state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution and theoretical stellar nucleosynthetic yields.

Lyman-alpha emission in the EoR is strongly shaped by resonant absorption from neutral hydrogen in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM), which transforms galactic sources into a low surface-brightness background. In this work, we leverage the state-of-the-art THESAN cosmological simulations to produce high-resolution theoretical predictions for future Lyman-alpha LIM studies, constructing continuous light cones for line-of-sight cosmological integrations. We assess the contributions of recombination, collisional excitation, and unresolved HII regions to the total Lyman-alpha spectral intensity. In addition, we explore the IGM in absorption at different redshifts using damping wing analysis. We produce channel maps exploring spatial fluctuations across redshift bands probe-able by LIM instruments. We find that the slope of the absorption-included Lyman-alpha fluctuation power spectrum at smaller scales (k > 10^(-2) 1/arcsec) steepens toward lower redshift, and that our emission-only Lyman-alpha power spectrum lies above the SPHEREx sensitivity, whereas the absorption-included signal is ~4 orders of magnitude lower--providing a conservative lower limit on inhomogeneity signatures and highlighting the importance of including resonant scattering in our model in the future. We also find that including outflows in a simple toy model boosts power by four orders of magnitude. We identify limitations in our analysis and propose next steps, including incorporating the effects of resonant Lyman-alpha scattering and line interlopers, as well as larger simulation volumes.",

The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry generates global strings that decay predominantly via the emission of massive axions and gravitational waves. In this work, we investigate the decay of cosmic axion strings in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole and estimate the corresponding energy losses and decay timescales of the resulting string loops. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses as small as $10^{-16} M_\\odot$, the total energy radiated by the contracting strings is found to be on the order of $10^{27} \\, \\mathrm{GeV}$, accounting for both axion and gravitational radiation. Our analysis shows that the presence of a central black hole considerably accelerates string loop decay, leading to significantly reduced lifetimes. These results constitute an initial exploration of whether axion radiation from PBH-cosmic string systems could provide a non-negligible contribution to the dark matter content of galactic halos. The study also identifies the decay time as a potentially valuable observational signature.

This study addresses these challenges by analyzing 33 clusters, aged 3 to 21 million years (PARSEC isochrones), within the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association, sampling the stellar IMF from the hydrogen burning limit to about 8 M$_\\odot$. By using $\\mathit{Gaia}$, 2MASS, and WISE data, we identified stars with infrared-excess through color-color diagrams and spectral energy distributions, ensuring a consistent selection of disk-bearing sources. Our results indicate a disk lifetime of $5.8 \\pm 0.3$ Myr, about a factor of two longer than most previous estimates, suggesting that planet formation may have more time than previously thought. We also find that an exponential decay model best describes disk dispersal. These findings emphasize the importance of studying disk evolution in a single star-forming region to reduce uncertainties and refine our understanding of planet formation timelines.",

        "abstract": "The challenge presented by computing actions for eccentric orbits in axisymmetric potentials is discussed. In the limit of vanishing angular momentum about the potential's symmetry axis, there is a clean distinction between box and loop orbits. We show that this distinction persists into the regime of non-zero angular momentum. In the case of a Staeckel potential, there is a critical value I_{3crit}(E) of the third integral I_3 below which I_3 does not contribute to the centrifugal barrier. An orbit is of box or loop type according as its value of I_3 is smaller or greater than I_{3crit}. We give algorithms for determining I_{3crit}(E) and the critical action Jzcrit below which orbits in any given potential are boxes. It is hard to compute the actions and especially the frequencies of orbits that have Jz ~ Jzcrit using the Staeckel Fudge. A modification of the Fudge that alleviates the problem is described.",

        "abstract": "We present JWST/NIRCam imaging of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) detected by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Spiderweb protocluster at $z=2.16$. We identify 22 DSFGs detected by both ALMA and JWST, 10 of which are spectroscopically confirmed as protocluster members. This is the first systematic analysis of a statistical DSFG sample in $z\\sim2$ protocluster environments using JWST/NIRCam data. Most of the DSFG members exhibit very red colors and reside in the dusty star-forming region of the rest-frame UVJ diagram, indicating strong dust obscuration. The Gini-M20 diagram suggests that most DSFGs in this protocluster are late-type disks, with a significant fraction displaying clumpy and disturbed rest-frame UV/optical morphologies, but few showing clear merger signatures. The DSFG members exhibit relatively large stellar disks and effective radii with a median stellar mass of log(M/Msun) = 10.8 +/- 0.3, placing them above coeval field DSFGs and typical protocluster galaxies in the size-mass relation at both rest-frame optical and near-infrared wavelengths. These sizes are comparable to those of more evolved field DSFGs at z~1-2, indicating accelerated structural growth in dense environments. Moreover, these DSFG members show a decreasing trend in stellar size from shorter to longer wavelengths, with a moderately steep slope comparable to coeval field DSFGs. These results may support an inside-out growth scenario for protocluster evolution, in which massive galaxies near the center are more evolved and more strongly affected by AGN feedback and environmental effects, e.g., ram-pressure stripping. We propose that the cold gas accretion at the protocluster outskirts drives intense star formation and stellar disk growth in ALMA-detected DSFGs, which are expected to evolve into massive elliptical galaxies at later stages.",

        "abstract": "We investigate binary mergers of galaxy clusters and the resulting radio relics using three-dimensional simulations. The initial setup consists of two idealized, spherical subclusters with a mass ratio below three, each permeated by turbulent magnetic fields, and we follow their mergers with a high-order accurate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code. In parallel, we track the acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) at merger-driven shocks, together with radiative cooling and Fermi-II (turbulent) acceleration in the postshock region, employing a high-order Fokker-Planck solver. Synchrotron emission is computed from the simulated CRe distribution and magnetic fields. In this paper, we detail these numerical approaches and present the first results obtained with them. Two prominent axial shocks emerge along the merger axis; the shock ahead of the heavier subcluster systematically attains a higher Mach number, although it is more compact, than that ahead of the lighter subcluster. Turbulent magnetic fields--both inherited from the initial condition and amplified during the merger--produce patchy, fine-scale structures in the radio surface brightness. Because of the combined effects of turbulent acceleration, spatially nonuniform magnetic fields, and the curved geometry of merger shocks, the volume-integrated radio spectra show deviations from the canonical power-law steepening expected for a planar shock with a uniform field. Reacceleration of preexisting fossil CRe enhances the surface brightness. Our results highlight the coupled roles of merger dynamics, MHD turbulence, and CRe physics in shaping up the observed properties of radio relics in cluster outskirts.",

We aim to investigate scaling relations between observable cluster properties and mass, and to study the radial X-ray profiles of a large sample of optically selected clusters. We analyze a sample of 997 CAMIRA clusters with richness $N > 15$ and redshifts of $0.1 < z < 1.3$. Using bolometric luminosities derived from count rates and a weak-lensing mass calibration, we study the $L-M$ and $N-M$ scaling relations through stacking analysis, while accounting for selection effects and redshift evolution. We also compare clusters with and without X-ray counterparts in the eFEDS catalog in terms of their scaling relations and surface brightness profiles. The best-fit $L-M$ slope ($1.56^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$) is slightly steeper than the self-similar prediction, yet remains consistent with our previous findings. The $N-M$ slope ($0.766^{+0.070}_{-0.060}$) broadly agrees with theoretical expectations and other optical samples. The data do not require any additional redshift evolution beyond the standard self-similar scaling, although current constraints on evolution remain weak. X-ray detected clusters exhibit a steeper $L-M$ slope, higher central surface brightness, and more centrally concentrated X-ray profiles than undetected systems. Our results highlight systematic differences in the X-ray properties between optically and X-ray selected cluster samples. This study extends scaling relation analyses into lower mass and luminosity regimes, demonstrating the value of combining deep X-ray and optical surveys like eROSITA and Subaru HSC.",

We generate populations of synthetic black hole (BH) binaries with masses ranging from the intermediate ($10^3-10^5 M_\\odot$) to the supermassive regime ($>10^5 M_\\odot$), formed from the dynamical processes of merging halos and their residing galaxies, assuming that each galaxy is initially seeded with a single black hole at its centre. The aim is to estimate the rate of these BH mergers which could be detected by LISA and LGWA. Using PINOCCHIO cosmological simulation and a semi-analytical model based on GAEA, we construct a population of merging BHs by implementing a \"light\" seeding scheme and calculating the merging timescales using the Chandrasekhar prescription. We provide upper and lower limits of dynamical friction timescale by varying the mass of the infalling object to create \"pessimistic\" and \"optimistic\" merger rates respectively. We find that for our synthetic population of MBHs, both LGWA and LISA are able to detect more than $15$ binary IMBH mergers per year in the optimistic case, while in the pessimistic case less than $\\sim5$ detections would be possible considering the entire lifetime of the detectors. For SMBHs, the rates are slightly lower in both cases. Most mergers below $z\\approx4$ are detected in the optimistic case, although mergers beyond $z=8$ are also detectable at a lower rate. We find that LGWA is better suited for high-SNR IMBH detections at higher redshift, while LISA is more sensitive to massive SMBHs.

In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of attention-based architectures, including variants of vision transformers (ViTs) and shifted window (Swin) transformers, in constraining the cosmological parameters $\\Omega_m$ and $S_8$ from weak lensing mass maps. Using a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework, we compare transformer-based methods to CNNs. We also examine performance scaling with the number of available $N$-body simulations, highlighting the importance of pre-training for transformer architectures. We find that the Swin transformer performs significantly better than vanilla ViTs, especially with limited training data. Despite their higher representational capacity, the Figure of Merit for cosmology achieved by transformers is comparable to that of CNNs under realistic noise conditions.",

        "abstract": "Topological analysis of galaxy distributions has gathered increasing attention in cosmology, as they are able to capture non-Gaussian features of large-scale structures (LSS) that are overlooked by conventional two-point clustering statistics. We utilize Betti curves, a summary statistic derived from persistent homology, to characterize the multiscale topological features of the LSS, including connected components, loops, and voids, as a complementary cosmological probe. Using halo catalogs from the \\textsc{Quijote} suite, we construct Betti curves, assess their sensitivity to cosmological parameters, and train automated machine learning based emulators to model their dependence on cosmological parameters. Our Bayesian inference recovers unbiased estimation of cosmological parameters, notably $n_{\\mathrm{s}}$, $\\sigma_8$, and $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{m}}$, while validation on sub-box simulations confirms robustness against cosmic variance. We further investigate the impact of redshift-space distortions (RSD) on Betti curves and demonstrate that including RSD enhances sensitivity to growth-related parameters. By jointly analyzing Betti curves and the power spectrum, we achieve significantly tightened constraints than using power spectrum alone on parameters such as $n_{\\mathrm{s}}$, $\\sigma_8$, and $w$. These findings highlight Betti curves -- especially when combined with traditional two-point statistics -- as a promising, interpretable tool for future galaxy survey analyses.",

        "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic transients, observationally classified as repeaters or nonrepeaters. This classification may be biased, as some apparently non-repeating sources could simply have undetected subsequent bursts. To address this, we develop a semi-supervised learning framework to identify distinguishing features of repeaters using primary observational parameters from the Blinkverse database, which draws from the CHIME/FRB Catalogs. The framework combines labeled data (known repeaters and confidently classified non-repeaters) with unlabeled sources previously flagged as non-repeaters but exhibiting repeater-like characteristics. We employ uniform manifold approximation and projection with a nearest-neighbor scheme to select potential candidates, followed by semi-supervised classification using five base estimators, including random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, AdaBoost, and Gradient boost. Each model is fine-tuned through cross-validation, and a voting strategy among the five models is employed to enhance robustness. All models achieve consistently high performance, identifying dispersion measure, peak frequency, and fluence as the most discriminative features. Repeaters tend to show lower dispersion measures, higher peak frequencies, and higher fluences than non-repeaters. We also identify a set of candidate repeaters, several of which are consistent with prior independent studies. Our approach can identify 36 additional repeater candidates that conventional methods may have missed. Finally, the results highlight dispersion measure as a key discriminator between repeaters and non-repeaters, revealing a tension between physical and instrumental origins-either environmental effects, if the two populations arise from distinct progenitors, or detection bias, as nearby sources are more easily observed.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the imprints of memory-burdened primordial black holes (PBH) on the global 21 cm signal during the cosmic dawn. Recent studies reopened the possibility of a mass window of PBHs as a compelling candidate for dark matter, particularly in low-mass regimes ($M_{\\text {PBH}}< 10^{15}$ g) where conventional constraints from evaporation are being revisited in light of quantum gravitational effects. One such effect, the \\textit{memory burden effect}, slows down black hole evaporation by incorporating the backreaction of radiation on the black hole microstates, substantially extending the lifetime of light PBHs and thus modifying their late-time emission spectra. This prolonged emission can dramatically alter the energy injection history in the early universe. By computing the modified energy injection rates into the intergalactic medium and incorporating them into the thermal and ionization evolution of neutral hydrogen, we obtain projected constraints on the fraction of dark matter. The bounds are obtained from the fact that these low mass PBHs, which were thought otherwise evaporated, can modify the absorption amplitude in the global 21 cm signal at redshift $z\\approx17$. Considering the two viable scenarios of transition to the memory-burden phase: fast (or instantaneous) and slow (transition with a finite width), we show how the 21 cm bounds are sensitive to different mass ranges. For a broad transition with $\\delta=10^{-2}$ we find that PBHs in the mass range $M_{\\rm PBH}\\simeq10^{8}$-$10^{13}$ g are excluded at the level of $f_{\\rm PBH}\\gtrsim10^{-8}$. In contrast, for a fast-transition case ($k=1$), the evaporation is suppressed so efficiently that no meaningful 21 cm constraint remains for $M_{\\rm PBH}\\gtrsim10^{7}$ g.",

In this paper, we describe how we have combined a method for modelling the coagulation of a population of dust grains with the MULTIGRAIN algorithm for modelling the dynamical evolution of a population of dust grains that are subject to strong gas drag. We solve the dynamical evolution of the dust grains due to gas drag using a recently-developed implicit integration method, and we introduce a new implicit method to model the diffusion of the dust due to unresolved hydrodynamic turbulence. The resulting smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code allows us, for the first time, to model the growth, mixing and migration of dust grain populations during the early stages of star formation and the formation, growth and evolution of a young protoplanetary disc using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. In doing so, we find that including turbulent dust diffusion within the disc provides a substantial enhancement of the rate of dust grain growth due to the fact that the turbulent diffusion provides a source of small and intermediate dust grains to the regions in which the largest dust grains are growing.",

This proximity allows us to resolve the kinematic impact of feedback on scales down to 5 kpc. Our spectral analysis reveals a high velocity dispersion of $\\sigma_v$=262 (+45 / -38) km/s near the AGN, which steeply declines to ~60 km/s between 5 and 25 kpc in the northwest direction. The observed line-of-sight bulk velocity in all regions is broadly consistent with the central galaxy, M87, with a mild trend toward blueshifted motions at larger radii. Systematic uncertainties have been carefully assessed and do not affect the measurements. The central velocities, if attributed entirely to isotropic turbulence, correspond to a transonic ICM at sub-6 kpc scales with three-dimensional Mach number 0.69 (+0.14 / -0.11) and a non-thermal pressure fraction of 21 (+7 / -5)%. Simple models of weak shocks and sound waves and calculations assuming isotropic turbulence both support the hypothesis that the velocity field reflects a mix of shock-driven expansion and turbulence. Compared to other clusters observed by XRISM to date, M87's central region stands out as the most kinematically disturbed, exhibiting both the highest velocity dispersion and the largest 3D Mach number, concentrated at the smallest physical scales.",

We produce statistical + systematic covariance matrices, and perform cosmology fitting with a prior using Cosmic Microwave Background constraints. We fit and present results for the wCDM dark energy model, and the more general Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) w0wa model.

        "abstract": "We present a comprehensive optical and near-infrared spectroscopic study of SN 2024afav - a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) that peaks at $\\approx$ -20.7 mag and exhibits an unusual multi-bumped light curve. Our spectroscopic observations, spanning phases of -14 to +160 d, reveal several unusual features: (i) a narrow (1,800 km s$^{-1}$) and blueshifted (11,000 km s$^{-1}$) absorption from H$\\alpha$ starting at +20 d; (ii) persistent optical and NIR He I lines at all available phases, showing double absorption structure in NIR spectra at +23 d, with a high velocity component at a similar velocity to H$\\alpha$; (iii) early appearance of nebular [O III] emission starting at $\\approx$ +50 d; and (iv) strong [O II] + [Ca II] 7300 {\\AA} emission complex starting at $\\approx$ +110 d. These unusual features, and their onset at the time of the light curve bumps, provide compelling evidence of circumstellar interaction between the SN ejecta and a nearby hydrogen-rich shell, as well as the presence of helium in both the outer layers of the progenitor star and in the circumstellar medium. A comparison of SN 2024afav to other SLSNe-I showing bumpy light curves and similar spectral properties (PTF10hgi, SN 2017egm, SN 2019hge), points to a rare sub-group of SLSNe-I in which CSM interaction provides an important modulation to the energy input.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the interaction between scalar field dark matter and stepped dark radiation as an extension of the WZDR model. The supersymmetry-based WZDR framework has demonstrated considerable potential in alleviating the Hubble tension. Previous investigations have examined the interaction between stepped dark radiation and cold dark matter, with the aim of simultaneously addressing both the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions. Given the suppressive effect of scalar field dark matter on small-scale structure growth, we replace cold dark matter with scalar field dark matter in the present work and introduce its interaction with stepped dark radiation via pure momentum coupling, thereby formulating a novel coupling model. We impose constraints on the model parameters using a variety of cosmological datasets, including the Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae, $H_0$ measurements from SH0ES, $S_8$ data from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3, and data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Our analysis reveals that the performance of the new model is nearly identical to that of the original WZDR model, with only a marginal improvement. When using the full data combination, the best-fit values for $H_0$ in the coupled model and WZDR model are 70.89 km/s/Mpc and 70.68 km/s/Mpc, respectively. For the $S_8$ parameter, the new model results in a decrease from 0.8136 in the original model to 0.8113. Furthermore, the coupling signal remains weak, with the constraint on the coupling parameter being $\\log_{10}(\\xi)<4.56$. While the coupling model offers some improvement, it does not fully resolve the cosmological tensions, indicating that further investigation is required to address these issues.",

        "abstract": "EP241217a is an X-ray transient detected by the Einstein Probe (EP) lasting for about 100 seconds and without accompanying $\\gamma$-ray detection. The optical spectroscopy reveals the redshift of EP241217a is 4.59. By combining the $\\gamma$-ray upper limit provided by GECAM-C, there is a considerable possibility that EP241217a is a typical Type II gamma-ray burst (GRB), but it is fainter than the detection threshold of any available $\\gamma$-ray monitors (i.e., $E_{\\gamma,{\\rm iso}}\\lesssim10^{53}$ erg). The X-ray light curve exhibits a plateau lasting for $\\sim5\\times10^4$ seconds. However, the joint analysis with optical data suggests the presence of an achromatic bump peaking at $\\sim3\\times10^4$ s after the trigger, indicating the actual duration of the X-ray plateau may be significantly shorter than it appears. To interpret the achromatic bump, we adopt the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in a wind-like medium and encountering a rapid density enhancement of the circumburst medium, which is likely induced by the the interaction of the progenitor's stellar wind and the interstellar medium. However, this model cannot fully explain observed data, and some issues do exist, e.g., the observed spectrum is harder than the model prediction. Consequently, we conclude that the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in the wind-like medium cannot explain all observed features of EP241217a. In addition, some alternative models commonly invoked to explain X-ray plateaus are discussed, but there are more or less issues when they are applied to EP241217a. Therefore, further theoretical modeling is encouraged to explore the origin of EP241217a.",

In the present study, we consider the case of dark matter described by a massive vector field, also referred to as the Proca field. The density profile in the vicinity of the black hole is explicitly constructed for a broad range of dark matter mass, $\\mu\\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-15}{\\mathrm eV}$, which allows it to exhibit both particle and wave-like characteristics. While in the particle regime, the computation of the DM density distribution is analytically tractable, we find it convenient to compute the same numerically in the wave regime. Nevertheless, in the outer region, the surrounding dark matter is assumed to follow a broken power-law distribution, represented by a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a central spike. For the purpose of investigating the detectability of the vector dark matter in the gravitational wave spectrum, we have modelled a stellar-mass black hole ($1M_{\\odot}$) inspiralling into a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $10^4M_{\\odot}$ within such a vector dark matter environment. With this setup, we analyzed the dephasing in the gravitational wave strain induced by vector dark matter and performed a Fisher forecast for upcoming LISA observations, with particular emphasis on the distinctive features in both the particle and wave regimes of the dark matter.

Taken together, the most likely explanation is multiple major eruptions, similar to those of Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs), but occurring shortly before explosion. This challenges standard stellar evolution theory by requiring either that LBVs explode terminally, or that other evolutionary phases produce eruptive episodes. In spite of very high pre-SN mass loss, the resulting SN is of Type~II, rather than Type IIn, highlighting diverse and previously unrecognized late-stage mass-loss processes.",

        "abstract": "Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally believed to occur in environments where the surrounding medium is either a uniform interstellar medium (ISM) or, in some cases, a dense stellar wind from a massive progenitor. Recently, GRB 191019A has been proposed to originate within the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), suggesting that some GRBs may occur in extremely dense environments, although this interpretation remains under debate. This scenario has drawn considerable attention, as AGN disks are promising sites that can host progenitors of both long and short GRBs, and whose dense, gas-rich environment could significantly influence jet propagation and afterglow emission. Yet, our theoretical understanding of the resulting afterglow signatures in such environments is limited, and further systematic exploration is required. In this study, we investigate how multi-wavelength afterglow light curves can be utilized as diagnostic tools to probe the nature of the circumburst environment. Our results show that in dense environments, GRB afterglows exhibit distinct frequency-dependent behaviors. For jets with large opening angles, the X-ray light curve displays a shallow decay or bump due to a transition from synchrotron to SSC dominance, while the optical and high-energy (GeV) light curves follow typical power-law decays. On the other hand, for small opening angles, the light curves exhibit wavelength-dependent jet breaks: the GeV and optical bands break simultaneously, while the X-ray break is delayed as the SSC component gradually compensates for the fading synchrotron component. These signatures provide potential diagnostics of GRBs occurring in dense media such as AGN disks.",

With recent advances in instrumentation this could be tested if clear differences between wormhole and black hole accretion were identified. We aim to quantitatively determine the extent to which the orbital properties of test particles in the gravity of a spinning wormhole may differ from those of a Kerr black hole. We seek to find an observable related to disk accretion that would be clearly different for Kerr black holes and Kerr-like wormholes. We use the standard Lagrangian approach to derive the orbital properties of test particles from an effective potential. We use standard thin disk theory to infer the disk surface temperature. We find that at a given circumferential radius the physical quantities relating to circular orbits in the equatorial plane are exactly the same for the spinning wormhole and a black hole of the same mass and angular momentum, if only the two space-time metrics differ in the g_rr component alone. However, for a wormhole there are no orbits of radius less than that of its throat. Non-circular orbits, bound or unbound, are affected by the radial distance function; in particular, the angle of apsidal precession in Kerr-like wormholes will differ from that in Kerr black holes. A Kerr-like wormhole is a perfect black hole mimicker in relation to the orbital properties in the equatorial plane. The angular velocity, specific energy, specific angular momentum, and Lense-Thirring precession rate are the same for a Kerr black hole and a Kerr-like wormhole in circular orbits of the same circumference. We find that the area of the (geometrically thin) accretion disk is different, and this yields a visibly suppressed disk temperature for traversable wormholes with a sufficiently wide throat.",

The results show that non-thermal emission can produce pronounced flux outbursts and localized brightening during eruptions, while the associated increase in optical depth can suppress the linear polarization fraction. Introducing pitch-angle anisotropy further reshapes the angular distribution of the intrinsic emissivity and modulates its contribution to various observable signatures.

While CPL serves as a reference parameterization, the Omnipotent and $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM scenarios were originally proposed as possible solutions to the $H_0$ tension and are selected here because they can yield negative dark energy. These models are examined within a multi-probe framework based on the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect and the lensing-ISW bispectrum. By analyzing both two- and three-point Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) correlations, we assess how their late-time dynamics modify the growth and decay of large-scale gravitational potentials compared to the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Despite producing nearly indistinguishable CMB angular spectra at high multipoles, these models yield distinctive signatures in the low-$\\ell$ ISW plateau as well as in higher-order statistics related to ISW, highlighting the power of both large-scale CMB anisotropies and higher-order CMB statistics in testing dark energy physics.

The precisely determined ages of young open clusters make their planets particularly valuable for tracing the early evolution of planetary systems. As the second paper of the UPiC project, this study focuses on stars in stellar groups that host transiting planets or planetary candidates. We categorize these stellar groups into Open Clusters (OCs) and Moving Groups (MGs) based on the Jacobi radius to investigate potential differences in their planetary systems. By cross-matching the latest star cluster catalogs with catalogs of transiting planets and candidates, we have compiled the most extensive catalog to date, containing 106 confirmed planets and 168 candidates within OCs and MGs. We refitted the structural parameters of these stellar groups and identified substructures using the \\texttt{HDBSCAN} and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithms. Our analysis reveals the density evolution of both MGs and OCs during their first Gyr. We find that MGs consistently exhibit a significantly higher planet fraction than OCs, regardless of sample selection, particularly for Hot Jupiters. Furthermore, exoplanet radii show a clear dichotomy at early stages: most sub-Jupiters evolve into Neptune-sized planets within 100 Myr, while super-Jupiters undergo only minimal contraction. These results suggest that young sub-Jupiters (\\textless 100 Myr) represent puffy, Neptune-mass planets undergoing vigorous photoevaporation, whereas Jupiter-mass planets can maintain their atmospheres. We also report evidence for the early emergence of the hot-Neptune desert at 100 Myr in both OCs and MGs.",

        "abstract": "Ongoing and near-future spectroscopic surveys, such as DESI, DESI-II and Spec-S5, rely on imaging-based selections to construct uniform, three-dimensional tracers of large-scale structure. While spectroscopic data from these surveys constrain the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature with high precision, the imaging surveys used for target selection can provide useful information on the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$. In this work we explore the feasibility of angular BAO measurements for the Intermediate-Band Imaging Survey (IBIS) using recent constraints on clustering from a pilot survey spanning $2.2<3.5$. Through Fisher forecasts, we find that a 5000 deg$^2$ survey of LAEs with realistic bias, a tracer density of $2\\times 10^{-4}$ (h/Mpc)$^3$ and interloper fraction $f_{\\rm int}=10\\%$ can constrain the BAO dilation parameter $\\alpha$ at $z_{\\rm eff}=2.8$ with a precision of 2.6\\%, with dependence on the sample properties that is consistent with shot noise-dominated measurements. We then explore medium-band survey specifications for the planned Stage-V Spectroscopic Instrument (Spec-S5) and beyond, demonstrating the potential for precise high-redshift BAO measurements. Our forecasts motivate early measurements of BAO from these imaging surveys, which may inform later spectroscopic analyses.",

        "abstract": "We study the dynamics and clustering of dust particles with inertia in shock-dominated compressible turbulence using the two-dimensional, stochastically forced Burgers equation. At small Stokes numbers, shock trapping leads to extreme density inhomogeneities and nearly singular aggregation, with correlation dimensions approaching zero. With increasing inertia, particles undergo inertial escape and intermittently cross shock fronts, producing a sharp crossover from shock-dominated trapping to quasi-ballistic dynamics. This crossover is accompanied by a pronounced reduction in density fluctuations, a continuous increase of the correlation dimension from zero to the embedding dimension, and a power-law dependence of density fluctuations on the Stokes number over an extended intermediate regime. In this regime, particle distributions show scale-free coarse-grained density statistics arising from repeated trap--escape dynamics. This behaviour is qualitatively distinct from inertial-particle clustering in incompressible turbulence and is directly relevant to dust concentration in shock-rich regions of protoplanetary discs and other compressible astrophysical environments.",

        "abstract": "Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) are highly ionized, mildly relativistic winds seen in the X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and are thought to contribute to AGN feedback and galaxy evolution. We investigate UFO signatures by analyzing a broad collection of published detections. Our final sample comprises 122 robust (> 2$\\sigma$) UFO detections in 57 AGN, spanning wide ranges in redshift, luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington ratio. By combining phenomenological and photoionization modeling of the absorption features, we characterize empirical correlations among UFO properties. We find that line width, equivalent width, and outflow velocity are positively correlated, indicating that the broadest and strongest absorption lines trace the fastest winds, although the $\\upsilon_\\mathrm{out} - \\sigma$ trend is comparatively weak. The large inferred velocity dispersions, often exceeding the uncertainty on the centroid velocity, must be included when estimating wind energetics and scaling relations. From the velocity constraints we derive lower limits on the launching radii, finding a minimum distance consistent with the innermost stable circular orbit of a weakly or non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole. We also assess for the first time how UFO properties depend on AGN class: differences between Seyferts and quasars, bridged by narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, appear to be driven mainly by black hole mass and luminosity. The observed co-variation of velocity, width, and equivalent width supports a picture of clumpy, multi-component winds propagating through a thermally unstable multiphase medium within the chaotic cold accretion (CCA) cycle, and is consistent with both magnetically and line-driven acceleration. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with missions such as XRISM and NewAthena will be crucial to resolve the structure, kinematics, and physical origin of these flows.",

Both systems show kiloparsec-scale soft X-ray emission. In FIRST J120041, the X-ray morphology is clumpy and closely follows the [O III] structures, with surface-brightness peaks co-spatial with the highest [O III] velocities (600-750 km s$^{-1}$) and broadest line widths (FWHM~1700 km s$^{-1}$). In 2MASX J130038, the X-rays are more centrally concentrated and only weakly correlated with the largely rotational [O III] kinematics. Spectral modeling indicates that photoionization dominates the soft X-rays in both quasars. The inferred hot-gas reservoirs are substantial, M$_{\\rm x-ray}$ ~ 4.5x10$^{8}$M$_{\\odot}$ (FIRST J120041) and M$_{\\rm x-ray}$ ~ 1.8x10$^{8}$M$_{\\odot}$ (2MASX J130038), exceeding the outflowing [O III] masses (volume-normalized) by factors of ~4 and ~16, respectively. In 2MASX J130038, we also identify a tentative blueshifted Fe XXVI Ly$\\alpha$ line at E$_{\\rm rest}$ = 7.14 $\\pm$ 0.06 keV (v~7600 km s$^{-1}$), consistent with a nascent hot wind confined to the inner few hundred parsecs. Combining these results with a broader sample of twelve type 2 quasars, we argue that luminous quasars evolve along a continuous feedback sequence regulated by the progressive clearing of circumnuclear gas. As AGN radiation and winds pierce through the surrounding medium, systems transition from heavily enshrouded, compact configurations to phases where the X-ray and [O III] components strongly couple and, eventually, to large-scale, energetically dominant outflows. FIRST J120041 and 2MASX J130038 represent two points along this sequence, tracing the emergence and growth of hot winds as primary drivers of quasar-scale feedback.",

We present a comprehensive computational astrochemical model coupling the gas-phase, gas-surface, and surface (cyclotrimerization) reactions, and the physical evolution of the dust grains (coagulation). The model expands upon the basic chemical network from previous models, enhancing them with updated reactions involving hydrocarbons up to pyrene. We applied this model to simulate the chemical evolution of the envelope of the prototypical AGB star IRC+10216, utilizing physical conditions derived from a hydrodynamical model available in literature. To quantify the impact of surface chemistry, we compared scenarios with and without the cyclotrimerization reaction, further testing the sensitivity of our results by varying the key parameter of hydrocarbon desorption energy. We find that surface-catalyzed cyclotrimerization is a viable pathway for aromatic formation in circumstellar environments, capable of enhancing the total abundance of aromatic species by up to an order of magnitude. Crucially, we show that gas-phase chemistry and dust surface processes are intrinsically linked; their synergistic evolution should be modeled self-consistently to accurately predict chemical abundances. This work underscores that constraining uncertain parameters, particularly desorption energies of hydrocarbons, is essential for future realistic modeling of astrochemical processes in evolved stellar systems.",

This represents the first spatially resolved image of the water snowline using ALMA observations of the main water isotopologue in a protoplanetary disk. The water emission morphology peaking inside the first dust ring is consistent with previous ALMA detections of oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules in the disk, including thermally desorbed methanol. These findings signal that warm cavities of transition disks provide ideal targets to directly reconstruct the spatial distribution of water vapor and the snowline location with ALMA, and directly connect water vapor emission to ice desorption of complex organic species.",

The observed cometary behavior of 3I, including its preponderance of CO$_2$ emission, lack of CO output, small size, and predominance of large icy chunks of material in a flux-dominant coma is reminiscent of the behavior of short period comet 103P/Hartley 2, target of the NASA Deep Impact extended mission in 2010 and a ``hyperactive comet'' near the end of its outgassing lifetime.

        "abstract": "Neutrino self-interaction beyond the Standard Model is well motivated by the nonzero masses of neutrinos, which are the only known particles guaranteed to have new physics. Cosmic messengers, especially neutrinos, play a central role in probing new physics, as they provide experimental conditions far beyond the reach of laboratories and serve as the link between laboratory fundamental-physics discoveries and their roles in the Universe, where many new physics motivations originate. In this work, we propose a novel probe of neutrino self-interactions through ultra-high-energy neutrinos scattering off the cosmic neutrino background when the lightest neutrino species remains relativistic today. This allows us to ``Widen the Resonance'' of such scattering. Meanwhile, we also provide a semi-analytic framework for cosmogenic UHE neutrino production, avoiding computationally intensive simulations and yielding results precise enough for BSM studies. The widened resonance enables future ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes, in particular GRAND, to probe mediator masses from MeV to GeV, reaching couplings down to $g \\sim 10^{-3}$ -- up to two orders of magnitude beyond current bounds. Our results enhance the discovery potential of $\\nu$SI in the high-mass regime, potentially offering crucial insights into the connections between the neutrino sector and dark sector.",

        "abstract": "The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has delivered high-quality atmospheric observations and expanded the known chemical inventory of exoplanetary atmospheres, opening new avenues for atmospheric chemistry modeling to interpret these data. Here, we present XODIAC, a fast, GPU-accelerated, one-dimensional photochemical model with a built-in equilibrium chemistry solver, an updated thermochemical database, and three chemical reaction networks. This framework enables comparative atmospheric chemistry studies, including the newly developed XODIAC-2025 network, a state-of-the-art C-H-O-N-P-S-Metals network, linking 594 species through 7,720 reactions. The other two are existing, publicly available C-H-O-N-S and C-H-O-N-S-Metals networks, from the established photochemical models VULCAN and ARGO, respectively, which are commonly used in the community. The XODIAC model has been rigorously benchmarked on the well-studied hot Jupiter HD 189733 b, with results compared against these two models. Benchmarking shows excellent agreement and demonstrates that, when the same chemical network and initial conditions are used, the numerical scheme for solving atmospheric chemistry does not significantly affect the results. We also revisited the atmospheric chemistry of HD 189733 b and performed a comparative analysis across the three networks. Sulfur chemistry shows the least variation across networks, carbon chemistry shows slightly more, and phosphorus chemistry varies the most, primarily due to the introduction of unique PHO and PN pathways comprising 390 reactions in the XODIAC-2025 network. These findings highlight XODIAC's capability to advance exoplanetary atmospheric chemistry and provide a robust framework for comparative exoplanetology.",

        "abstract": "We discuss how helium sedimentation in galaxy clusters can affect the history of star formation in the central cluster galaxy. As helium sediments, the gas density in the inner regions of the cluster increases and there is also a non-trivial, radially dependent redistribution of the atomic nuclei and electrons. As a result, the cooling rate in the center increases and this can enhance star formation. On the other hand, there is a slow contraction of the intracluster gas, which may induce gravitational heating and therefore has an opposite effect on star formation. In this work we present these effects and aim to estimate their relevance. For this we have performed a 1-dimensional numerical simulation of helium sedimentation and applied it to a simple semi-analytical model of star formation. We find that for clusters with a halo mass $M_{\\rm halo} \\lesssim 10^{14} M_{\\rm sun}$, helium sedimentation effects on the star formation rate are negligible, even under idealized conditions. In the intermediate range, $10^{14} M_{\\rm sun} \\lesssim M_{\\rm halo} \\lesssim 10^{15} M_{\\rm sun}$, the effects are at most mild, below a factor ~ 2 in the isothermal model we consider, even for idealized conditions. For clusters with a halo mass $M_{\\rm halo} \\gtrsim 10^{15} M_{\\rm sun}$, helium sedimentation effects can potentially be very important and renew star formation activity in the central galaxy.",

In this paper, we investigate the possibility of the phantom crossing, and we construct realistic models realizing the crossing in the framework of the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity and ghost-free $f(\\mathcal{G})$ gravity. We also investigate the scenario of the apparent phantom crossing, where dark matter energy density decreases more slowly than usually expected, which might explain the DESI observations. In the scenarios developed, the energy conditions are not violated by any component of the cosmic fluid. In the framework of the apparent phantom crossing, we also propose a new scenario, where the particle corresponding to the scalar field in the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity is dark matter. The mass of the particle might increase due to the coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, which makes the decrease of the dark matter energy density slower. This last scenario may suggest that the inverse phantom crossing might be related to the transition from the decelerating expansion of the Universe to the accelerating expansion.",

First, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the combined data consistently aligns with early-universe measurements across all models, indicating a persistent Hubble tension. Second, we find compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy: early-universe (CMB) constraints favor a phantom phase (with an equation-of-state parameter $w  -1$).

This study combines ground-based observations conducted at a Southern Hemisphere observatory in Argentina with data from the TESS mission. Investigating the orbital period variations of EZ Oct reveals a steadily increasing period consistent with a quadratic trend. We present a new ephemeris and estimate the mass transfer rate as \\dot{M}=1.353*10^{-8} M_{\\odot}/year, indicating ongoing conservative mass transfer from the less massive to the more massive star. Light curve modeling was performed using the PHOEBE Python code in conjunction with the MCMC approach, and the inclusion of a cold starspot was required to achieve an adequate fit. Absolute parameters were estimated using Gaia DR3 parallax and astrophysical equations. Our analysis shows that EZ Oct is a total-eclipse contact binary with a mass ratio of 1.969, a fillout factor of 0.106, and an inclination of 82.13deg. Based on the stellar masses and temperatures of the components, the target system belongs to the W-subtype of contact binaries. The positions of the component stars were displayed on the mass-luminosity and mass-radius diagrams to illustrate their evolutionary status. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between orbital period and stellar luminosity in contact binary stars using a sample of 461 systems with P<0.5 days.

Such methods for determining chaos as Poincar\\'e sections and spectral methods have been compared. The relationship between the Poincar\\'e sections and the spectral characteristics of the orbits has been estimated. The sample includes 45 globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius of 3.5 kpc. To form the 6D-phase space required for integrating the orbits, the most accurate astrometric data to date from the Gaia satellite, as well as new refined average distances, have been used. The following, most realistic, bar parameters have been adopted: mass $10^{10} M_\\odot$, length of the major semi-axis of the bar model in the form of a triaxial ellipsoid is 5 kpc, angle of rotation of the bar axis is $25^o$, rotation velocity is 40 km s$^{-1}$ kpc $^{-1}$. The result of the study is that a 100\\% correlation between the classification by Poincar\\'e sections and the spectral characteristics of the orbits has been established. Consequently, the classification by Poincar\\'e sections can be replaced by a more visual analysis of the amplitude spectra of the orbits.

The number of known multiplanetary systems is expected to skyrocket with the advent of PLATO and the Roman space telescope. The spin-orbit angle is a key context information for the systems' dynamical history, and in recent years a growing number of planets had their spin-orbit angle measured, revealing a large diversity in orbital configurations, from well-aligned to polar, and even retrograde, orbits. Still, observers lack a robust tool to compare the dynamical state of different systems and to select the most suitable ones for future avenues of exploration, such as investigating the evolutionary pathways and their links to the atmospheric composition. Here, we present ExoNAMD, an open source code aimed at evaluating the dynamical state of multiplanetary systems via the Normalized Angular Momentum Deficit (NAMD) metric. The NAMD measures the deficit in angular momentum with respect to circular, co-planar orbits. It is normalized to compare systems with different architectures and provides a lower limit on the past dynamical excitation of the system. We find that using the spin-orbit angle parameter in the NAMD calculation (A-NAMD) improves the dynamical state's description, compared to using only the relative inclinations (R-NAMD). Comparison of A-NAMD and R-NAMD also yields powerful insights into the interplay between eccentricity and spin-orbit angle. ExoNAMD is a timely tool for easy and fast comparison of the myriad of exoplanetary systems to be discovered by PLATO and Roman, and to optimize the target selection and scientific output for future atmospheric characterization using ELTs, JWST, and Ariel.",

Their cosmological evolution is governed by the competition between mass accretion and Hawking evaporation. In this paper we look into the details impact of accretion. Most of the earlier analysis relied on non-relativistic accretion models. In this work, we reinvestigate this in a fully relativistic framework for Kerr PBHs in the radiation-dominated era. We derive relativistic accretion rate and compute spin-dependent efficiency $\\lambda_{\\text{Kerr}}(a_*)$. Using this result, we construct coupled evolution equations for the PBH mass and spin that include both relativistic accretion and spin-dependent evaporation. Our analysis shows that relativistic accretion significantly increases PBH masses and consequently suppresses their spins, causing all PBHs to become effectively Schwarzschild well before evaporation. These effects strengthen the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the initial PBH mass by a factor of $\\sim 4$--$5$, reduce the mass required for survival to the present epoch to $\\sim 2.7\\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{g}$, and shift the viable particle like DM parameter space.

There are existing proposals which can effectively eliminate these two contaminants but issues remain for future high-sensitivity and multifrequency CMB polarization observations, such as spatially-varying spectral energy distribution (SED) of polarized foreground and cosmological $B$-mode signals due to primordial magnetic fields (PMFs). In this work, we investigate inference of PGW $B$-mode signals in the presence of both complexities. We employ a constrained moment internal linear combination (cMILC) method to remove polarization signals arising from spatially varying SEDs. Also, we employ a power-spectrum-based approach to extracting both the Galactic and cosmological $B$-mode components. Two methods have been validated by mock data and different consistency tests have been performed. We apply these two methods to end-to-end simulations for future high-sensitivity and multifrequency polarization observations and investigate the detectability of different $B$-mode signals in the presence of non-Gaussian polarized foregrounds under different scenarios.

Detection of this \"anisotropic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect\" will allow us to independently measure the anisotropy multipoles with $\\ell=1,2,3$, separate the Sachs-Wolf effect from the integrated Sachs-Wolf effect (Rees-Sciama effect) and, to a certain extent, circumvent the 'cosmic variance' problem for low multipoles. We propose a modified Least Response Method for the components separation in the data processing and estimate the required sensitivity of the experiment for such observations. We test our approach on a simulated signal that is contaminated by various foregrounds with poorly defined spectral shapes, along with distortions of the relic blackbody spectrum caused by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and its relativistic corrections.",

        "abstract": "The solar wind is observed to undergo substantial heating as it expands through the heliosphere, with measured temperature profiles exceeding those expected from adiabatic cooling. A plausible source of this heating is reflection-driven turbulence (RDT), in which gradients in the background Alfv\\'en speed partially reflect outward-propagating Alfv\\'en waves, seeding counter-propagating fluctuations that interact and dissipate via turbulence. Previous RDT models assume a radial background magnetic field, but at larger radii the interplanetary field is known to be twisted into the Parker Spiral (PS). Here, we generalize RDT phenomenology to include a PS, using three-dimensional expanding-box magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to test the ideas and compare the resulting turbulence to the radial-background-field case. We argue that the underlying RDT dynamics remain broadly similar with a PS, but the controlling scales change: as the azimuthal field grows it \"cuts across\" perpendicularly stretched, pancake-like eddies, producing outer scales perpendicular to the magnetic field that are much smaller than in the radial-background case. Consequently, the outer-scale nonlinear turnover time increases more slowly with heliocentric distance in PS geometry, weakening the tendency (seen in radial-background models) for the cascade to 'freeze' into quasi-static, magnetically dominated structures. This allows the system to dissipate a larger fraction of the fluctuation energy as heat, also implying that the turbulence remains strongly imbalanced (with high normalized cross-helicity) out to larger heliocentric distances. We complement our heating results with a detailed characterization of the turbulence (e.g., spectra, switchbacks, and compressive fractions) providing a set of concrete predictions for comparison with spacecraft observations.",

These beams of ultra high-energy PeVatron neutrons, by their in-flight beta decay and Inverse Compton scattering, could be the source of the enigmatic, distant and disconnected tens of TeV gamma-ray beams. These ultra-relativistic PeV neutron jets could have been formed during one of the system's rare and intense tidal eruptions, when tens of PeV protons collide CV October 2025 with thermal ultraviolet photons, creating delta resonances. Their decay into secondary neutron beams of tens of PeV is well consistent with observations. Alternative models appear uncompetitive.",

Although most observed compact binary coalescences are expected to circularize before entering the sensitivity band of the ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, dynamical interactions in dense star clusters can lead to a fraction of these binaries with non-negligible eccentricity at the time of detection. To quantify the observability of eccentricity, we simulate a population of merging compact binaries and identify those which have sufficient power in sub-dominant eccentric harmonics to be clearly distinguishable from quasi-circular systems. We consider a binary black hole (BBH) population derived from globular cluster simulations with residual eccentricity distribution obtained from Cluster Monte Carlo (CMC) catalogs as well as a fiducial log-uniform model. Assuming the LIGO-Virgo network of GW detectors with their sensitivities achieved during LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Observing Run (O4), we find that the BBH population with measurable eccentricity will have a significantly higher median eccentricity $e_{\\mathrm{10Hz}}\\sim 0.3$ (with $90\\%$ range: $0.1 - 0.5$) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\\sim 20$ ($90\\%$ range: $13 - 57$) compared to the observable population of BBHs.

We identify 14 AGN exhibiting rapid (on timescales of tens of kiloseconds) X-ray flux variations by factors of two or more that are statistically significant ($p\\le6\\times10^{-4}$), indicative of fast coronal variability. By converting minimum variability timescales to light-crossing times, we place upper limits on the sizes of the variable coronal regions, finding typical scales of $\\lesssim10^{-4}$~pc. The coronal variable region size upper limits of an AGN in our sample are found to be much smaller than the typical coronal sizes inferred from microlensing, suggesting that its corona is composed of localized, transient structures rather than smooth, homogeneous plasmas. Such efficient magnetic energy dissipation in compact volumes is consistent with expectations for magnetically dominated coronae and is supported by recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Future high-throughput X-ray observatories will enable the detection of even faster coronal variability, providing direct constraints on the physical mechanisms driving plasma energization and flux fluctuation near supermassive black holes. Our results suggest that luminous AGN hosting massive black holes are prime targets for probing the small-scale structure and dynamics of AGN coronae.",

We find that the mass-scaled fundamental frequencies of the nuclear (dark) fluid in dark core (halo) configurations exhibit a remarkably tight correlation with the total stellar compactness. This universality persists across the dark matter parameter space explored in this study and is largely insensitive to the choice of nuclear equation of state. In contrast, we also find the breakdown of such universality with the tidal deformability, i.e, the same frequencies show substantial deviations from universality when expressed in terms of the tidal deformability. These contrasting behaviors highlight possible observational imprints of dark matter in neutron star interiors.",

Meanwhile, they show diverse DM and rotation measure (RM) variations, which cannot be explained by current models. A unified model urgently needs to be established. Here we show the first evidence for a supernova remnant surrounding the FRB 20190520B source. We then demonstrate that the five active repeating FRB sources associated with PRSs can be understood within a single model in which central objects are young magnetars in massive binary systems embedded in supernova remnants. This model naturally predicts distinct variations of DM and RM for repeating FRBs. Crucially, young magnetar wind nebulae can generate bright PRSs. As a magnetar becomes older, the luminosity of a PRS will fade, which can naturally explain less-luminous PRSs for some active FRBs.

We report the first X-ray detections of the dusty WC+O binary system WR 112 from Chandra and Swift, alongside 27 years of VLA/ATCA radio monitoring and new diffraction-limited Keck images. Because we view the nearly circular orbit almost edge-on, the colliding-wind zone alternates between heavy Wolf-Rayet wind self-absorption and a near-transparent O-star wind foreground each 20-yr orbit, producing phase-locked radio and X-ray variability. This scenario leads to a prediction that the radio spectral index is flatter from a larger non-thermal contribution around the radio intensity maximum, which is indeed observed. Existing models that assume a single dust-expansion speed fail to reproduce the combined infrared geometry and radio light curve. Instead, we require an accelerating post-shock flow that climbs from near-stationary to ~1350 km/s in about one orbital cycle, naturally matching the infrared spiral from about 5\" down to within 0.1\", while also fitting the phase of the radio brightening. These kinematic constraints supply critical boundary conditions for future hydrodynamic simulations, which can link hot-plasma cooling, non-thermal radio emission, X-ray spectra, and dust formation in a self-consistent framework. WR 112 thus joins WR 140, WR 104, and WR 70-16 (Apep) as a benchmark system for testing colliding-wind physics under an increasingly diverse range of orbital architectures and physical conditions.",

To study trends in frequencies and amplitudes, and possibly spectacular phenomena like resonant amplification, we perform a series of axisymmetric long-duration magnetohydrodynamic CCSN simulations of a 17 $M_\\odot$ progenitor using a finely spaced grid in initial rotation rate from 0.29 rad/s to 3.48 rad/s. We find that these rotating models produce GWs at frequencies of up to 3 kHz, higher than in typical non-rotating models in the literature. The high frequencies arise due to small polar radii of rapidly rotating proto-neutron stars and stabilization by angular momentum gradients at lower latitude. GW frequencies and amplitudes tend to decrease with faster rotation. Different from two complementary simulations without magnetic fields, the magnetohydrodynamic models are characterized by an absence of p-modes above the dominant high-frequency emission band. We find no indication of resonant mode amplification for any rotation rate, although a temporo-spatial and space-frequency analysis reveals some interesting couplings of quadrupolar motions across the proto-neutron star and the gain region. We find that linear mode analysis based on the spherically averaged structure becomes unsuitable in this regime of rapid rotation. More advanced perturbative techniques need to be developed to study the mode structure and mode interaction in the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars.",

Activity-induced changes in the chromatic apparent stellar radius represent a major challenge for atmospheric characterisation. As surface distributions of magnetic features are generally unknown for stars other than the Sun, we adopt the Sun as a benchmark to study how the chromatic effect depends on the distribution of spots and faculae. Using spot and facular masks derived from SDO/HMI magnetograms and intensitygrams, combined with the SATIRE model, we compute the chromatic dependence of the Sun's apparent radius. We test different methods of convolving surface coverage with spectra the identify physical drivers of the effect. We find that simplified approaches, which neglect the CLV, underestimate the apparent radius, particularly for faculae, whose surface coverage dominates at near-solar activity levels. Proper treatment of facular CLV is therefore essential. The activity-induced variation between solar minimum and maximum reaches around 40 ppm for a Jupiter-like transit, exceeding JWST's expected 10 ppm noise floor, while remaining at around 0.4 ppm for an Earth-like transit.",

        "abstract": "Thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) scintillation detectors play an important role in the field of direct dark matter (DM) searches. The DAMA/LIBRA experiment stands out for its reported observation of an annually modulating DM-like signal, which is in direct contrast with other results. To accurately calibrate the energies of nuclear recoil signals with electron recoils, precise measurements of the quenching factor of the NaI(Tl) crystals are essential, as the two processes have different scintillation light yield. In this article, we present results of a systematic study carried out by the COSINUS collaboration and Duke University to measure the quenching factor of sodium (Na) recoils as a function of nuclear recoil energy and for differing Thallium (Tl) dopant concentrations in the bulk crystal. Five ultrapure NaI(Tl) crystals, manufactured by the Shanghai Institute for Ceramics, were irradiated with a quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory, North Carolina, USA. The quenching factor for low nuclear recoil energies of 5-26keV$_{nr}$ was extracted for all 5 crystals. A Tl-dependence could be deduced with a proportional response calibration schema using a $^{241}$Am source. However, this effect was not observed when using a low-energy calibration line from $^{133}$Ba.",

        "abstract": "The Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT (TRAPUM) project discovered eight binary millisecond pulsars in its first shallow \\textit{L}-band survey of unidentified \\textit{Fermi} $\\gamma$-ray sources using the MeerKAT radio telescope. We conducted follow-up observations using ULTRACAM on the New Technology Telescope at the La Silla Observatory to search for the optical counterpart to the pulsar companions. We found two redback companions, in PSRs J1803$-$6707 and J1036$-$4353, and provided upper limits for the other pulsar binaries. We used the \\texttt{Icarus} code to fit the redback's light curves using various irradiation models. The asymmetric double-peak light curves of PSR~J1036$-$4353 are best fit with diffusion and convection models. Comparing the two prescriptions of irradiation and gravity darkening, models with post-irradiation gravity darkening provide superior fits (particularly for lower gravity-darkening exponents), suggesting that the irradiation energy is deposited deep in the stellar photosphere. PSR~J1803$-$6707, on the other hand, displayed variability in the amplitude of its irradiation-dominated light curves over a time scale of a few months. This effect can be modelled only if the companion's filling, irradiation temperature, and convection coefficients are allowed to vary over time. Had the star been closer to filling its Roche lobe, like in the cases of the known transitional millisecond pulsars J1023+0038 and J1227$-$4853, this 4.1 per~cent variation in the volume-averaged filling of the star would have caused it to experience a state change to form an active accretion disc.",

        "abstract": "Recently the ARCA array detector published the down-ward-horizontal event: the KM3-230213A. It appeared as the most energetic neutrino ever observed: about 200 PeV (2 10^17 eV) up to EeV (10^18 eV) energy. This huge value, is puzzling. It is not statistically consistent with several upper bound derived by two greater and longer life detectors: by IceCube and in particular by AUGER array. Asymmetry in recent IceCube neutrino alert tracks upward and downward at same horizontal angles as ARCA one, suggest that they are mostly polluted atmospheric muon bundles. This paucity also disfavor the skimming neutrino interpretation by ARCA. We suggest that the array floating and bending in the deep sea may lead, sometime, to a misleading geometry that is pointing to a wrong arrival angle direction: a much less horizontal muon (neutrino) track respect to a much real one, more inclined and vertical, due to atmospheric muon bundle or charmed single event. Contrary to present argument, if such a rare event would be soon rediscovered in data or re-observed, it would open the road to a new guaranteed Tau neutrino Astronomy. At EeV energy such upward tau air-showers should shine AUGER telescopes or blaze future satellite in Space. A previous model in astrophysics considered energetic neutrino E>>100 EeV, neutrino scattering, onto cosmic, relic, light mass ones. Their ultra-relativistic Z boson resonance formation and its decay in flight would produce hadron UHECR relics around tens-hundred EeV energy. Explaining how sources located at far distances, above the usual GZK hundred Mpc, cut off ones, may shine and cluster in AUGER or TA data.",

        "abstract": "This paper has two aims: the first one is to build a large homogeneous spectrophotometric Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample, using 3069 spectra from the second Zwicky Transient Facility data release (ZTF DR2). Using this sample we reproduce, as the second objective of the paper, the Twins Embedding (TE) spectrophotometric standardisation method, which led to an exceptionally low value of 0.073 mag for the intrinsic scatter. We improve the flux-calibration accuracy of the SEDm SN Ia spectral sample using the ZTF photometric data, which are calibrated at the percent level. We then apply the three steps of the TE parameterisation to a subset of 783 ZTF SN spectra near maximum light, and analyse the resulting standardisation methods. The precision of the phase correction model, which is the first step of the TE, is estimated at 0.01 mag in g band, using ZTF data. Despite the challenge posed by the ZTF spectrum extraction pipeline, we apply a first standardisation in color based on the second step of the TE, the Read Between The Lines (RBTL). When considering the scatter due to the redshift error and the flux calibration error, we estimate a 0.129 mag Hubble residual scatter for this ZTF sample as an upper limit. As expected from the low spectral quality, the final TE standardisation based on three non-linear parameters did not improve the overall dispersion. We release 1897 flux calibrated spectra of 1607 SNe Ia with an estimated photometric accuracy of 0.07 mag. We further demonstrate the ability to apply a spectrophotometric standardisation with limited quality spectra. The RBTL standardisation is more efficient than that of SALT with one less parameter, and the resulting host steps are consistent with zero, making it less prone to astrophysical bias. For future spectroscopic surveys, a better spectral quality would enable the full TE standardisation to be computed. (Abridged)",

        "abstract": "The orientation-based unification model proposes that radio-loud quasars and radio galaxies are the same objects observed at different angles. A key prediction of this model is that the quasars are seen at smaller angles to the line of sight and so should be more affected by projection, and hence apparently physically smaller, than corresponding radio galaxies, but this has not always been found in earlier studies. We argue that the interpretation of observations requires a less simplistic model for the effects of projection, which takes into account radio sources' finite width and their intrinsic axial ratio distribution. Using this cylindrical configuration as a basis for the simulation of radio galaxies and quasars, we simulate the distribution of the linear size ratio of quasars to radio galaxies for different sample sizes and critical angles. Our simulations that predict the ratio of observed lengths in the presence of a distribution of intrinsic physical sizes and axial ratios that we derive from observation. We conclude that to test the unified scheme, samples should be completely optically identified, sizes should be measurable for all targets, and the sample size should be greater than $\\sim 800$ sources. Such large samples with uniform optical identification and accurate size measurements have not been available in previous work, but should become available from wide-area sky surveys in the near future.",

The emitted particles from BHs interact with the thermal background and thermalize, leading to a modification in the Hawking radiation spectrum. By employing the methods of Thermofield Dynamics (TFD), a real time formalism of thermal quantum field theory, we derive the modified occupation numbers of the Hawking spectrum for asymptotically flat spacetimes like the Schwarzschild and the Kerr geometries. These corrections depend on the interplay between the BH temperature and the ambient bath temperature. We apply this formalism in the early universe reheating background scenario arising after inflation and demonstrate that the thermal correction to Hawking spectrum enhances the evaporation rate of primordial black holes (PBHs). As a result, the lifetime of PBH shortens compared to the zero temperature vacuum and leads to interesting cosmological consequences.",

These results highlight the continued promise of other N-containing unsaturated PAHs, such as aromatic imines, as candidates for future laboratory studies and astronomical searches. In this work, we present broadband spectroscopic measurements of 9-iminofluorene and benzophenone imine in the 6-18\\,GHz band. These measurements yield accurate rotational, centrifugal distortion, and $^{14}$N quadrupole coupling constants for both molecules. Using these experimentally-derived constants, we attempted a search for both molecules in the cold molecular cloud TMC-1 using observations from the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Neither of these two ketimines was detected above the current noise level, establishing upper limits for their column densities of $5.1\\times10^{12}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$ for 9-iminofluorene and $1.3\\times10^{13}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$ for benzophenone imine. We also attempted a search for phenylmethanimine (both E/Z isomers) as the simplest aromatic aldimine, but neither was detected in TMC-1. To provide insight into these non-detections, we propose and evaluate different formation pathways using respective potential energy surfaces as determined by high-precision quantum chemical calculations. The result suggests the presence of an entrance barrier to forming the intermediate species, potentially explaining the low abundance.",

        "abstract": "Understaning the filament rising process is crucial for unveiling the triggering mechanisms of the coronal mass ejections and forecasting the space weather. In this paper, we present a detailed study on the filament initial eruption under a fan-spine structure. It was found that the filament underwent two distinct acceleration stages corresponding to a calss M1.0 and M4.6 flare event, respectively. The first acceleration stage commenced with the filament splitting, after which the upper portion was subsequently heated being a hot channel and slow rose at an average speed of 22 km/s. A set of hot reverse C-shaped loops appeared repeatedly during the filament splitting and a hook structure was recognized at this phase, suggesting ongoing growth of the magnetic flux rope (MFR). When it reached a certain altitude, the hot channel appeared to get into a quasi-static phase with its upper edge seriously decelerated and lower edge expanding downward. Approximately 30 minutes later, as a distinct annular ribbon appeared outside the hook structure, the hot channel rose again at a velocity over 50 km/s accompanied with rapid footpoints drifting, and experienced the second acceleration stage with its axial flux increased to 1.1 X 10^{21} Mx. It is deduced that the filament initial eruption under a magnetic dome possess multi kinetic process. We suggest that the magnetic reconnection taken place within and beneath the filament continues to trigger the growth of pre-eruptive MFR and the first acceleration, when the magnetic reconnection above the filament plays a key role in the second acceleration.",

        "abstract": "The Bustling Universe Radio Survey Telescope in Taiwan (BURSTT) is a new-generation wide-angle radio telescope specifically designed to survey Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), energetic millisecond-duration pulses of unknown extragalactic origin. To realize its scientific potential, which includes detecting approximately 50 FRBs per year and sub-arcsecond localization capability, the system is designed to perform real-time beamforming and pulse search over the \\SI{60}{\\degree} $\\times$ \\SI{120}{\\degree} field of view. This paper provides a detailed account of the design, implementation, and performance validation of the BURSTT back-end System. The system employs an efficient multi-stage processing architecture: initial beamforming is executed on the Xilinx ZCU216 RF System-on-Chip (RFSoC) platform; data is then transferred to Intel Xeon servers, where AVX-512 and AMX instruction sets are utilized for the second stage of beamforming and channelization, achieving high computational efficiency to ensure real-time capability. A highly optimized \\texttt{bonsai} de-dispersion algorithm performs a real-time pulse search and triggering across 256 beams, which, upon detection, issues commands to the distributed outrigger system to save voltage data for very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) precise localization. System performance has been validated through beamforming tests using bright radio sources and real-time detection of known pulsars, confirming the high fidelity of the signal processing pipeline.",

        "title": "X-ray Analysis of Gamma-Ray Burst Flares and Underlying Afterglows: Insights into Origin of Flares",
        "abstract": "Gamma-ray burst (GRB) X-ray light curves exhibit a variety of complex temporal structures, such as flares and plateaus. The origin of flares seen in many GRB early afterglows is still uncertain. Here, we analyze a sample of 89 GRBs, 61 of them with flares, both with and without a \"plateau\" phase. We fit the Swift-XRT light curves with synchrotron emission from a forward shock propagating into either a constant-density ISM or a stellar wind, and flares on top of that. We find that the flare light curves are not symmetric, with a decay time that is $\\sim$five times longer than the rise time. We do not find any differences in flare properties between GRBs with and without a \"plateau\" phase. Moreover, additional afterglow properties such as the electron power-law index and the end time of the plateau are consistent between bursts with and without flares. These results strongly indicate that flares originate from a mechanism distinct from that producing the plateau and afterglow. When looking at the prompt emission properties, we do find some tendencies: GRBs with flares tend to be brighter and longer lasting than GRBs without flares. We therefore conclude that, unlike plateaus, flares are unlikely to arise from an external origin and are more plausibly associated with prolonged central engine activity that lasts longer than the main episode that produces the prompt phase. As the plateau cannot have the same origin, this result excludes models of late-time energy injection as the source of the GRB plateau.",

        "abstract": "A nascent magnetar, accompanying a gamma-ray burst (GRB) explosion, releases enormous rotational energy via magnetic dipole radiation. The energy loss rate of the magnetar is determined by the strength of the magnetic field at the pole. We investigated the effect of the magnetic inclination angle on the energy loss rate. The released energy is injected into the GRB jet and shapes the light curves of GRB afterglow. Different evolutionary approaches lead to different curves shapes.A shallow decay phase in GRB X-ray afterglow may result from energy injection from a magnetar with a fixed inclination angle. A two-plateau phase may result from a decreasing inclination angle scenario. In this study, we considered an increasing inclination angle scenario. The energy loss rate of the magnetar increases as the magnetic inclination angle grows. Our analysis reveals that as the lost rotational energy injected into the GRB jet increases, rebrightening phases occur in the GRB afterglows. The rebrightening features are slight and short-lived. The observed afterglow rebrightening of GRB 170822A and GRB 230414B can be well explained within our framework. Some GRB X-ray afterglows that exhibit slight and early rebrightenings may result from an increasing magnetic inclination angle of a nascent magnetar.",

This object exhibited an outburst with a large amplitude of $>7.9$ magnitudes and was observed for over a month. The photometric evolution of the superoutburst was atypical for WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. Periodogram analisys reveals early superhumps with the most probable period of $0.0611\\pm0.0001$ days during the initial decline. After a plateau phase of approximately 11 days, ordinary superhumps (likely stage B) emerged with a period of $0.0616\\pm0.0001$ days, corresponding to a superhump excess of $\\epsilon=0.008$ correspondingly. This delay in the onset of ordinary superhumps is an unusual feature among WZ Sge stars. We evaluated the main parameters of the system: mass ratio $q=M_{RD}/M_{WD}=0.06\\pm0.005$, yielding component masses of $M_{WD}\\sim1.0\\pm0.15M_{\\odot}$ for the white dwarf and $M_{RD}=0.06\\pm0.01M_{\\odot}$ for the donor.

        "abstract": "Owing to hot and inflated envelopes that facilitate atmospheric studies, ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) have attracted much attention. Significant progress has been achieved, from enlarging the sample size to broadening the studies to encompass diverse stellar types and ages. Here, we present a transmission spectroscopy study of HAT-P-70b, an UHJ orbiting a young A-type star, through high-resolution observations with CARMENES at the 3.5m Calar Alto telescope. By using the line-by-line technique, we confirm the previous detections of Ha, Na I, and Ca II, report a new tentative detection of K I, and impose an upper limit on the He triplet absorption. Through cross-correlation analysis, we identify the Ca II and Fe I absorptions, both blue-shifted by approximately 5 km/s, indicating a day-to-night side atmospheric wind. Additionally, we find a new tentative detection of K I. We do not see any significant atmospheric molecular signal in the near-infrared data. Putting HAT-P-70b in the context of UHJs from the literature, it turns out that (1) Ha absorption is more common on gas giants orbiting stars younger than 1 Gyr, with a relative detection probability of $P_{\\rm Age<1\\,Gyr}({\\rm Ha})/P_{\\rm Age\\geq1\\,Gyr}({\\rm Ha})\\sim 3$; (2) any UHJ is likely to exhibit Fe I absorption if it has Ca II.",

        "abstract": "One of the many outcomes of the Solar Orbiter mission is the evidence for the solar atmosphere being filled by highly impulsive bursts, down to about 200 km scale: the limit of the EUV instruments' spatial resolution. Small-scale events of this kind were already known, but their observation was occasional or with limited, lower resolution. Solar Orbiter has revealed that small scale, highly impulsive events are everywhere on the quiet Sun, all the time, at even smaller scales. Their similarity with known larger features, are the witnesses that the physical processes causing them are independent of the spatial scales involved. Their highly dynamic property is the signature of energy transfer and/or local dissipation. Their investigation can thus elucidate on the dominant physical processes acting on the solar atmosphere and on the possible role in the origin of the hot solar corona. In this review, we will present a summary of the observational and simulation results on this topic, led by the results from data taken by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI)/High Resolution Imagers (HRIEUV) instrument. Here, we will cover both statistical properties and analyses of individual events.",

        "abstract": "Spicules are among the most ubiquitous small-scale, jet-like features in the solar chromosphere and are widely believed to play a significant role in transporting mass and energy into the solar corona with their mechanisms not fully understood. We utilize high-resolution H$\\alpha$ images acquired from the 1.6-meter Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) to investigate spatial and the dynamical properties of both spicules and network bright points (NBPs) and, for the first time, incorporated NBP motions in the analyses of spicules. Our main results are as follows: (1) The speed distributions of blueshifted spicules and NBPs both exhibit distinct peaks, whereas that of redshifted spicules is monotonically decreasing. (2) Torsional motions of spicules inferred from alternating signs of Dopplershifts are faster than the NBPs' transversal motions by a factor of $10-10^2$, which may imply the mass density ratio in two different heights as $10^2-10^4$. (3) Blueshifted spicules are found to be more abundant than redshifted spicules in general, but their relative population difference reduces to ~10% at Doppler speeds above 35 km s$^{-1}$. (4) Redshifted spicules lying at higher heights share morphological and dynamical similarity with the blueshifted spicules, which implies the same driving mechanism operating in both directions. (5) These two populations appear above NBPs concentrated under the AIA 193 A bright region. We interpret these results in favor of a scenario that Alfven waves generated by NBPs motions impart their energies to spicules in both torsional and field-aligned motions, and also contribute to the coronal heating and possibly the acceleration of the solar wind.",

Experimental results indicate that the 275 nm UV-LED achieves optimal performance, maintaining the TM potential closer to zero and at the same time accommodates both rapid discharge and continuous discharge strategies.

Using the GLEAM-X Dec = 1.6 degree pointing, which is stationary in azimuth (on the local Meridian) and elevation (near the celestial Equator), the very wide field of view of the MWA maintains custody of a large number of satellites in geostationary and geosynchronous (GEO) orbits in this direction for long periods of time. We use one night of GLEAM-X data in the 72 - 231 MHz frequency range to form stacked images at the predicted coordinates of up to 162 such satellites, in order to search for unintended radio emission. In the majority of cases, we reach 4 sigma upper limits of better than 1 mW Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) in a 30.72 MHz bandwidth (dual polarisation), with the best limits below 10 uW. No convincing evidence for unintended emissions at these detection thresholds was found. This study builds on recent work showing an increasing prevalence of unintended emissions from satellites in LEO. Any such emission from objects in GEO could be a significant contributor to radio frequency interference experienced by the low frequency Square Kilometre Array and warrants monitoring. The current study forms a baseline for comparisons to future monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Dwarf galaxies ($M_{\\star} \\lesssim 10^{9} M_{\\odot}$) are the most numerous galaxies in the Universe and critical probes of dark matter, baryonic feedback, and galaxy formation. Despite significant progress from wide-field imaging surveys, the majority of dwarf candidates beyond the Local Group will lack spectroscopic follow-up, leaving fundamental questions about their internal kinematics, stellar populations, chemical enrichment, and dark matter content unresolved. Existing and planned facilities cannot efficiently provide the necessary spectroscopy for low-surface-brightness dwarfs over wide areas. We advocate for a dedicated large-aperture ($\\geq 20$ m), wide-field, highly multiplexed spectroscopic facility with deployable or monolithic IFUs, capable of high signal-to-noise observations down to $I_{\\rm E} \\gtrsim 22-23$ mag. Such a facility would enable transformative studies of dark matter cores, baryonic feedback, tidal interactions, environmental effects, and stellar populations, extending the spectroscopic exploration of low-mass galaxies to $z \\sim 1.5$, and providing decisive tests of $\\Lambda$CDM and alternative dark matter models. Beyond dwarfs, this capability would impact galaxy evolution, strong and weak lensing studies, and cosmology, ensuring that imaging data from the 2030s and 2040s can be fully exploited.",

        "abstract": "It is plausible that the dark matter particles have non-gravitational interactions among themselves. If such self interactions are large enough, they could leave an imprint on the morphology of galaxies. These effects can be studied with numerical simulations, which serve as the primary tool to predict the non-linear evolution of galactic structure. A standard assumption is that the course-grained phase-space distribution of the macroscopic simulation particles follows the same evolution equation as that of the fundamental dark matter particles. This Letter tests this assumption directly for the case of frequent dark matter scatterings, demonstrating that this is not generically true. Specifically, we develop a first-principles map from a microscopic particle physics description of self-interacting dark matter to a representation of macroscopic simulation particles for theories in the short-mean-free-path regime. Using this procedure, we show the emergence of an effective force between the simulation particles and derive their interaction cross section, which depends on the one from fundamental particle physics. This work provides the first explicit map from particle physics to simulation, which will facilitate exploring the phenomenological implications for galactic dynamics.",

Point-spread function (PSF) photometry is employed to mitigate the effects of stellar crowding and to ensure accurate measurements in this densely populated region. This method, applied to merged observations from UIST and WFCAM in the $J$, $H$, and $K$ bands, extracts $211,179$ stars by cross-matching frame-by-frame across 39 observing nights in three bands. From this, we identify approximately 750 long-period variables (LPVs), predominantly Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, by cross-matching PSF results with aperture photometry, focusing on the UIST field for robust variability confirmation. The PSF approach proves particularly effective for resolving blended sources and detecting faint, dusty variables that might remain undetected. We also examined aperture photometry data to validate our results; however, the PSF-derived measurements provide superior depth and completeness, particularly for obscured stellar populations. The resulting master catalog provides a basis for future analyses of variability amplitudes, periods, and star-formation history (SFH), paving the way for a deeper understanding of mass-loss and the dynamical evolution of the central region of M33.",

Furthermore, star-forming galaxies dominate the low-mass end of the total GSMF, whereas passive galaxies mainly shape the intermediate-to-high-mass regime. (ii) The GSMF of central galaxies dominates the high-mass end, whereas satellites and ungrouped galaxies shape the intermediate-to-low-mass regime. Additionally, we find a relative increase in the abundance of low-mass galaxies moving from dense group environments to isolated systems. (iii) More massive halos host more massive galaxies, have a higher fraction of passive systems, and show a steeper decline in the number of intermediate-mass galaxies. Finally, our results reveal larger differences between passive and star-forming GSMFs than predicted by a phenomenological quenching model, but generally confirm the environmental quenching trends for centrals and satellites reported in other works.",

Meanwhile, stochastic thermal heating is essential for driving a hot, metal-enriched gaseous halo, thereby creating a multiphase circumgalactic medium that is absent in the predecessor code. In the cosmological context, we calibrate the simulation to match the stellar mass growth history targeted by the AGORA collaboration.

While many previous studies have analyzed thermal instability in uniform medium, the instability mechanism in gravitationally stratified medium like CGM has not been fully analyzed. This study investigates how gravity affects the behavior of thermal instability through linear perturbation analyses.We find that in stratified medium, thermal instability can drive over-stable modes, a behavior distinctly different from the monotonic growth of thermal instability in a uniformmedium. Furthermore, we find that the combination of buoyancy and thermal instability drives other two unstable modes. Applying our results to a simplified model of the CGM, we estimate the gas accretion rate from the CGM to the Galactic disk and the typical size of high-velocity cloud driven by thermal instability to be a few solar masses per year. This gas accretion rate is comparable to the observed star formation rate, and hence, the mass in the Galactic disk can be maintained.

        "abstract": "If dark matter is composed of massive bosons, a Bose-Einstein Condensation process must have occurred during the cosmological evolution. Therefore, galactic dark matter may be in a form of a self-gravitating condensate, in the presence of self-interactions. We consider the possibility that the self-interacting potential of the condensate dark matter is of the logarithmic form. In order to describe the condensate dark matter we use the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a logarithmic nonlinearity, and the Thomas-Fermi approximation. With the use of the hydrodynamic representation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we obtain the equation of state of the condensate, which has the form of the ideal gas equation of state, with the pressure proportional to the dark matter density. The basic equation describing the density distribution of the static condensate is derived, and its solution is obtained in the form of a series solution, constructed with the help of the Adomian Decomposition Method. To test the model we consider the properties of the galactic rotation curves in the logarithmic Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter scenario, by using a sample from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) data. The fit of the theoretical predictions of the rotation curves with the observational data indicate that the logarithmic Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter model gives an acceptable description of the SPARC data, and thus it may be considered as a possible candidate for the in depth understanding of the dark matter properties.",

Analyzing central galaxies in TNG100 (N = 18,954), EAGLE (N = 1,522), and CAMELS-TNG (N = 6,664), we find partial correlation coefficients of r = +0.24, +0.34, and +0.66 respectively, all highly significant (p < 10^-10). The correlation is absent in SIMBA (r = +0.01, p = 0.09), which employs a torque-limited black hole accretion model rather than the Bondi-based prescription used by the other simulations. Both TNG and EAGLE exhibit a mass-dependent sign transition: the correlation is negative or null at log(M200/Msun) < 11.5 but strongly positive at higher masses. We interpret this pattern as reflecting the coupling between Bondi accretion rates and central gas density structure: halos with higher concentration have denser cores, enabling more efficient black hole growth at fixed halo mass. The absence of the correlation in torque-limited models supports this interpretation. These results suggest that halo concentration may be a fundamental parameter governing black hole-galaxy coevolution.",

        "abstract": "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV DR17 Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) consists of 2,233,939 high-quality optical galaxy spectra obtained through 2\" fibers, providing a rich spectroscopic resource for studying galaxy evolution across a broad redshift range. eBOSS was designed primarily for large-scale structure and BAO measurements and, as such, focused on galaxy redshifts, leaving much of the information contained in the spectra unexplored. In addition to the trove of spectra, the large number of repeat observations (197,521 duplicate spectra) enables evaluation of the survey's spectrophotometric quality. To unlock this potential, we introduce the eBOSS Data Analysis Pipeline (eBOSS-DAP), adapted from the MaNGA-DAP, which delivers uniform measurements of emission-line fluxes and equivalent widths, stellar and gas kinematics, continuum spectral indices, and stellar population fits. Using the eBOSS-DAP, we successfully analyze 1,899,553 high-quality galaxy spectra below a redshift of $z < 1.12$ to produce an extensive spectroscopic catalog for the eBOSS galaxy sample. We characterize the calibration performance, quantify the reliability of the derived measurements, and release a suite of data products that fully exploit the power of the eBOSS dataset. These catalogs open the door to a new generation of studies in galaxy evolution and cosmology.",

        "abstract": "JWST has discovered an early period of galaxy formation that was more vigorous than expected, which has challenged our understanding of the early Universe. In this work, we present the longest spectroscopic integration ever acquired by JWST/MIRI. This spectrum covers the brightest rest-frame optical nebular emission lines for the luminous galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0 at $z > 14$. Most notably, we detect $[\\mathrm{OIII}] \\lambda\\lambda 4959,5007$ at $\\approx 11 \\sigma$ and $\\mathrm{H}\\alpha$ at $\\approx 4 \\sigma$ with these ultra-deep observations. These lines reveal that JADES-GS-z14-0 has low dust attenuation with a recent star-formation rate of $\\mathrm{SFR} \\approx 10 \\pm 2\\ M_{\\odot} / \\mathrm{yr}$, star-formation rate surface density of $\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SFR}} \\approx 23 \\pm 5\\ M_{\\odot}/\\mathrm{yr}/\\mathrm{kpc}^{2}$, and ionizing photon production efficiency of $\\xi_{\\mathrm{ion}} \\approx 10^{25.3 \\pm 0.1}\\ \\mathrm{Hz/erg}$.

The inferred properties of JADES-GS-z14-0 are similar to those measured for similarly luminous galaxies at $z > 10$ with previous MIRI/Spectroscopy, such as GHZ2/GLASSz12, GN-z11, and MACS0647-JD1. Existing simulations are unable to reproduce the empirical and inferred properties of JADES-GS-z14-0.

        "abstract": "The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), a relationship between rotational velocity and baryonic mass in spiral galaxies, probes the relative content of baryonic and dark matter in galaxies and thus provides a good test of Lambda CDM. Using H-alpha kinematics to model the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, we construct the BTFR for 5743 SDSS MaNGA DR17 galaxies. To extend the BTFR to higher masses using elliptical galaxies, we estimate their total masses from their stellar velocity dispersions using the virial theorem and define the effective rotational velocity as the velocity a rotation-supported galaxy would exhibit given this mass. The baryonic mass of spiral galaxies is composed of stellar, HI, H2, and He mass, while only the stellar mass is used for the baryonic content of ellipticals. We construct and fit the BTFR for a matched subsample of spiral and elliptical MaNGA and IllustrisTNG 100-1 (TNG100) galaxies, finding BTFR slopes between 3.2 and 4.0. We fit a joint BTFR for the 5743 MaNGA spiral and elliptical galaxies and find a BTFR slope of 3.54 (+0.65/-0.48), which is in good agreement with TNG100 galaxies with baryonic masses greater than 10^9 Msun for which we find a BTFR slope of 3.57 (+0.48/-0.37). Within this mass range, the MaNGA galaxies are consistent with both the Lambda CDM simulation and the prediction from MOND; a sample of lower mass galaxies is necessary to differentiate between the two models.",

        "abstract": "Galaxy mergers are expected to have a profound influence on the star formation histories of galaxies. It is generally expected that mergers are the main drivers of galaxy mass growth through the accretion of mass and the triggering of new star formation episodes, while the shocks and torques induced by the merger may drive gas and dust to central supermassive black holes and fuel active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and producing both positive and negative feedback. We test whether a merger-AGN-star formation connection exists by selecting samples of galaxy pairs of stellar masses log(M/Msun) approximately 10.2 and 11.4 within the redshift of 0.25 at various projected separation and velocity differences in an increasing order, and therefore having a decreasing probability of being truly bound and interacting. We identify galaxies in close pairs and then measure their star formation rates (SFRs) (via their NUV - r colours) and the degree of AGN activity (from X-rays, radio emission at 20cm, WISE infrared colours, and emission line ratios) as a function of their projected separation and velocity difference. We find only weak evidence that galaxies in pairs have higher SFRs as galaxies become closer in projected and velocity separation, except possibly for pairs at closest separation of less than 20 kpc and velocity difference less than 500 km/s. Similarly, we see no strong evidence that AGN are more common for galaxies in closer pairs, irrespective of the method used to detect AGN. For this sample, we do not find any clear evidence that mergers and interactions may play a significant role in triggering star formation and AGN activity, opposite to expectations from theoretical models invoking feedback episodes. Secular processes may be more important, although this may depend on the selection of galaxies and indicators for star formation and AGN activity.",

Quiescent galaxies, predominantly found at $\\log(M_*/M_{\\odot}) \\geq 10.5$, exhibit clear mass-dependent inside-out quenching, with central sSFR approximately an order of magnitude lower than outer regions, while lower-mass star-forming galaxies show flat sSFR profiles. Central star formation activity fundamentally anti-correlates with S\\'ersic index, indicating reduced activity in bulge-dominated systems. Spatially resolved UVJ colors reveal heterogeneous internal star formation, distinguishing star-forming regions in quiescent hosts from those in globally star-forming systems. These findings demonstrate that quenching mechanisms were effectively operating by $z \\sim 2$, with the observed inside-out patterns and morphological correlations consistent with AGN-driven feedback processes.

These objects challenge standard models of early galaxy formation and may represent an extreme class of early BH hosts. In this paper, we investigate whether these BHs could have a primordial origin. We first show that the direct formation of these BH masses in the early Universe is excluded by stringent CMB $\\mu$-distortion limits. We then investigate the assembly of massive BHs from lighter, observationally allowed primordial black holes (PBHs) via hierarchical mergers, finding that, although this channel can operate depending on the merger history, it faces challenges in explaining the observations due to the rarity of the required high-redshift dark matter halos. Finally, we estimate gas accretion onto intermediate-mass PBHs, while jointly tracking metallicity evolution, and identify regions of parameter space in which such growth could reproduce the observed properties of LRDs. As a special case, we focus on the strongly lensed source QSO1, whose extremely low metallicity and large mass provide a stringent test of these formation channels.",

Targets were selected using Blanco DECam Bulge Survey (BDBS) photometry and Gaia DR3 astrometry, spanning 7-30 arcmin (~1-5 rt, where rt is the King-model tidal radius) from the cluster center. Orbit-based modeling predicts a strongly time-variable Jacobi radius, with rJ ~ 8-11 arcmin near pericenter and ~18-22 arcmin near apocenter, so stars just outside rt can be unbound and feeding leading and lagging tidal tails. We identify 40 stars with kinematics and abundances consistent with previous, or borderline, cluster membership. The seven highest-quality candidates (S/N > 30) have mean [Fe/H] = -0.83 +/- 0.14 and [alpha/Fe] = +0.38 +/- 0.06 dex, matching the bound population. Interpreting these stars as recently stripped debris implies a present-day mass-loss rate of 1.0-1.6 solar masses per Myr, or 5.6 +/- 1.3% of the current cluster mass per Gyr. These results indicate ongoing tidal stripping of NGC 6569 and quantify its contribution to the bulge field.

        "abstract": "Galaxy clusters represent some of the most extreme environments in the Universe. They are ideal locations to study the impact of an extreme environment on the evolution of the Stellar Mass Function (SMF), which describes the statistical distribution of galaxies as a function of their stellar masses. In this work, we examine how the SMF of galaxies depends on factors such as the surrounding environments, whether they reside in isolated fields or clusters. We use the 9-band photometric galaxy data of the G9 patch from the Kilo Degree Survey (optical) and the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (infrared), containing around 3.7 million galaxies, overlapping with the cluster catalog provided by the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Surveys (eFEDS). After applying appropriate selection criteria, we have 105 eFEDS clusters within the redshift range 0.385-0.8, covering $\\sim 46$ square degrees. The large, continuous overlap of the surveys allows us to examine the SMF of the cluster galaxies within the cluster-centric radial bins up to $5R_{500}$. We find a clear detection of the cluster galaxy SMF up to $2R_{500}$ beyond which it's consistent with the background. We divide the cluster sample into redshift, mass, and X-ray luminosity bins to examine their impact on the SMF. The SMF of cluster galaxies for the high-mass clusters shows a decline at low stellar masses ($M_*\\lesssim 2\\times 10^{10}M_\\odot$) within $0-0.5R_{500}$, as compared to a flat SMF for the low-mass clusters, suggesting the low-mass galaxies grow over time before reaching the cluster center. Additionally, we find a flatter SMF for the low redshift bin within $0.5R_{500}$ at stellar masses $M_*< 10^{10}M_\\odot$. We also examined the effect of cluster ellipticity on the cluster galaxy SMF; however do not find statistically significant differences between the high and the low ellipticity clusters.",

        "abstract": "We present the results of simulations of nucleosynthesis in a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) including the neutrino process. Using the Si layer of $13M_\\odot$ zero-metal progenitor as the initial composition, we calculate the nucleosynthesis by adopting the temperature, density, neutrino flux, and duration of nucleosynthesis as arbitrary parameters and compare the results with the observed abundances ratio of Sc, Ti, and V in very metal-poor (VMP) stars taken from the Stellar Abundances for Galactic Archaeology (SAGA) database. As a result, for the first time, we identify the quantitative requirements on local physical conditions. To reproduce the abundances ratios in the VMP stars, the explosive nucleosynthesis should take place under the neutrino exposure, which is time integration of neutrino flux, of $\\sigma_\\nu\\sim 10^{35}\\,\\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}}$ and temperature of $2.0\\,\\mathrm{GK}\\leq T \\leq 3.2\\,\\mathrm{GK}$. The dependence on the density and each value of the neutrino flux and the duration of nucleosynthesis is weak. We also discuss whether the quantitative requirements are realized during the explosion. Although the requirements are difficult to be realized in the one-dimensional simulations, the non-monotonic thermal evolution shown in recent three-dimensional simulations may satisfy them. Because the evolution is likely caused by turbulent motion stemming from the initial asphericity of the progenitor, it is important to calculate the long-term three-dimensional supernova explosion of multi-dimensional metal-free progenitor models and follow the nucleosynthesis self-consistently.",

The continuum emission has a sharp peak around the SSC candidate but is also widely distributed. We identify two continuum sources at the northern (N79S-1) and northwestern (N79S-2) positions of the SSC continuum peak, associated with CH$_3$OH emission. In addition to CH$_3$OH, we also detect H$_2$CO, H$_2$CS, CS, SO, CO, CN, and CCH at the positions of N79S-1 and N79S-2. The rotation diagram analysis of CH$_3$OH and SO lines yields an average gas temperature of 13 $\\pm$ 0.4 K for N79S-1 and 15 $\\pm$ 0.9 K for N79S-2. Most emission lines exhibit line widths of less than 2.8 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with emissions from cold, dense molecular cloud cores. The abundance of cold CH$_3$OH gas is estimated to be (2.1 $\\pm$ 1.1)$\\times$ 10$^{-9}$ at N79S-1 and (4.5 $\\pm$2.5)$\\times$ 10$^{-10}$ at N79S-2. Despite the lower metallicity in the LMC, the CH$_3$OH abundance at N79S-1 is comparable to that of similar cold sources in our Galaxy. However, the formation of organic molecules is inhibited throughout the N79 regions, as can be seen in the non-detection of CH$_3$OH in most of the regions. The two positions N79S-1 and N79S-2 would be exceptional positions, where CH$_3$OH production is efficient. The possible origins of cold CH$_3$OH gas in these dense cores are discussed, along with a possible explanation for the non-detection of CH$_3$OH in the SSC candidate.",

In order to fully capture time non-locality up to sixth order, we must take into account that every field can contribute non-locally from a separate time in the past. Starting from the general non-local-in-time expression for the galaxy overdensity, we explicitly compute the complete sixth-order basis of bias operators at leading order in spatial derivatives, finding 57 independent biases, compared to 46 in the corresponding local-in-time expansion. As previously found at fifth order, this difference implies that higher-order clustering statistics can distinguish between local- and non-local-in-time galaxy formation, and thus are sensitive, at a single redshift, to the formation time of galaxies. Along the way, we obtain recursion relations for the perturbative kernels and show that they satisfy specific multi-leg soft limits when the sum of a subset of the external momenta goes to zero.",

A large DM-nucleon cross section would fragment heavy nuclei into lighter elements and prevent them from attaining the energies observed at Earth.

A strong signal with a period of 70-100 minutes was detected in wavelet analyses of the two-minute cadence light curve from Sector 20. This signal was detected also in observations from Sectors 47 and 60. The QPP persisted for weeks in sector 20 and spanned nearly three years of TESS coverage. There was no significant damping between major flares. This behavior contrasts with that of previously reported stellar QPPs, which are confined to individual flares and decay on timescales of minutes to hours. The oscillation amplitude is at the milli-magnitude level. A pulsation origin is discarded since theoretical instability strips for 100-minute pulsations are restricted to pre-main sequence stars, while GJ 3512 is an intermediate age (2-8 Gyr) main-sequence dwarf. The persistence across independent TESS sectors discards an instrumental artifact origin and points to a likely coronal origin instead, such as oscillatory reconnection or thermal non-equilibrium cycles in large active regions. This represents the first detection of a likely sustained QPP with these characteristics in a late-type star, highlighting the need for further investigation into physical mechanisms behind such variability.",

The first model, Wess-Zumino dark radiation (WZDR), features a mass threshold in the dark sector that induces a step-like reduction in the dark radiation abundance as the dark temperature evolves. The second model, new atomic dark matter (nuADaM), introduces dark radiation that remains coupled to a subcomponent of dark matter until shortly before matter-radiation equality. Earlier analyses using Planck data demonstrated that these interactions significantly relax constraints on the dark radiation density and allow values of $H_0$ consistent with local distance-ladder determinations. Incorporating ACT DR6, which extends CMB measurements deep into the high-$\\ell$ damping tail, we find that constraints on the additional radiation component tighten substantially in both scenarios, closing most of the parameter space that previously enabled higher values of $H_0$. We further analyze a generalized model including both free-streaming and self-interacting dark radiation, and show that the resulting constraints are consistent with ACT's findings for the limiting cases of purely free-streaming or purely self-interacting radiation. Overall, ACT DR6 significantly restricts interacting dark radiation as a solution to the Hubble tension.",

The region was observed by the JCMT SCUBA-2/POL-2 polarimeter. The filament has a line mass (~80 Msun/pc) larger than the critical (magnetic) line mass (~37 Msun/pc); and hosts one starless, three prestellar, and four protostellar cores, with masses in the range 0.13 to 9.13 Msun. The mean (debiased) polarisation fraction of the filament and core pixels was calculated to be 5.3+/-0.3% and 3.2+/-0.3%, respectively, likely reflecting their distinct physical conditions. The polarisation fraction for the cores does not depend on the type of core, and was found to decrease with increasing column density, varying from 6-11% at the filament edges to 1$^{+0.7}_{-0.1}$% in the denser parts ($N_{H2}\\gtrsim$2x10$^{22}$cm$^{-2}$). Magnetic field orientation of the protostellar cores, in contrast to prestellar cores, appears to be relatively aligned with the magnetic field orientation of the local filament in this region. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi formalism the plane-of-sky magnetic field strength for the protostellar cores (~39-110 microG) was found to be higher than that of the prestellar cores (~22-61 microG); and weakest for the starless core (~6 microG). The average value for the filament was found to be ~31 microG. The magnetic field-volume density relation for the prestellar/starless cores and protostellar cores suggests a transition from weak field case to strong field case as the cores evolve from prestellar to protostellar phase.",

It is however uncertain to what extent the radiation's short-term variability contributes to these effects. We are interested in what this variability might imply for planets around M dwarf stars, and focus on Proxima Centauri (Prox Cen) for three reasons: it is an active M dwarf with high levels of variability; it hosts a likely terrestrial exoplanet within its habitable zone (HZ) that will be a prime target for future direct imaging; its proximity has led to extensive observations. We set out to produce time-resolved XUV spectra of Prox Cen that will serve as input to atmospheric models, and to characterize the intrinsic variability of the star. We analyzed the entire dataset of archival XMM-Newton observations for Prox Cen. To derive the time-resolved X-ray spectra, we implemented a new pile-up correction, a new adaptive time-binning algorithm, and a time-dependent plasma model selection. The estimated EUV spectrum is based on a published template, that we scale with proposed relationships between X-ray and EUV fluxes. We produced spectra of Prox Cen from 1 to 920 Angstrom over ~260 ks of observations with unprecedented time resolution. The instantaneous X-ray flux of Prox Cen varies between about 20 times and one-fifth of the average value over the available baseline, with significant differences between wavelengths. We further quantify how variability affects the estimated average flux when a limited number of snapshots (each typically of 30 ks exposure) are available, as is common in X-ray surveys. Future investigations of the atmospheres of Prox Cen b should fold in the time variability and uncertainties described here.",

        "abstract": "Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) are a new class of extragalactic object, with large rings of faint radio continuum emission typically spanning 100s of kpc; their origins are unknown. Previous optical spectroscopy of the central galaxy in ORC4, a classic isolated ORC, revealed spatially-extended ionized gas with strong [OII] emission and line ratios consistent with LINER emission. We present new Keck/KCWI+KCRM integral field spectroscopy covering multiple strong optical emission lines to measure the extent, morphology, and spatially-resolved kinematics and line ratios of the ionized and neutral gas in the ORC4 central galaxy. We find that [OII] is the strongest optical emission line in this massive, old galaxy, and the [OII] emission is more spatially extended than other optical lines, including H-alpha. The gas kinematics show strong spatial asymmetries, high velocity gradients (>100 km/s), and high velocity dispersion (~200 km/s). The emission line ratios are most consistent with shock models with shock velocities of ~200-300 km/s and are not fit well by AGN photoionization models. These findings strongly suggest that the gas in the ORC4 central galaxy is the result of shock ionization in and around the central galaxy, likely associated with the event that created the large-scale radio ring of emission that identified this source as an ORC.",

        "abstract": "We study the minimal gravitational portal for a massive spin-2 dark matter candidate $X_{\\mu\\nu}$ produced during perturbative reheating. The dark sector couples to the visible sector only via gravity, and we analyze two unavoidable channels: (i) inflaton condensate annihilation, $\\phi+\\phi \\to X+X$, and (ii) thermal scatterings, ${\\rm SM}+{\\rm SM}\\to X+X$, both mediated by graviton exchange. Working in the Fierz-Pauli framework for a free massive spin-2 field of mass $m_2$, we derive the graviton-mediated amplitudes and perform a full helicity decomposition of the final state. The relic abundance is obtained analytically in terms of $m_2$ and the reheating temperature $T_{\\rm RH}$. In the light mass regime $m_2 \\ll m_\\phi$ (with $m_\\phi$ the inflaton mass during oscillations), production is overwhelmingly dominated by the longitudinal (helicity-0) mode: the $2\\to2$ cross section is parametrically enhanced, scaling as $\\sim (m_\\phi/m_2)^4$, and yields efficient dark matter production despite purely gravitational couplings. Compared to lower-spin cases (spin-$0$, $1/2$, $1$, and $3/2$), massive spin-$2$ production is substantially more efficient for the same reheating history. Over most of the parameter space the inflaton condensate channel dominates the yield, while the thermal contribution is negligible. Avoiding overproduction typically requires either a relatively low $T_{\\rm RH}$ or a spin-$2$ mass near threshold, $m_2 \\lesssim m_\\phi$. This places the spin-$2$ portal on similar footing to other higher spins in reheating scenarios, while emphasizing the central role of the helicity-$0$ mode and the reheating history in setting the dark matter density.",

While gravitational lensing has been proposed as an explanation, current millilensing studies suggest the signal consists of three overlapping images, a configuration that exceeds the predictions of the isolated point-mass lens model. In this work, we investigate a binary lens model embedded within a strong lensing galaxy. This is the simplest model that not only naturally produces the observed number of images but also aligns with the fact that microlensing objects usually reside in galaxies. To overcome the high computational cost of the diffraction integral required for wave optics, we constructed a Transformer-based neural network that accurately generates lensing waveforms within milliseconds per waveform. Using the NRSur7dq4 waveform model, we find primary and secondary lens masses of $714^{+239}_{-309} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and $87^{+139}_{-73} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, respectively. We also find a strong lensing magnification of $5.56^{+2.78}_{-1.98}$ (at 90\\% credible intervals) and a Bayes factor of $\\log_{10}B^\\mathrm{Binary}_\\mathrm{Single}\\simeq1.34$.

To illustrate this method, we examined the structural features of the Virgo galaxy cluster and identified its substructure, comprising groups of galaxies of varying multiplicity. Galaxies in the substructure are somewhat brighter than those in the overall cluster, and each subgroup contains an active galaxy. Subgroups are considered to be the product of primordial ejections of matter from the central generator galaxy. It is shown that the average stellar magnitude of galaxies in subgroups positively correlates with their average velocity. This correlation can be interpreted as evidence of cluster expansion.",

        "abstract": "We discuss how helium sedimentation in galaxy clusters can affect the history of star formation in the central cluster galaxy. As helium sediments, the gas density in the inner regions of the cluster increases and there is also a non-trivial, radially dependent redistribution of the atomic nuclei and electrons. As a result, the cooling rate in the center increases and this can enhance star formation. On the other hand, there is a slow contraction of the intracluster gas, which may induce gravitational heating and therefore has an opposite effect on star formation. In this work we present these effects and aim to estimate their relevance. For this we have performed a 1-dimensional numerical simulation of helium sedimentation and applied it to a simple semi-analytical model of star formation. We find that for clusters with a halo mass $M_{\\rm halo} \\lesssim 10^{14} M_{\\rm sun}$, helium sedimentation effects on the star formation rate are negligible, even under idealized conditions. In the intermediate range, $10^{14} M_{\\rm sun} \\lesssim M_{\\rm halo} \\lesssim 10^{15} M_{\\rm sun}$, the effects are at most mild, below a factor ~ 2 in the isothermal model we consider, even for idealized conditions. For clusters with a halo mass $M_{\\rm halo} \\gtrsim 10^{15} M_{\\rm sun}$, helium sedimentation effects can potentially be very important and renew star formation activity in the central galaxy.",

How the magnetic flux and its emergence rate scale with rotation rate are not well understood, both observationally and theoretically. We aim at constraining the emerging magnetic flux as a function of the rotation rate in solar-type stars by numerical simulations compared to empirical constraints set by direct measurements of stellar magnetic fields. We use our Flux Emergence And Transport (FEAT) model for stars with a range of power-law slopes for the dependence of emerging flux on rotation. Complementing this with a heuristic account of the main flux components, we model the resulting mean unsigned field strength as a function of the rotation rate. We compare the results with the Zeeman-intensification measurements and spectropolarimetric data of solar-type stars. Deviations of the model from observations of G stars correlate strongly with stellar metallicity ($r=0.83$) and effective temperature ($r=-0.76$), with a combined coefficient of 0.90, reflecting the dependence of magnetic activity on these two parameters. Correcting for these effects with multilinear regression, we find that magnetic flux emergence rates must scale steeply with rotation power-law exponent of about 1.9) to reproduce observed field strengths, significantly exceeding the estimates in the literature. We also provide correction factors for metallicity and temperature for measurements of early-G-type stellar magnetic fields. Stellar magnetic flux emergence rates scale steeply with rotation, requiring active-region fields to dominate the total surface flux on rapid rotators, whereas small-scale-dynamo fields dominate for slow rotators like the Sun. Metallicity significantly influences the rotation-magnetism relationship, necessitating sample-dependent corrections for accurate stellar dynamo modelling.",

The physical processes that occur during each of these stages establishes how the Solar System as well as exoplanetary systems were formed, are evolving, and will eventually die.

Near-future advancements in the 2030s will enable the detection, orbital monitoring and atmospheric/mineralogical characterisation of close-in (proto)planets across diverse stages of stellar evolution. To take full advantage of these developments by the 2040s, we should develop the capabilities required to image the varied dusty environments in which planets are entrained over their lifetime. This will enable extensive testing of current theoretical understandings - from the micro-scales of dust assembly to the deeply interlinked macro-scales of planet-host interactions - across diverse settings often too small, distant, and faint to be resolved in the next decade, simultaneously providing valuable constraints on the two-way interplay of dusty host environments and planetary formation/evolution.",

This allows studying their morphological properties, required to understand their origin, at unprecedentedly high resolution (~2.3 kpc), crucial to disentangle the different cosmic ray components that populate the Original TRG. We produced a LOFAR-VLBI map at 1.5\" resolution using the wide-field technique with 56 hours of observations. This was the first time this technique was used for a galaxy cluster, especially for such deep observations. uGMRT and VLA data have been calibrated and imaged to produce spectral index maps and to apply further techniques to extract additional information, such as the radiative ages of the filaments or their equipartition magnetic field. Polarization information was also obtained using VLA through the rotation measure synthesis technique. Thanks to the LOFAR-VLBI wide-field image at 144 MHz, we revealed additional, very steep ($\\alpha > 2$) filaments beyond those attached to the radio galaxy, extending for around 250 kpc and previously known as the Trail. Combining LOFAR-VLBI with uGMRT and VLA, we found integrated spectral values between 1.1-1.7 for the filaments. Spectral analysis revealed also that the Original TRG has a complex structure, showing overlapping features with distinct spectral indices that extend throughout its tail. Polarized emission emerges only from the tail and the brightest part of the filaments, with values up to $22\\%$.

        "abstract": "In the most extended layer of the inner crust of neutron stars, nuclear matter is believed to form a crystal of clusters immersed in a superfluid neutron gas. Here we analyze this phase of matter within fully self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations using Skyrme-type energy density functionals for the mean field and a separable interaction in the pairing channel. The periodicity of the lattice is taken into account using Bloch boundary conditions, in order to describe the interplay between band structure and superfluidity. A relative flow between the clusters and the surrounding neutron gas is introduced in a time-independent way. As a consequence, the complex order parameter develops a phase, and in the rest frame of the superfluid one finds a counterflow between neutrons inside and outside the clusters. The neutron superfluid fraction is computed from the resulting current. Our results indicate that at densities above 0.03 fm$^{-3}$, more than 90% of the neutrons are effectively superfluid, independently of the detailed choice of the interaction, cluster charge, and lattice geometry. This fraction is only slightly lower than the one obtained recently within linear response theory on top of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approximation, and it approaches the hydrodynamic limit for strong pairing. As a consequence, it is likely that the inner crust alone can provide a sufficient superfluid angular momentum reservoir to explain pulsar glitches.",

        "abstract": "Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical pseudoscalar bosons that arise in many extensions of the Standard Model and are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Nearby massive stars in the late stages of stellar evolution provide a promising environment for enhanced ALP production due to their high core temperatures and densities. We search for a combined signal of ALP-induced hard X-ray and soft $\\gamma$-ray emission from 18 nearby pre-supernova stars using the full public 22-year INTEGRAL/SPI dataset, construct individual stellar spectra and link them in a coherent analysis. A maximum-likelihood approach is used to extract fluxes in the 20--2000 keV energy range. Stellar evolution models are employed to obtain the expected spectral shapes of ALP production processes peaking between 50--500 keV, depending on stellar mass and evolutionary stage. We construct a joint likelihood that incorporates uncertainties in stellar parameters to derive combined constraints on the coupling constants $g_{a\\gamma}$ and $g_{ae}$ as a function of the ALP mass $m_a$. The hard X-ray and soft $\\gamma$-ray fluxes of all selected stars are consistent with zero within uncertainties. We provide upper limits on the continuum emission and on the 511 keV and 1809 keV line fluxes. The combined upper limit on $g_{a\\gamma} \\times g_{ae}$ is $(0.008 - 2) x 10^{-24}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) while the ALP-photon coupling is constrained to $g_{a\\gamma} = (0.13 - 1.26) x 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) for $m_a\\leqq10^{-11}$ eV, depending on the time to core collapse and magnetic field assumptions. Conservative limits of $(0.27 - 1.25) x 10^{-24}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) are obtained assuming all but one star are in the early He-burning phase. These results rank among the strongest limits on ALP couplings to date and demonstrate the importance of soft $\\gamma$-ray observations for probing ALPs and massive star evolution.",

        "abstract": "Wide-binary stars, separated by thousands of AU, reside in low-acceleration regimes where Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) predicts deviation from Newtonian gravity. However, Gaia radial velocities (RVs) lack the precision to resolve the small velocity differences expected in these systems, limiting previous MOND analyses to two-dimensional kinematics. In this paper, we introduce a technique to measure differential RVs of wide binary stars using high resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra. We apply this method to measure differential RVs of 100 wide-binaries from the C3PO survey and achieved precisions of $8-15$ m/s per binary pair, a $\\sim 10-100 \\times$ improvement (median $\\sim 24 \\times$) over Gaia DR3. Combining these measurements with Gaia astrometry, we construct a hierarchical Bayesian model to infer the orbital elements of all wide-binary pairs and the global MOND acceleration scale ($a_0$). We test two commonly used interpolating functions in MOND formulation: the simple form ($b=1, \\mu = x/(1+x)$) and the standard form ($b=2, \\mu = x/\\sqrt{1+x^2}$). Our results indicate tension with MOND at the presently accepted $a_0$ value: for $b=1$, the canonical value is excluded at $3.1\\sigma$, while for $b=2$, the exclusion is at $1.9\\sigma$.",

        "abstract": "Accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) powers active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and drives feedback that shapes galaxy evolution. Constraining AGN accretion disk structure is therefore essential for understanding black hole growth and feedback processes. However, direct constraints on disk size remain rare -- particularly from long-term, multi-season spectroscopic reverberation mapping (RM), which is critical for isolating the intrinsic disk response from the broad-line region (BLR). We present results from an intensive multi-wavelength RM campaign of NGC 4151 during its brightest state in nearly two decades. This represents the third high-cadence monitoring over the past decade, capturing accretion states spanning the transitional regime between thin and thick disks, making NGC 4151 the only AGN with continuum RM observations across such a wide range in accretion states. Combining spectroscopy from the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope with coordinated Swift UV/X-ray monitoring, we measure inter-band continuum lags from UV to optical. The wavelength-dependent lags follow a tight $\\tau \\propto \\lambda^{4/3}$ relation, consistent with reprocessing in a thin disk, but exceed theoretical predictions by a factor of 6.6. Our lag spectrum reveals clear excesses near the Balmer and possibly Paschen jumps, confirming diffuse continuum (DC) contamination from the BLR. By comparing the three campaigns, we discover a non-monotonic lag-luminosity trend ($>3\\sigma$), which cannot be explained by DC emission alone. We propose the lags reflect combined disk and BLR contributions, and present the first evidence that the DC component follows an intrinsic Baldwin effect. These results offer new insights into SMBH mass measurements and theoretical models of AGN inner structure.",

        "abstract": "The search for primordial gravitational waves is a central goal of cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. Isolating the characteristic $B$-mode polarization signal sourced by primordial gravitational waves is challenging for several reasons: the amplitude of the signal is inherently small; astrophysical foregrounds produce $B$-mode polarization contaminating the signal; and secondary $B$-mode polarization fluctuations are produced via the conversion of $E$ modes. Current and future low-noise, multi-frequency observations enable sufficient precision to address the first two of these challenges such that secondary $B$ modes will become the bottleneck for improved constraints on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. The dominant source of secondary $B$-mode polarization is gravitational lensing by large scale structure. Various strategies have been developed to estimate the lensing deflection and to reverse its effects the CMB, thus reducing confusion from lensing $B$ modes in the search for primordial gravitational waves. However, a few complications remain. First, there may be additional sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, for example from patchy reionization or from cosmic polarization rotation. Second, the statistics of delensed CMB maps can become complicated and non-Gaussian, especially when advanced lensing reconstruction techniques are applied. We previously demonstrated how a deep learning network, ResUNet-CMB, can provide nearly optimal simultaneous estimates of multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization. In this paper, we show how deep learning can be applied to estimate and remove multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, and we further show how this technique can be used in a likelihood analysis to produce nearly optimal, unbiased estimates of the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves.",

Our analysis is based on numerical simulations of the WRLOF process in massive binaries, building upon recent theoretical work.

Using rapid binary population synthesis, we estimate the population of such systems in the Milky Way, predicting approximately $\\sim$ {1800-3200} currently existing BHBe binaries originating from the WRLOF channel. These systems are characterized by high eccentricities and exceptionally wide orbits, with typical orbital periods exceeding 1000 days and a peak distribution around $\\sim$10000 days.

        "abstract": "The JWST discovery of \"Little Red Dots\" (LRDs) has revealed a population of compact, red sources at $z \\sim 5-10$ that likely host supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Recent observations of the gravitationally lensed LRD R2211-RX1 reveal century-scale photometric variability and a hysteresis loop in the luminosity-temperature plane, strongly suggesting that the optical emission originates from a pulsating, stellar-like photosphere rather than an accretion disk. This supports the \"quasi-star\" hypothesis, where a rapidly growing black hole seed is embedded within a massive, radiation-pressure supported envelope. In this work, we investigate the stability of these envelopes using the stellar evolution code MESA coupled with the non-adiabatic oscillation code GYRE. We identify a theoretical \"Quasi-Star Instability Strip\" with a blue edge at $T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 5000-5200$ K. Models hotter than this threshold are stable, consistent with the non-variable LRD R2211-RX2 ($T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 5000$ K), while cooler models are unstable to radial pulsations driven by the $\\kappa$-mechanism in helium and hydrogen ionization zones. For quasi-star masses in the range $M_\\star \\sim 10^4-10^5 M_\\odot$, we find that the unstable fundamental radial modes ($\\ell =0$, n$_{\\rm p}=1$) have periods in the range $\\sim 20-180$ years. The first overtone ($\\ell =0$, n$_{\\rm p}=2$) is also unstable or marginally stable in some of our models, with typical pulsation timescales $\\sim 10-30$ years. These oscillations match the co-moving frame variability timescale of RX1. We argue that these violent pulsations likely drive enhanced mass loss analogous to super-AGB winds, which could affect the duration of the quasi-star phase and regulate the final mass of the seeded black hole.",

Using over 10,000 quasar pairs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 1 data, with projected comoving separations $r_{\\perp} < 2\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$, we investigate how the proximity zone of foreground quasars at $z\\sim2{\\rm-}3.5$ affects Lyman-alpha absorption in their background quasars. The large DESI sample enables unprecedented precision in measuring this \"transverse proximity\" effect, allowing a detailed investigation of the signal's dependence on the projected separation of quasar pairs and the luminosity of the foreground quasar. We find that enhanced gas clustering near quasars dominates over their ionizing effect, leading to stronger absorption on neighboring sightlines. Under the assumption that quasar ionizing luminosity is isotropic and steady, we infer the IGM overdensity profile in the vicinity of quasars, finding overdensities as high as $\\Delta \\sim 10$ at comoving distance $\\sim 1\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ from the most luminous systems. Surprisingly, however, we find no significant dependence of the proximity profile on the luminosity of the foreground quasar. This lack of luminosity dependence could reflect a cancellation between higher ionizing flux and higher gas overdensity, or it could indicate that quasar emission is highly time variable or anisotropic, so that the observed luminosity does not trace the ionizing flux on nearby sightlines.",

Machine learning (ML) is an emerging tool that is useful in drawing valuable science out of incomprehensibly large datasets, identifying complex trends in data that are otherwise overlooked. Moreover, ML can potentially enhance the quality and quantity of scientific data as it is collected. This paper explores how a new ML method can improve the rate of classification of rare Ic-BL supernovae (SNe). New parameters called magnitude rates were introduced to train ML models to identify SNe Ic-BL in large datasets. The same methodology was applied to a population of SN Ia transients to see if the methodology could be reproducible with another SN class. Three magnitudes, three time differences, two magnitude rates and the second derivative of these rates were calculated using the first three available photometric data points in a single filter. Initial investigations show that the Random Forest algorithm provides a strong foundation for the early classifications SNe Ic-BL and SNe Ia. Testing this model again on an unseen dataset shows that the model can identify upward of 13% of the total true SN Ic-BL population, significantly improving upon current methods. By implementing a dedicated observation campaign using this model, the number of SN Ic-BL classified and the quality of early-time data collected each year will see considerable growth in the near future.",

        "abstract": "Single-field inflationary models which generate primordial black holes through the enhancement of the curvature primordial power at small scales are commonly criticized and frequently dismissed because they require a large amount of fine-tuning in the parameters setting the ultra slow-roll phase. However, the standarly adopted definition of fine-tuning has a clear drawback: the more the primordial black hole abundance is small and cosmologically harmless, the larger the parameter space is fine-tuned. A reliable measure of fine-tuning should deliver a large value when the primordial black hole abundance is fine-tuned and at the same time reduce to something close to unity when it encounters typical sensitivity. Motivated by such arguments, we use the (modified version of) Wilson's naturalness criterion for quantifying the fine-tuning and naturalness and we show that the primordial black hole models are not technically unnatural.",

        "abstract": "The detection of a significant deviation from a zero curvature would have profound consequences for inflationary theories and fundamental physics. Relative to high-redshift Planck's CMB measurements, indicating a $\\sim 2\\sigma$ evidence for a closed universe, low-redshift observations of BAO and SN Ia have the advantages of weak dependence on early universe physics, independently observational systematics, and strong redshift dependence of distances in constraining the cosmic curvature. Using the integrated observations from DESI BAO and SN Ia, we find an unexpected $2\\sigma$ evidence for an open universe, regardless of the SN Ia sample employed. When considering DESI, SN Ia and the acoustic scale $\\theta_\\star$ data, the preference for an open universe exceeds the $3\\sigma$ level, reaching $5\\sigma$ for the case of DESY5 Supernovae data. Therefore, low-redshift observations favor an open universe, and this preference persists even when alternative high-redshift priors are adopted. Our results point to the existence of an additional tension between high- and low-redshift observations, present also in non-flat models beyond the minimal $\\Lambda$CDM scheme, thereby challenging the standard inflationary predictions.",

The binary neutron star merger GW170817 delivered the first such measurement of the Hubble constant, demonstrating that GWs offer a path to precision cosmology with systematics orthogonal to standard cosmological probes. To convert GW distances into cosmological parameters, redshift information is essential. To maximize the scientific potential, the redshift must be obtained from individual galaxies, either by identifying electromagnetic counterparts of GW events (bright sirens) or by statistically associating potential hosts within the GW localization volume (dark sirens). The precision of these redshifts sets the achievable accuracy. Forecasts show that photometric uncertainties degrade cosmological constraints by up to an order of magnitude compared to spectroscopic ones. Wide-field, high-multiplex spectroscopic facilities will therefore be an essential infrastructure for GW cosmology in the 2040s.",

        "title": "Continuous Wide-Field Optical Monitoring for Very Early-Phase Transient Discovery",
        "abstract": "The study of transient phenomena in a multimessenger context is expected to remain a major pillar of astrophysical discovery in the decades ahead. Supernovae, Kilonovae, Black-Hole formation, Novae, GRBs, and tidal disruption events are prime examples, as their earliest phases link electromagnetic radiation to gravitational waves, neutrinos, and high-energy emission. Yet, the physics connecting these messengers unfolds within minutes to hours, while traditional surveys revisit the same region of the sky on the scale of days/weeks, missing when the event begins. Current survey facilities excel at answering what happened and how often, but essentially fail in addressing how it happened and how it couples to gravitational waves, neutrinos, or high-energy emission. Continuous wide-area optical monitoring, as proposed here, removes this limitation. The traditional approach, where a GW or neutrino alert triggers electromagnetic follow-up, is now complemented, and sometimes reversed: early electromagnetic discoveries can prompt searches for weaker gravitational waves or neutrino signals that would otherwise be missed. In the Einstein Telescope era, wide-field optical monitoring will allow us to find the optical counterparts of gravitational-wave events and understand their physics. At the same time, a telescope capable of continuous monitoring provides immediate scientific value for planetary defense, space-debris tracking, stellar variability, exoplanets transit monitoring, accretion-driven activity, and when we step into a new observational territory, the true discoveries are often the ones we did not expect. In this vision, continuous time-domain astronomy does not replace classical surveys: it completes them by supplying the missing temporal dimension. Follow-up observations remain essential, but they now begin at the physical onset of the event rather than after its evolution is underway.",

        "abstract": "We investigate a natural extension of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM framework, the $\\Omega_1\\Omega_2$-$\\Lambda$CDM model, in which the total energy density of the universe is expanded in powers of $1+z$. This parameterization recovers the standard $\\Lambda$CDM scenario and introduces two additional, observationally testable contributions to the dark energy sector, $\\Omega_1(1+z)$ and $\\Omega_2(1+z)^2$, alongside the cosmological constant. Using Planck CMB and DESI BAO data, we find that this framework is suitable for relaxing the Hubble tension. The Planck CMB data alone allow substantial freedom in late-time dynamics, yielding $H_0 = 75.4^{+3.9}_{-2.3}\\;\\mathrm{km\\;s^{-1}\\;Mpc^{-1}}$, fully consistent with distance-ladder measurements from the SH0ES collaboration. When DESI BAO data are included in the analysis, the late-time expansion history becomes more tightly anchored, reducing the $H_0$ discrepancy to $\\sim 2.5\\sigma$ level. This highlights the limited constraining power of currently available low-redshift data measurements, especially in the context of the $\\Omega_1\\Omega_2$-$\\Lambda$CDM model, where dynamical dark energy dominates the background expansion over a relatively large redshift range. The model naturally exhibits a smooth quintessence--phantom transition followed by asymptotic de Sitter behavior of the dark energy equation of state, alters late-time cosmic dynamics, and preserves standard early-universe physics. Overall, our results demonstrate that controlled late-time deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM can improve cosmological concordance.",

Permitting explicit first-order phase transitions allows us to systematically search for twin-star solutions, i.e. the existence of stars degenerate in mass but differing in radius. We find that current observational constraints exclude all but two classes of twin stars. The first is characterized by a first-order transition occurring at a very low density, where the material properties of the system either stay largely intact or move away from the conformal limit. In the second, more interesting class, the discontinuity in the mass-radius curve emerges after a rapid crossover transition at a significantly higher density, with the speed of sound exhibiting two sharp peaks at distinct densities. Since neither class shows clear conformalization upon entering the second branch, the standard twin-star scenario linking the mass-radius discontinuity to deconfinement can be firmly ruled out, while even the remaining solutions -- disfavored by per-mille Bayes factors and in tension with theoretical bounds -- are likely to be excluded in the future.",

        "abstract": "The recently discovered gravitational wave (GW) event, GW231123, is the highest mass binary black hole (BBH) merger detected to date by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The inferred source masses of GW231123 lie in a mass range where stellar-progenitor black holes are rare to exist due to the pair instability supernovae mass gap, and hence alternative scenarios of origin of this inferred heavy mass black hole become important. One of such hypotheses of its origin is gravitational lensing that introduces modulations to the amplitude and phase of GWs and can make the inferred mass higher from the true value. In this work, we search for the lensing signatures from GW231123 and all other events in a model-independent approach using the technique \\texttt{$\\mu$-GLANCE} which carries out tests on its residual strain to look for common features across the detector network through cross-correlation and infers the lensing signal in a Bayesian framework. Our analysis tests yield no strong evidence in support for lensing, though it detects presence of potential residual in the data, which can be a micro-lensing signature with a modulation amplitude less than 0.8 at 95\\% C.I. However, our study finds that current waveform systematics for such heavy mass binary systems are large enough to shadow the detection of lensing from such short-duration GWs such as GW231123, and hence no concluding claim of lensing could be made at this stage. We conclude that if this event is lensed, then in near future, detection of similar lensed events will take place with current detector sensitivity and hence can open a potential discovery space of lensed GW signal with the aid of more accurate waveform models.",

        "abstract": "Blazars are a class of active galactic nuclei, supermassive black holes located at the centres of distant galaxies characterised by strong emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays. Their relativistic jets, closely aligned to the line of sight from Earth, are a rich and complex environment, characterised by the presence of strong magnetic fields over parsec-scale lengths. Owing to their cosmological distance from Earth, these sources serve as ideal targets to probe non-standard gamma-ray propagation. In particular, axion-like particles (ALPs) could be detected through their coupling to photons, which enables ALP-photon conversions in external magnetic fields, leading to distinct signatures in the blazars' gamma-ray spectra. In this work, we explore a novel approach to constrain the ALP parameter space using gamma-ray observations, based on the use of machine-learning classifiers. We apply this technique to simulated observations of two bright blazars -- Mrk 501 and PKS 2155$-$304 -- with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), a next-generation gamma-ray facility well suited to probe such features, thanks to its improved energy resolution and point-source sensitivity with respect to present ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. The obtained $2\\sigma$ exclusion regions on the ALP parameter space are consistent with those found by applying a standard likelihood-ratio test, and suggest that the CTAO sensitivity to ALPs could be extended beyond existing constraints over a wide mass range.",

Although FALs are often calculated from white noise models, many astronomical time series suffer from red noise. Prewhitening is a statistical technique in which a continuum model is subtracted from log power spectrum estimate, after which the observer can proceed with a white-noise treatment. Here we present a prewhitening-based method of calculating frequency-dependent FALs. We fit power laws and autoregressive models of order 1 to each Lomb-Scargle periodogram by minimizing the Whittle approximation to the negative log-likelihood (NLL), then calculate FALs based on the best-fit model power spectrum. Our technique is a novel extension of the Whittle NLL to datasets with uneven time sampling. We demonstrate FAL calculations using observations of $\\alpha$~Cen~B, GJ~581, HD 192310, synthetic data from the radial velocity (RV) Fitting Challenge, and {\\it Kepler} observations of a differential rotator. The {\\it Kepler} data analysis shows that only true rotation signals are detected by red-noise FALs, while white-noise FALs suggest all spurious peaks in the low-frequency range are significant. A high-frequency sinusoid injected into $\\alpha$~Cen~B $\\log R^{\\prime}_{HK}$ observations exceeds the 1\\% red-noise FAL despite having only 8.9\\% of the power of the dominant rotation signal. In a periodogram of HD 192310 RVs, peaks associated with differential rotation and planets are detected against the 5\\% red-noise FAL without iterative model fitting or subtraction.

We show that CAM is determined by the ratio of the azimuthal to radial actions (${J_\\phi}^\\prime / {J_r}^\\prime$) in the analytical Freeman bar model. We then construct a new parameter space defined by CAM versus the root-mean-square radius ($R_{RMS}$), and apply this framework to orbits in several representative rotating bar potentials. In the CAM-$R_{RMS}$ plane, periodic orbits generate well-defined branches separating distinct regions corresponding to different orbital families. Several of these branches enclose isolated areas that can be associated with specific orbital families, such as the the $x_2$ orbital family. We further validate the method using orbits from test-particle simulations, which show a well-ordered and non-overlapping distribution of orbital families in the CAM-$R_{RMS}$ plane. Since CAM is fundamentally linked to intrinsic orbital properties and readily applied to three-dimensional orbits in N-body simulations, our results establish the CAM-$R_{RMS}$ plane as a robust and efficient framework for orbit classification in rotating bars that complements conventional methods.",

        "abstract": "The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data stream will inevitably contain gaps due to maintenance and environmental disturbances, introducing nonstationarities and spectral leakage that compromise standard frequency-domain likelihood evaluations. We present a scalable Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) framework capable of robust parameter estimation directly from gapped time-series data. We employ Flow Matching Posterior Estimation (FMPE) conditioned on a learned summary of the data, optimized through an end-to-end training strategy. To address the computational challenges of long-duration signals, we propose a dual-pathway summarizer architecture: a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operating on the time domain for high precision, and a novel wavelet-based 2D CNN utilizing asymmetric, dilated kernels to achieve scalability for datasets spanning months. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on simulated Galactic Binary-like signals, showing that our joint training approach yields tighter, unbiased posteriors compared to two-stage reconstruction pipelines. Furthermore, we provide the first systematic comparison showing that FMPE offers superior stability and coverage calibration over conventional Normalizing Flows in the presence of severe data artifacts.",

A large subset of these transient noise artifacts, termed as ``glitches'' for short, trigger BBH search templates. Some of them go on to produce detection candidates and require human vetting, supported by data quality tools, to be correctly identified and vetoed. In its current version, CoBiTS takes as inputs single-detector strain timeseries snippets, claimed by other search pipelines to be containing GW candidates, and outputs the significance of each snippet to contain a BBH signal and a glitch. CoBiTS is shown to be particularly effective in discriminating high-mass BBH signals from blips and scattered light glitches, even when a signal is near concurrent or overlapping with a glitch. The performance of CoBiTS gains from employing Conformer, which is a specialized model that combines convolutional layers and Transformer architecture for sequence modeling tasks. Conformer is especially good at leveraging the strengths of both convolutional layers -- for local feature extraction -- and self-attention layers -- for capturing long-range dependencies.",

        "abstract": "In the standard Galactic cosmic-ray (CR) paradigm, protons are accelerated up to ~1 PeV by Galactic sources. While supernova remnants (SNRs) have been traditionally considered as the primary accelerators, recent observations by LHAASO and HAWC have detected very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays exceeding 100 TeV from several microquasars, suggesting that these X-ray binaries can accelerate CRs beyond 1 PeV. We investigate the escape process of CRs from microquasars, focusing on the energy-dependent transport mechanisms. High-energy CRs are likely to have long mean free paths and move ballistically on scales smaller than their mean free path, while lower-energy CRs undergo diffusive propagation. This transition results in a spectral break in the CR distribution around the microquasar. We calculate CR energy spectra within a 10-30 pc radius for various diffusion coefficients and timescales. Our model predicts a spectral break and hardening at E_p ~10-100 TeV when the standard diffusion coefficient for the interstellar space is assumed. However, current VHE gamma-ray observations do not show clear spectral breaks, suggesting that the diffusion coefficient may be significantly reduced near microquasars, possibly due to magnetic field amplification by CR-driven turbulence.",

The study evaluates the ability of each model to reproduce the observed expansion history of the Universe through a joint statistical assessment based on the chi-squared statistics, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), and Bayes factor. While both models yield acceptable fits, $\\Lambda$CDM consistently attains lower information-criterion values and higher likelihood, indicating a superior overall performance. An examination of the redshift evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ shows that $\\Lambda$CDM naturally captures the transition from early-time deceleration to late-time acceleration, where as $R_h=ct$ predicts a strictly linear expansion. We also estimate the age of the Universe within both models, finding that $\\Lambda$CDM prediction agrees with the Planck 2018 result, while the linear expansion in $R_h=ct$ leads to an older cosmic age. Recent JWST observations of unexpectedly mature high-redshift galaxies have reopened the discussion regarding whether the Universe may be older than implied by the standard model; although these results remain under active investigation, they underscore that fully resolving cosmic evolution may require refinements beyond the concordance paradigm.",

        "abstract": "We use weak gravitational lensing measurements from Year 3 Dark Energy Survey data to calibrate the masses of 443 galaxy clusters selected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 5 maps of the cosmic microwave background. We incorporate redshift and SZ measurements for individual clusters into a hierarchical model for the stacked lensing signals and perform Bayesian analyses to constrain the hydrostatic mass bias of the clusters. Our treatment of systematic uncertainties includes a prescription for measuring and accounting for the weak lensing boost factor, consideration of a miscentering effect, as well as marginalization over uncertainties in the source galaxy photometric redshift distributions and shear calibration. The resultant constraints on the normalization of the mass-observable relation have a precision of approximately 7\\%, with the mean WL halo mass of $M_{\\rm 500c} = 5.4 \\times 10^{14} M_{\\odot}$. We measure the bias between the true cluster mass and the mass estimated from the SZ signal based on an X-ray--calibrated scaling relation assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, to be $1-b = 0.75^{+0.04}_{-0.06}$ over the full sample. When splitting the clusters into high ($z$=0.43-0.70) and low ($z$=0.15-0.43) redshift bins, we measure $1-b = 0.58^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ and $0.82^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$, respectively. When introducing additional freedom in redshift and mass to the hydrostatic bias model, we find that $1-b$ decreases with redshift (with the power law of $-2.0^{+0.7}_{-0.4}$, 99.95\\% confidence), consistent with findings from other recent studies, while we do not find any significant trend in mass. We also demonstrate that our result is robust against various systematics. The weak-lensing mass calibration presented in this study will be a useful tool for using the ACT clusters as probes of astrophysics and cosmology.",

        "abstract": "The recent IceCube detection of TeV neutrinos from some nearby Seyfert galaxy (e.g., NGC~1068) suggests that active galactic nuclei (AGN) could make a significant contribution to the diffuse flux of astrophysical neutrinos. The absence of TeV gamma-rays from NGC~1068 indicates neutrino production in compact gamma-ray-opaque region. The vicinity of the supermassive black hole, such as disk-corona, is an ideal region, where the high radiation density leads to efficient neutrino production as well as the gamma-ray attenuation. Disk-corona models predict that the neutrino emission from AGNs correlates with X-ray emission, which traces the coronal activity. In this paper, we assess whether the X-ray AGN population origin for TeV neutrinos can be tested by using the spatial correlation between the neutrino population and X-ray AGN population with future neutrino telescopes. By performing simulations, we find that, the AGN origin of the neutrino background above 100\\,TeV can be tested at a confidence level of $\\sim2.4\\sigma$ with five-year observations of IceCube-Gen2, which has an angular resolution of $\\sim0.2$ degree.

It is commonly accepted that, for low mass transfer rates, an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) is present in the inner region. But the observed relativistically broadened emission lines in the reflection spectra clearly indicate the existence of discs near the innermost stable circular orbit $(R_{\\rm{ISCO}})$. We investigate the interaction between the coronal flow and the disc in neutron star LMXBs, and find that gas condensation from the dominant, coronal accretion flow to an inner disc is enhanced as compared to that in black hole LMXBs as a consequence of irradiation of the corona by the neutron star surface. Computations show that for low mass transfer rates ($\\sim 0.005-0.02$ Eddington rate) a persistent weak disc can coexist with a coronal flow in the innermost region, where a pure ADAF would have been expected. The inner disc extends outwards from $R_{\\rm{ISCO}}$ to $\\sim 10 R_{\\rm{ISCO}}$ for Eddington ratios ($L/L_{\\rm{Edd}}$) as low as $\\sim 0.002$, covers a larger region for higher Eddington ratios, and eventually connects to the outer disc at $L/L_{\\rm{Edd}} \\sim 0.02$, thereby transiting to a soft state. We demonstrate that the observationally inferred region of the broad iron lines in the hard-state sources generally lies within the extension of the inner discs predicted by the condensation model. Disappearance of the broad iron lines is predicted at very low luminosities, either caused by very low accretion rates or disc truncation by strong magnetic fields.",

We also characterize the energy evolution of the fractional relative intensity across both excess and deficit regions.

        "abstract": "We present a search for polarization oscillation of the Crab Nebula, also known as Tau A, at millimeter wavelengths using observations with the Simons Array, the successor experiment to POLARBEAR. We follow up on previous work by POLARBEAR using 90 GHz band data of the 2023 observing season of the Simons Array to evaluate the variability of Tau A's polarization angle. Tau A is widely used as a polarization angle calibration source in millimeter-wave astronomy, and thus it is necessary to validate the stability. Additionally, an interesting application of the time-resolved polarimetry of Tau A is to search for axion-like particles (ALPs). We do not detect a global signal across the frequencies considered in this analysis and place a median 95% upper bound of polarization oscillation amplitude $A<0.12^{\\circ}$ over oscillation frequencies from 3.39 year$^{-1}$ to 1.50 day$^{-1}$. This constrains the ALP-photon coupling at a median 95% upper bound of $g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}< 3.84\\times 10^{-12}\\times\\left(m_a/10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{eV}\\right)$ in the mass range from $4.4\\times10^{-22}$ to $7.2\\times10^{-20}$ eV, assuming the ALP constitutes all of dark matter, its field is a stochastic Gaussian field, and it is the sole source of Tau A's polarization angle oscillation. Additionally, we do not detect signal at the frequencies where 2.5$\\sigma$ hints were previously reported by POLARBEAR, but we do not exclude these signals at the 95% confidence level.",

        "abstract": "Searching for fleeting radio transients like fast radio bursts (FRBs) with wide-field radio telescopes has become a common challenge in data-intensive science. Conventional algorithms normally cost enormous time to seek candidates by finding the correct dispersion measures, of which the process is so-called dedispersion. Here we present a novel scheme to identify FRB signals from raw data without dedispersion using Machine Learning (ML). Under the data environment for multibeam receivers, we train the EfficientNet model and achieve both exceeding 92% accuracy and precision in FRB recognition. We find that the searching efficiency can be significantly enhanced without the procedure of dedispersion compared with conventional softwares like TransientX and presto. Specifically, the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI) for single-beam and multibeam data has been investigated, and we find ML can naturally mitigate RFI under the multibeam environment. Finally, we validate the trained model on actual data from the current FRB surveys carried out by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, which provides considerable potential for real implementation in the future.",

To reach an energy resolution better than \\SI{500}{meV} at the tritium $\\beta$-spectrum endpoint of \\SI{18.6}{keV}, and accounting for all uncertainties in the filtering chain, the electrode voltage must be controlled at the level of a few parts per million and monitored in real time.

        "abstract": "Small-scale vortices in the solar photosphere play a central role in transporting mass, energy, and momentum into the upper solar atmosphere, yet reliably detecting these structures remains rather challenging. We address this problem by introducing a simple preprocessing step that normalises the velocity field by its magnitude. Our method preserves flow topology while suppressing shear-induced artefacts that lead to spurious detections in non-uniform, high-rotation environments. For validation, we apply this approach to high-resolution Bifrost simulations and evaluate vortex detection using four commonly employed methods: IVD, the $\\lambda_2$-criterion, the Q-criterion, and the $\\Gamma$ method. We assess which structures exhibit physically consistent rotation by using the $d$-criterion to automatically detect rotational plasma-flow features, which we use as an approximate ground truth. We find that, in the unnormalised field, a substantial fraction of detections made by the first three methods are false positive detections. Normalisation removes most of these. The $\\Gamma$ method detects true vortices but misses a large number of vortical flows. The normalisation step yields better-defined and more realistic vortex boundaries. As the $\\Gamma$ method underpins most observational analyses, current studies likely capture only a subset of vortical flows. By comparison, the other three methods detect four to five times more vortices after normalisation, suggesting that the true photospheric vortex coverage may be underestimated by a similar factor. Overall, this physically motivated preprocessing step enhances the accuracy and physical realism of vortex detection and offers a practical enhancement for analysing vortical flows in turbulent flows.",

        "abstract": "Some plasma instability thresholds, derived from linear theory, constrain the observed parameters of solar wind velocity distributions, defining boundaries of ``allowed'' plasma parameters. These thresholds typically account for a single source of free energy, such as temperature anisotropy or a drifting secondary component with some dependence on other system parameters, e.g. the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure, $\\beta$. Excursions beyond these thresholds result in the emission of energy, transferred from particles to coherent electromagnetic waves, acting to push the system toward a more stable configuration. In this work, we use linear theory to define parametric limits for a low-$\\beta$ plasma that contains a drifting proton beam or helium ($\\alpha$)-particle population. A sufficiently fast and dense drifting population triggers an Oblique Drift Instability (ODI). This instability decreases the velocity drift between the thermal proton and secondary populations and prevents $\\beta$ from decreasing below a minimum value by heating both the core and drifting populations. Our predictions are of interest for \\emph{Parker Solar Probe} observations, as they provide an additional mechanism for perpendicular heating of ions active in the vicinity of \\Alfven surface. The ODI also explains the discrepancy between long-standing expectations of measurements of very low-$\\beta$ plasmas with very large temperature anisotropies in the near-Sun environment and in situ observations, where $\\beta$ is consistently measured above a few percent and the secondary populations drifting faster than the bulk of proton population by no more than approximately one \\Alfven velocity.",

Numerical simulations of charge-neutral binary systems of both symmetric and asymmetric mass configurations show orbital decay, circularization, and monotonic Hamiltonian decrease consistent with dipole radiative losses.

        "abstract": "The mechanism that forms dynamic type II spicules has remained elusive for many years. Their dynamical behaviour has long been linked to magnetic reconnection, yet no conclusive evidence has been provided. However, one recent observational study found signs of reconnection, as traced by Ellerman bombs (EBs), at the footpoints of many spicules. The triggering of EBs is generally linked to reconnection due to flux emergence and convective motions in the photosphere. We aim to explore whether we can connect EBs to type II spicules, and to what extent we can use EBs as an observational proxy to probe reconnection in this dynamic. We also aim to provide further insight into the mechanisms that trigger EBs. We used a simulation run with the radiative magnetohydrodynamics code Bifrost to track spicules and study the physical processes behind their formation. To detect EBs and classify the spicules, we synthesised the H-alpha line using the multilevel radiative transfer code RH1.5D. We also traced shocks and current sheets to decipher the origin of EBs and spicules. We selected one type II spicule with a strong EB near its footpoint and studied their formation in detail. A magnetoacoustic shock advects the magnetic field lines towards an oppositely directed ambient field, creating a current sheet. The current sheet accelerates dense plasma via a whiplash effect generated by reconnection into the inclined ambient field, launching the spicule. Several EB profiles trace shock- and magnetic-reconnection-induced dynamics during this process at the spicule footpoint. We present a new EB triggering mechanism in which a shock-induced current sheet reconnects, triggering an EB in the lower solar atmosphere. The shock-induced current sheet generates the launch of a type II spicule via reconnection outflows. These results provide a physical origin for the observed connection between EBs and spicules.",

        "abstract": "Studying young protoplanetary disks is essential for understanding planet formation, but traditional angular differential imaging can introduce self-subtraction artefacts that hinder interpretation of small-scale structures. We present high-resolution total- and polarized-intensity Ks-band images of the LkCa~15 system obtained with SPHERE using near-simultaneous reference-star differential imaging (star-hopping), yielding self-subtraction-free images beyond 0.1 arcsec. LkCa~15 hosts a ~160 au protoplanetary disk and has previously been reported to harbour candidate protoplanets at separations of 15--18 au. We analyse the disk morphology and dust properties and search for super-Jupiter planets beyond 20 au. We first model the near-infrared scattered-light images together with ALMA submillimetre continuum data using RADMC-3D and a two grain-size (micron and millimetre) compact olivine model. While this model broadly reproduces the disk geometry, it overpredicts the degree of forward scattering in the near-infrared. To investigate this discrepancy, we extract the scattering phase function S(theta) and polarized fraction P(theta) from the SPHERE data and compare them with aggregate-scattering models. The observed phase functions disfavour compact Mie spheres and are better matched by porous aggregates (CAHP). Recomputing the scattered-light models with porous CAHP grains in the disk surface layer significantly improves agreement with the observed Ks-band morphology and polarization, while retaining compact millimetre grains to reproduce the ALMA continuum. No new planetary companions are detected; we place upper mass limits of ~1.5 MJ beyond 200 au and ~3.6 MJ in the inner disk. Our results demonstrate that combining star-hopping imaging with phase-function diagnostics provides strong constraints on dust grain properties in protoplanetary disks.",

In particular, the null energy condition (NEC) remains violated in the vicinity of the wormhole throat, ensuring the traversable nature of the geometry. For magnetized configurations, the resulting WH+NS systems can become extremely massive, with ADM masses exceeding $8\\,M_\\odot$, and can exhibit large surface redshifts exceeding $z \\simeq 1.5$. Furthermore, we analyze the gravitational-wave echo time of the systems, which serves as a potential observational imprint.

        "abstract": "We report on a search for prompt, low-frequency radio emission from the gravitational-wave (GW) merger S250206dm using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA). Early alerts favored a neutron-star-containing merger, making this a compelling target. Motivated by theoretical predictions of coherent radio bursts from mergers involving a neutron star, we utilized the OVRO-LWA Time Machine system to analyze voltage data recorded around the time of the event. The Time Machine is a two-stage voltage buffer and processing pipeline that continuously buffers raw data from all antennas across the array's nearly full-hemisphere instantaneous field of view, enabling retrospective beamforming, dedispersion, and fast-transient candidate identification. For this event, we analyzed a 30-minute interval beginning 3.5 minutes after the merger, which included two minutes of pre-alert data recovered by the ring buffer. We searched the 50% localization probability region with millisecond time resolution in the 69-86 MHz frequency band. No radio counterpart was detected above a 7-sigma fluence detection threshold of ~150 Jy ms. Using Bayesian analysis, we place a 95% confidence upper limit on the source luminosity of L95 = 4 x 10^41 erg s^-1. These constraints start to probe the bright end of the coherent-emission parameter space predicted by jet-ISM shock processes, magnetar and blitzar-like mechanisms, and recent simulation-based scenarios for neutron-star-containing mergers. This study presents the first sensitive, large-area, millisecond-timescale search for prompt low-frequency radio emission from a GW merger with the OVRO-LWA, establishing a framework in which about ten additional events will yield stringent population-level constraints.",

        "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are key drivers of space weather events, posing risks to both space-borne and ground-based systems. Accurate prediction of their arrival time at Earth is critical for impact mitigation. To this end, physics-informed artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have proven more effective than purely data-driven or physics-based methods, generally offering higher accuracy and better explainability than the former and lower computational cost than the latter. In this work, we propose a generalization of the physics-driven AI framework based on the classical drag-based model (DBM) by integrating the extended version of the drag-based model (EDBM). This enhancement allows us to include in the training process CME events whose interplanetary dynamics are incompatible with those assumed by the DBM. We achieve travel-time prediction accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We also perform a parametric robustness analysis, highlighting the stability of our approach under small variations in the drag coefficient. Furthermore, we propose a categorization of CMEs into speed regimes defined by the EDBM using a multiclass classification model based on logistic regression, which could be implemented in near-real-time operational space weather forecasting systems. The results show that the EDBM framework broadens the applicability of forecasting models while preserving good predictive accuracy.",

Our analysis spans quiescent, high, and pre-eruption dip states. We find that brightening amplitudes increase toward shorter wavelengths in both optical and UV bands, while the UV and X-ray fluxes are generally anti-correlated throughout all phases. During the 2023-2024 pre-eruption dip, soft and hard X-rays increased as optical and ultraviolet (UV) brightness declined, consistent with a transition from an optically thick to thin boundary layer driven by a reduction in the accretion rate. We also report, for the first time, a second, lower-amplitude dip occurring between September 2024 and February 2025 following the primary 2023-2024 pre-eruption dip.

The resulting metric function is asymptotically Schwarzschild but carries a characteristic Q^3/(9\\xi^2 r^4) correction, where $Q$ is the magnetic charge and $\\xi$ is the nonlinear electrodynamics parameter, with the conventional Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om term Q^2/r^2 absent. We analyze the horizon structure and construct three-dimensional embedding diagrams to visualize spatial geometry. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we compute the weak-field deflection angle in vacuum, cold plasma, and axion-plasmon media, finding that the nonlinear electromagnetic corrections reduce the total bending compared to Schwarzschild at fixed Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass. The gravitational redshift, Joule-Thomson expansion coefficient, and heat capacity are derived, revealing phase transitions and inversion curves that depend on the model parameters. We obtain closed-form expressions for the photon sphere radius, Lyapunov exponent, and shadow size, demonstrating their sensitivity to Q and $\\xi$ along observable Intensities. Fully relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion show that the confining geometry produces a $\\sim 40\\%$ enhancement in mass accretion rate relative to Schwarzschild and generates quasi-periodic oscillations with stable 3:2 and 2:1 frequency ratios matching observations from black hole X-ray binaries.

However, analogous short-time scale field changes preceding eruptions are rarely reported. In this study, we present the first detailed analysis of a pre-flare decrease in the photospheric horizontal magnetic field ($B_h$) associated with an X1.8 class flare, using high-cadence vector magnetic field data from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We identify a region of gradual, spatially coherent $B_h$ decrease of about 100 G along the flaring polarity inversion line (PIL) during 30 minutes preceding the flare. This decrease is accompanied by a decrease in the force-free parameter $\\alpha_w$, with no significant flux emergence or cancellation observed. After the flare onset, $B_h$ exhibited contrasting behaviors in different sub-regions: a step-like increase near the PIL and a continued decrease in surrounding regions, suggesting that the pre-flare $B_h$ decrease may also have a coronal origin, like its post-flare counterparts. Coronal imaging from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard SDO reveals that the associated erupting filament underwent a slow-rise phase before the flare, whose timing and location closely matches the occurrence of the pre-flare $B_h$ decrease. We propose that the slow-rise of the pre-eruptive filament stretched overlying coronal loops, increasing their verticality and thereby reducing $B_h$ at their photospheric footpoints. The results present the first detailed analysis of a pre-flare $B_h$ decrease and suggest it as a precursor to solar eruptions, causally linked to early filament activation and its impact on the photosphere.",

Our analysis reveals the presence of a tidal gap between black holes, characterized by vanishing tidal deformability, and physically motivated ECOs. Prompted by this finding, we investigate the possibility that a population of maximally compact exotic objects, described by a linear equation of state (EoS), may simultaneously inhabit the lower mass gap and the sub-solar region, thus qualifying as (primordial) black hole mimickers while distinguishing themselves from the latter by their non-zero tidal deformability. Finally, considering the case of solitonic boson stars as proxies for ECOs described by a linear EoS, we discuss how it is possible to further reduce the lower limit on $\\Lambda$, provided that the strong energy condition is violated (but not the dominant energy condition, and therefore causality).",

However, some metric type II bursts have occasionally been reported to occur in the absence of a CME and to be associated with weak solar activities. This study aims to identify the driver of the coronal shock in this kind of type II event. We investigate a high-frequency metric type II burst with clear band splitting, observed simultaneously by the Chashan Broadband Solar radio spectrograph and the Nan\\c{c}ay Radioheliograph. It is associated with a C3.1-class flare and a small-scale jet, but without a detectable CME in the coronagraphs. The type II burst is preceded by multiple type III bursts, one of which exhibits characteristics of a type N burst. The type II burst source is associated with the jet-induced perturbation front propagating through nearby closed loops at a speed of $\\sim$880 km s$^{-1}$, rather than the much slower jet front. This suggests that the disturbance initiated by the jet can convert to a shock wave within low Alfv\\'enic coronal loops, providing the necessary conditions for electron acceleration and subsequent radio emission. Our findings offer new insights into the formation mechanism of high-frequency type II bursts associated with weak flares and jets.",

        "abstract": "Improved measurements of $B$-modes in the cosmic microwave background can be obtained through accurate calibration of the orientation of detector antennas as projected onto the sky. Miscalibration of the detector polarization angle leads to a leakage of $E$-modes into $B$-modes, which can bias the detection of the latter. To achieve a $\\sigma(r)$ of 0.003, the Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes are required to calibrate the global polarization angle on the sky with an accuracy ${\\lesssim}0.1^\\circ$. We demonstrate a fully remote-controllable calibration system using a ``sparse wire grid,\" which injects a rotatable linear polarized signal across the telescope's focal plane. This calibration system is installed and operational on a Small Aperture Telescope at its observing site at the Parque Astron\\'omico in the Atacama desert in Chile. We developed a pipeline for the detector polarization angle calibration, and demonstrate it using initial data for 93~GHz and 145~GHz frequency bands. The observed distribution of detector polarization angles is in agreement with the instrument design. Statistical uncertainties for the relatively calibrated polarization angles are $0.02^\\circ$ and $0.03^\\circ$ at 93~GHz and 145~GHz, respectively. Systematic uncertainty was evaluated to be $0.08^\\circ$ at the hardware development and fabrication stage. Their sum in quadrature is less than $0.1^\\circ$.",

        "abstract": "Coronal cavities, often associated with prominences, are crucial structures in understanding coronal heating and the eruption mechanism of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). Previous studies have identified their lower density, higher temperature, and flux rope structures. However, spectroscopic observations are still relatively scarce. In this study, we utilize the newly developed Spectral Imaging Coronagraph (SICG), Chinese H$\\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE), and AIA/SDO to analyze the morphology, temperature, Doppler shift, and non-thermal velocity of two coronal cavities observed on November 13, 2024. We find that coronal cavities are distinctly visible in SICG \\ion{Fe}{14} 5303~\\AA\\ and AIA 193~\\AA, whereas they are nearly absent in SICG \\ion{Fe}{10} 6374~\\AA\\ and AIA 171~\\AA. The spectroscopic measurements show that the two coronal cavities display asymmetric, ring-like structures in the \\ion{Fe}{14} 5303~\\AA\\ Doppler shift maps. The non-thermal velocities inside coronal cavities are significantly higher than those of the surrounding streamer areas. In addition, the core regions of coronal cavities, located directly above the prominences, exhibit the highest non-thermal velocities and Doppler velocities. Our results suggest the presence of waves and turbulence in coronal cavities, which are likely more intense than those in the adjacent streamer regions. We suggest that the interaction and exchange between the cold, dense prominence materials and the hot, low-density coronal materials are the main drivers of the waves and turbulence inside coronal cavities.",

In this respect, particularly interesting are the sources whose synchrotron emission covers a broad range of frequencies, from radio to X-rays, such as the BL Lac objects of the HSP type. Previous measurements including radio, optical and X-ray data show a clear trend, with the degree of polarization increasing with frequency. Here we report radio, optical and X-ray observations ($Swift$, $Nustar$ and $IXPE$) of 1ES 1101-232 and RGB J0710+591, two blazars belonging to the puzzling subclass of extreme BL Lacs (EHBL). For 1ES 1101-232 we found a strong frequency-dependency of the degree of polarization (with a ratio $\\Pi_X/\\Pi_O\\simeq 5.2$). For RGB J0710+591, IXPE derived a 1$\\sigma$ upper limit $\\Pi_X<11.6\\%$, comparable with the measured optical degree of polarization (average $\\Pi_O\\sim 12\\%$). We discuss the results in the framework of current interpretations and, in particular, we report an improved version of the stratified shock model that is able to reproduce the observed data of both sources.",

The frequency-dependent circular polarization of single pulses, with high signal-to-noise ratios, is recorded by the FAST, which shows great diversity, and we are trying an effort to understand such circular polarization based on the wave mode coupling in the limiting polarization region, and consequently to constrain the dynamical parameters. By quantitatively comparing models with data using Bayesian analysis, it is found that the plasma multiplicity is approximately between $10^0$ and $10^{2}$, while the Lorentz factor of the particles between $10^{0.5}$ and $10^{2}$.

Here we search for signals associated with a Vela glitch on 29 April 2024 in data of the two LIGO detectors from the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run. We search both for seconds-scale burst-like emission, primarily from fundamental (f-)mode oscillations, and for longer quasi-monochromatic transients up to four months in duration, primarily from quasi-static quadrupolar deformations. We find no significant detection candidates, but for the first time we set direct observational upper limits on gravitational strain amplitude that are stricter than what can be indirectly inferred from the overall glitch energy scale. We discuss the short- and long-duration observational constraints in the context of specific emission models. These results demonstrate the potential of gravitational-wave probes of glitching pulsars as detector sensitivity continues to improve.",

We find that they are consistent when the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS is around 1 km in diameter. For a recent solution with a time lag in the acceleration from Eubanks et al, we find diameters between 820 meters and 1050 meters, assuming an outgassing asymmetry factor $\\zeta=0.5$ and a density of the comet nucleus $\\rho=0.5$ g cm$^{-3}$. The limits on the diameter scale as $(\\zeta/\\rho)^{1/3}$.

The prompt detection of such neutrino signals offers a unique opportunity to trigger early follow-up observations in the EM domain. We aim to assess the feasibility and efficiency of an optical-NIR follow-up strategy for CCSNe discovered via neutrino bursts, by modelling the spatial distribution of events and simulating realistic observational campaigns taking into account the size of the localization error box generated by triangulating the neutrino burst. We modelled the Galactic distribution of CCSNe, including the effects of interstellar extinction, and considered three main progenitor types: Wolf-Rayet stars, red and blue supergiants. We included the shock breakout in the EM signatures that could be detected following the neutrino burst. A population of CCSNe was generated and detected by different networks of neutrino observatories, including IceCube, KM3NeT, Super-Kamiokande, Hyper-Kamiokande, and JUNO. The resulting skymaps were used as input for GWEMOPT to produce optimized follow-up plans with two optical facilities: LSST and the TAROT robotic telescopes. Both LSST and TAROT exhibit comparable detection efficiencies for the simulated CCSN population. However, the TAROT network achieves similar success rates while requiring fewer pointings to cover the CCSN skymap. Our simulations demonstrate that neutrino follow-up campaigns can effectively CCSN optical counterparts using both large and small facilities. Depending on the neutrino network, the median number of pointings for the two tested optical facilities is of the order of 20 to 100 to find the EM emission. The number of images is larger for LSST than for TAROT by a factor of 2 to 4.",

Since photometry for most PLATO targets will be extracted on board, an efficient strategy to detect false positives (FPs), defined as transit-like signals not caused by planets, is required. Centroid shifts are a standard FP diagnostic, but only 5% to 20% of PLATO's largest stellar sample (P5) will have centroids computed on board, motivating the need for an alternative strategy. We propose a double-aperture photometry approach to detect FPs, testing two mask types: extended masks, which enlarge the nominal aperture, and secondary masks, centered on the main contaminant. For each mask type, we derive flux and centroid-shift metrics and evaluate their ability to discriminate FPs. Using Gaia DR3, we define P5 targets and their background stars, which are assumed to be eclipsing binaries with transit depths and durations drawn from observed distributions. From simulated photometry and centroid shifts, we compute extended and secondary fluxes as well as extended, secondary, and nominal centroids, and compare their FP detection efficiency. Under these assumptions, approximately 35% of P5 targets have a single FP-producing contaminant and about 22% have two or more. Secondary flux achieves the highest detection efficiency (92%), followed by extended centroid shifts (87%) and nominal centroids (84%). Owing to its lower computational and telemetry cost, double-aperture photometry provides an efficient solution for rejecting a large fraction of FP signals caused by eclipsing binaries.",

        "abstract": "In the standard model, magnetic reconnection at a vertical current sheet above the flare arcade is key to explaining many aspects of solar eruptions. The supra-arcade region is where the vertical current sheet is supposedly located, and X-ray/EUV emission therein reflects underlying energy release and transport processes, therefore providing valuable insight into the structure and evolution of the current sheet. Previous studies have focused primarily on the impulsive phase of flares, but phenomena in the decay phase are also crucial for understanding the complete flaring scenario. In this paper, we investigated an M6.7-class limb flare that occurred on August 28, 2022, combining observations from the Solar Orbiter (SolO) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Coronal X-ray sources are continually observed by the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) onboard SolO for over two hours, revealing a multi-phase evolution with varying velocities and multiple substructures, with higher-energy components consistently appearing at higher altitudes. Such a height-energy relation is notably observed in a double coronal source during the decay-phase, which is dominated by thermal emission. The energy distribution of the double source distinguish itself from previous studies that showed a symmetric distribution, with the higher-energy components being closer to the center of the double source during the impulsive phase. Obtained from two opposite side-on perspectives on the supra-arcade region, these findings reveal the spatio-temporal complexity of the energy release process in the post-flare current sheet during the decay phase.",

        "abstract": "In this letter, we investigate the population of energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfv\\'en waves (SAWs) using more than 20 years of data provided by the Wind spacecraft near 1 au. We refer to SAWs as energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfv\\'en waves within inertial range scales. Key parameters such as normalized cross helicity, plasma incompressibility, and magnetic incompressibility are used to determine the SAWs. Incorporating the polarity of the heliospheric magnetic field, AW modes are identified, which enables the determination of the propagation direction. Occurrence rates of SAWs vary from 1% to 14% depending on the time scale and solar wind stream type considered. Particularly, the relationship between large-scale magnetic field switchbacks (SBs) and SAWs (for a 1-hour long time scale) is investigated. A methodology utilizing pitch angle distributions of suprathermal electron strahl is employed to identify inverted magnetic field topology. The intervals containing SAWs are cross-referenced and examined with intervals identified as SBs. For a sample of 1636 1-hour SAW intervals, 17.5% are associated with magnetic field switchbacks occurring at scales larger than one hour. The analysis lends support to the idea of switchbacks as one of the candidate sources for a portion of the SAW population.",

        "abstract": "In 2025 July, the third-ever interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, was discovered on its ingress into the Solar System. Similar to the NASA Voyager missions sent in 1977, science probes by extraterrestrial life (artifact ``technosignatures'') could be sent to explore other stellar systems like our own. In this campaign, we used the SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array to observe 3I/ATLAS from 1--9~GHz. We detected nearly 74 million narrowband hits in 7.25~hr of data using the newly-developed search pipeline \\texttt{bliss}. We then applied blanking in frequency and drift rate to mitigate Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) in our dataset, narrowing the dataset down to $\\sim$2 million hits. These hits were further filtered by the localization code \\texttt{NBeamAnalysis}, and the remaining 211 hits were visually inspected in the time-frequency domain. We did not find any signals worthy of additional follow-up. Accounting for the Doppler drift correction and given the non-detection, we are able to set an Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) upper limit of $10-110$~W on radio technosignatures from 3I/ATLAS across the frequency and drift rate ranges covered by our survey.",

We, furthermore, examine the relation between pre-outburst duration and the peak & integrated count rates of the upcoming outburst. We show that outbursts following longer quiescent periods tend to be more energetic.",

        "abstract": "Imaging Fabry-P\\'erot Interferometer (FPI) observations are commonly used in solar physics to infer physical parameters in the photosphere and chromosphere through modeling of the observations. Such techniques require detailed knowledge of the spectral instrumental profile in order to produce accurate results. We present a method to characterize the spatial variation of parameters of dual-etalon FPI instruments mounted in telecentric configuration: spatially-resolved cavity separation and reflectivities of both etalons, and the prefilter variation across the field-of-view. We aim at characterizing the field-of-view dependence of the parameters of the new CRISP2 FPI. We have implemented a forward model of the FPI instrumental degradation combined with a template average quiet-Sun spectra at disk center in order to model two sets of observational data. Our method does not require any change in the optical setup or the utilization of external sources of illumination. We assess the validity of several functional forms in the calculation of the FPI transmission profiles. Our results show that (generally) the inclusion of the secondary transmission peaks at 1 times the Free Spectral Range and a detailed estimate of the prefilter curve is necessary to obtain accurate values of both etalon reflectivities. For narrow prefilters (relative to the FSR), the former requirement can be relaxed. Our results show that the cavity separation of CRISP2 is very flat, showing an RMS variation below 1.9 nm over the entire field-of-view for both etalons. Reflectivity RMS variations are 0.4% and 0.3% for the primary and secondary etalons at 617.3 nm. We have assessed data and modeling requirements in order to derive accurate FPI parameters and minimize errors in the determination of etalon reflectivities.",

We extend the shadow analysis to homogeneous and inhomogeneous plasma environments, demonstrating systematic reductions in the observed shadow size, and compute the weak gravitational lensing deflection angle in plasma using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The perturbative dynamics are investigated for scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac fields, with quasinormal mode frequencies obtained via the sixth-order WKB approximation and greybody factors calculated using the rigorous bounds method. The resulting Hawking radiation spectra reveal distinct signatures for bosonic and fermionic emission channels. We further analyze quasi-periodic oscillations by deriving the fundamental orbital frequencies and applying both parametric resonance and relativistic precession models, obtaining constraints from observations.",

While significant effort is devoted to advancing the technical capabilities of future astronomical facilities, frameworks for coordinating and sustaining the associated community systems are often developed in parallel rather than embedded as coherent, long-term structures at the scale needed to fully realise this ambition. In this white paper, submitted as part of the ESO Expanding Horizons initiative, we draw on experience from established observatories and emerging collaborations to identify key community-level challenges. We argue that a central and transversal scientific challenge for the 2040s is to operate a flagship observatory in which access to telescope time, data, leadership, training, and career development is equitable across institutions, member states, and beyond. We propose that access and participation be treated as integral design parameters, embedded from the conceptual stage and sustained throughout the facility lifecycle, in order to ensure long-term scientific excellence, sustainability, and societal return.",

        "abstract": "The Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) hosts science-ready data products from over twenty NASA missions, plus community-contributed data collections, and other select surveys. The data support forefront research in the ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared wavelength bands. We have constructed bibliographies for each mission from publications in nearly 40 professional journals, and have identified more than 37,000 refereed articles where investigators made a science usage of data hosted in MAST. The publication rate over the last 50 years shows that most MAST missions have had very high productivity during their in-service lifetimes, and have remained so for years or decades afterward. Annual citations to these publications, a measure of impact on research, are robust for most missions, with citations that grow over more than a decade. Most of the citations come from about 10% of articles within each mission.   We examined the bibliographies of the active missions HST and JWST in greater detail. For HST the rate of archival publications exceeded those authored by the original observing teams within a decade of launch, and is now more than 3 times higher. Early indications hint that JWST archival articles could dominate the publication rate even sooner. The production of articles resulting from any given observing program can extend for decades. Programs with small and very large allocations of observing time tend to be particularly productive per unit of observing time. For HST in general, a first publication appears within 1.5 yr for 50% of observing programs, and within 3.8 yr for 80% of programs. We discuss various external factors that affect publication metrics, their strengths and limitations for measuring scientific impact, and the challenges of making meaningful comparisons of publication metrics across missions.",

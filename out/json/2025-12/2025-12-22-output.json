        "abstract": "We use the IllustrisTNG300-ODM simulation to investigate the spin bias of low-mass halos and its connection to the strong clustering of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) reported by Zhang et al. (2025). By comparing two halo spin definitions-one using only bound particles ($\\lambda_{\\rm b}$) and another including unbound particles ($\\lambda_{\\rm a}$)-we demonstrate that the spin bias of low-mass halos critically depends on the definition. While $\\lambda_{\\rm a}$ yields stronger clustering for higher-spin halos at all masses, $\\lambda_{\\rm b}$ produces an inverted trend below $M_{\\rm h}\\sim 10^{11} \\rm M_{\\odot}/h$. This discrepancy is driven by a subset of halos in high-density environments that have large $\\lambda_{\\rm a}$ but small $\\lambda_{\\rm b}$. Using an empirical model implemented in SDSS-like mocks, we link the stellar surface-mass-density ($\\Sigma_\\ast$) of a galaxy to $\\lambda_{\\rm a}$ of its host halo and find an anti-correlation that more diffuse dwarfs tend to reside in higher-spin halos. The model naturally reproduces the observed strong clustering of UDGs within the standard $\\Lambda$CDM framework without invoking exotic assumptions such as self-interacting dark matter. The high fraction of unbound particles in UDG hosts likely originates from tidal fields in dense regions, an effect particularly significant for low-mass halos. We discuss how the angular momentum of a halo represented by $\\lambda_{\\rm a}$ may be transferred to the gas to affect size and surface density of the galaxy that forms in the halo.",

        "abstract": "We infer the ages of three young stellar clusters, NGC 2004, NGC 7419, and NGC 2100, using Stellar Ages, a statistical algorithm designed to infer stellar population properties from color magnitude diagrams. Recent studies have revealed emerging inconsistencies in the inferred ages of very young stellar clusters with ages less than or equal to 50 Myr. Here, we identify and quantify two distinct discrepancies. First, we identify a systematic age offset of 0.55 plus minus 0.09 dex between red supergiant and bright blue star age estimates, equivalent to a factor of approximately 3.5 in linear age, with bright blue star ages appearing systematically younger than those inferred from red supergiants. Second, given the observed numbers of red supergiants and bright blue stars, we find a pronounced deficit of lower-mass main-sequence stars relative to expectations from a standard initial mass function. Although these discrepancies resemble those reported for intermediate-age clusters, their magnitude and character suggest that they are unique to the evolution of massive stars. Together, these results highlight population-level inconsistencies with single-star evolutionary models and underscore the need to consider multiple evolutionary tracers when age-dating young clusters. By combining individual stellar ages with population-wide constraints, our approach refines prior work on cluster age determinations and provides new insight into massive star evolution and the interpretation of cluster demographics.",

        "abstract": "The evolution of galaxies in groups is profoundly influenced by a variety of physical processes, with ram pressure and tidal interactions playing pivotal roles in shaping their structural and evolutionary pathways. The relative influence of these two processes is still debated in groups compared to clusters, as ram pressure is less understood there. We study NGC 2276, a nearby galaxy (z$\\sim$0.0079) where the dominant process is still an open question. We examine the distribution of stellar populations in NGC 2276 using multiwavelength data to assess potential evidence of tidal interactions and ram-pressure stripping. We present the first HST WFC3/UVIS images of NGC 2276, and use them to investigate the distribution of stellar populations across the disk of NGC 2276, where we assume that the bluer broadband filters mainly trace younger stellar populations, while the redder filters trace mainly older stellar populations. Furthermore, by comparing HST images with maps of H$\\alpha$ emission from Calar Alto's PMAS/PPAK integral field unit (IFU) and near-IR maps from Spitzer's IRAC, we identify arm-like overdensity features that trace the spiral structure of this galaxy and tracked the variation of their pitch angle with radius. Our results indicate that the distribution of the stellar populations is asymmetrical. The youngest stellar populations (up to $\\sim$100 Myr) show higher concentration on the leading side of the galaxy and are more diffuse on the trailing side, consistent with gas compression due to ram-pressure. This asymmetry is visible in the red filters as well. We also show that the average pitch angles of the overdensity features increase with galactocentric distance. Our findings are consistent with the fact that ram pressure is the leading mechanism for the peculiar morphology of NGC 2276, but do not exclude the possibility that tidal interactions could have played a role.",

The detection of both oxygen auroral lines allows for dual-zone direct $T_e$ measurements and expands the dynamic range in $12+\\log\\mathrm{(O/H)}$ (7.68 to 8.65 dex), stellar mass ($10^{8}$ to $10^{10.4}$ M$_\\odot$), and star-formation rate ($1$ to $100$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) compared to previous direct $T_e$ studies of the high-redshift MZR and FMR. We characterize the $z\\sim2$ MZR and find a slope of $0.27\\pm0.04$ and normalization of $12+\\log\\mathrm{(O/H)} = 8.44\\pm0.04$ at $10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$ with an intrinsic scatter of 0.10 dex, consistent with past strong-line MZR measurements. Comparisons with $z\\sim2$ predictions from six simulations reveal that none reproduce our observed MZR normalization evolution between $z\\sim0$ and $z\\sim2$. This discrepancy suggests current models do not fully capture the chemical enrichment and feedback processes occurring at cosmic noon. However, all 34 galaxies are on or above the star-forming main sequence such that our sample may be biased towards lower $12+\\log\\mathrm{(O/H)}$ if the FMR persists at $z\\sim2$. Correcting for this selection effect would increase O/H by $\\approx0.1$ dex at 10$^{9.3}$ M$_\\odot$ (the median mass of our sample) bringing our MZR into better agreement with that of \\texttt{TNG}. Lastly, we find our $z\\sim2.3$ sample is consistent with the $z\\sim0$ FMR within 0.1 dex in O/H, indicating that the smooth secular mechanisms regulating chemical enrichment, star formation, stellar mass, and outflows were in place at cosmic noon.",

Dynamo action determines their dynamical structure and strength. Simulations of combined large- and small-scale dynamos have successfully developed mean fields with strength and topology consistent with observations but with turbulent fields much weaker than observed, while simulations of small-scale dynamos with parameters relevant to the interstellar medium yield turbulent fields an order of magnitude below the values observed or expected theoretically. We use the Pencil Code accelerated on GPUs with Astaroth to perform high-resolution simulations of a supernova-driven galactic dynamo including heating and cooling in a periodic domain. Our models show that the strength of the turbulent field produced by the small-scale dynamo approaches an asymptote at only modest magnetic Prandtl numbers. This allows us to use these models to suggest the essential characteristics of this constituent of the magnetic field for inclusion in global galactic models. The asymptotic limit occurs already at magnetic Prandtl number of only a few hundred, many orders of magnitude below physical values in the the interstellar medium and consistent with previous findings for isothermal compressible flows.",

By training a Neural Network model on high-quality spectroscopic temperatures from the Gaia-ESO Survey as the response variable, and using photometric data from Gaia DR3 and 2MASS catalogs as explanatory variables, we implemented a methodology to accurately derive the effective temperatures of much larger populations of stars for which only photometric data are available. The model demonstrated robust performance for low-mass stars with temperatures below 7000 K, including young stars, the primary focus of this work. Predicted temperatures were employed to construct Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams and to predict stellar ages of different young clusters and star forming regions through isochrone interpolation, achieving excellent agreement with spectroscopic-based ages and literature values derived from model-independent methods like lithium equivalent widths. The inclusion of starspot evolutionary models improved the age predictions, providing a more accurate description of stellar properties. Additionally, the results regarding the effective temperature and age predictions of the young clusters provide evidence for intrinsic age spreads in the youngest clusters, suggesting multiple formation events over time.",

Recently, it was highlighted that a small admixture of $\\sim1\\%$ ($f_{\\rm CDM} \\sim\\!0.01$) cold dark matter (CDM) endowed with a blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum could offset the WDM-induced suppression and relax the WDM mass bound by a factor of $\\mathcal{O}(10)$. If viable, this ''warm + cold-isocurvature'' scenario would allow sub-keV WDM particles to constitute nearly the full dark matter abundance while potentially alleviating some small-scale tensions. In this work, we test this mechanism by constraining the WDM mass $m_{\\rm WDM}$ while marginalizing over CDM isocurvature parameters. We combine ultraviolet luminosity function measurements from the \\textit{Hubble Space Telescope} and \\textit{James Webb Space Telescope} over redshift $4 \\leq z \\leq 11$ with CMB, BAO, and SNe data. For a pure WDM model, our joint analysis yields a lower bound $m_{\\rm WDM} > 1.8~\\mathrm{keV}$ (95% credible intervals). When CDM isocurvature is introduced at $f_{\\rm CDM} = 0.01$, the limit relaxes to $m_{\\rm WDM} > 0.27~\\mathrm{keV}$ (95% credible intervals), reflecting a shallow degeneracy in which blue-tilted isocurvature fluctuations partially compensate for WDM suppression. These results provide new constraints on thermal WDM in the presence of CDM isocurvature fluctuations and quantify the extent to which such fluctuations can mask the small-scale signatures of light relics.",

To make transformative progress on these questions we must characterize the physical and kinematic properties (integrated and spatially resolved) of stellar populations in galaxies, fossil record of their past star formation and assembly histories, together with gas properties, across a wide range of masses and environmental scales, over this critical cosmic epoch. Volume-representative samples of 10^6 galaxies down to 10^9 solar masses are essential to fully trace the complex interplay between physical processes and to physically connect progenitor and descendant galaxy populations. This demands a deep and extensive survey with high signal-to-noise, medium-resolution, rest-frame optical spectroscopy. Current and planned facilities in the 2020-2030s cannot simultaneously achieve the required sample size, spectral quality, mass limit, and spatial coverage. A dedicated large-aperture spectroscopic facility with wide-area high-multiplex MOS and large field-of-view IFU is needed to provide transformative insights into the physical mechanisms regulating star formation and galaxy evolution.",

        "abstract": "Aims. This study aims to determine empirical intrinsic edges of the classical Cepheids instability strip (IS) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) galaxy, considering various effects that alter its shape, and compare them with theoretical models and other galaxies. Methods. We used the data of classical fundamental-mode (F) and first-overtone mode (1O) SMC Cepheids from the OGLE-IV variable star catalog, with the final cleaned sample including 2388 F and 1560 1O Cepheids. The IS borders are determined by tracing the edges of the color distribution along the strip. Based on that, and using evolutionary tracks, the IS crossing times are computed. Results. We obtained the blue and red edges of the IS in V- and I-photometric bands and in the HR diagram, and detected breaks at periods between 1.4 and 3 days. A comparison with existing theoretical models showed good agreement for the blue edge and significant differences for the red edge. We also found that the IS of the SMC is wider than that of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), with its red edge being redder despite its lower metallicity. The analysis of crossing times showed that the expected number of Cepheids as a function of period agrees with the observed distribution for P > 1 days but differs for P < 1 days. Conclusions. Slope changes along the SMC IS borders are most likely explained by the distribution of metallicity. The behavior of the blue loops at the SMC metallicity is not consistent with observations, and at the LMC metallicity, the blue loops are too short for lower-mass stars. A comparison of theoretical edges with our empirical ISs imposes constraints on the models and enables the identification of valid ones. Based on the positions of the breaks, our study also suggests that fundamental-mode Cepheids with periods longer than 3 days should be used for distance determination.",

        "abstract": "Ly$\\alpha$ blobs (LABs) are large, spatially extended Ly$\\alpha$-emitting objects whose nature remains unclear. Their statistical properties such as number densities and luminosity functions are still uncertain because of small sample sizes and large cosmic variance. The One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey, with its large volume, offers an opportunity to overcome these limitations. We describe our LAB selection method and present 112 new LABs in the 9 deg$^2$ E-COSMOS field. We begin with the conventional LAB selection approach, cross-matching LAEs with extended Ly$\\alpha$ sources, yielding 89 LAB candidates. To obtain a more complete LAB sample, we introduce a new selection pipeline that models all galaxies detected in deep broadband imaging, subtracts them from the narrowband image, and then directly detects extended Ly$\\alpha$ emission. This method successfully identifies 23 additional low-surface-brightness LABs which could otherwise be missed by the conventional method. The number density of ODIN LABs near an ODIN protocluster ($n=7.5\\times10^{-5}$ cMpc$^{-3}$) is comparable to that found in the SSA22 proto-cluster and is four times higher than the average across the field. The cumulative Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity function within the protocluster regions is similar to that measured for the LABs in the SSA22 proto-cluster, suggesting a large excess of luminous LABs relative to the average field. These findings suggest the Ly$\\alpha$ luminosities and number densities of LABs are environment-dependent. ODIN will provide an expansive LAB and protocluster samples across six additional fields and two more redshifts, allowing us to investigate the nature of LABs in relation to their environments.",

        "abstract": "A deep understanding of the life-cycle of galaxies, particularly those of high mass, requires clarifying the mechanisms that regulate star formation (SF) and its abrupt shutdown (quenching), often capable of stopping SF rates of hundreds of solar masses per year. What initially triggers quenching, and what sustains the quiescent state thereafter, especially given the frequent presence of large gas reservoirs or even massive gas inflows, are unsolved key issues. Ultimately, the crucial connection between the galaxy life-cycle and the surrounding Intergalactic (IGM) and Circumgalactic (CGM) Medium remains largely unclear. Addressing these issues requires studying star formation, chemical enrichment, and quenching homogeneously up to high redshift. The upcoming AO-assisted Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), will deliver sharper and deeper data than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 mu) spectrograph designed to fully exploit the capabilities of ELT. Designed for multi-object slit spectroscopy and multi-Integral Field spectroscopy, SHARP points to achieve angular resolutions (~30 mas) far superior to NIRSpec at JWST(100 mas) to decipher and reconstruct the life-cycle oa galaxies.",

        "abstract": "Planet formation in the chemically ancient, dynamically heated Galactic thick disc remains poorly constrained, owing to the expectation that its low solid reservoirs, short disc lifetimes, and harsh irradiation environments inhibit efficient assembly of planetary bodies. However, an increasing number of confirmed thick disc planet hosts now challenge this view, indicating that planetary formation and survival in the early Milky Way may have been more resilient -- and more diverse -- than standard disc-evolution models suggest. Here we present a homogeneous characterisation of 38 exoplanetary systems orbiting bona fide thick disc stars, combining new detections with a systematic reassessment of archival systems. High-precision radial velocities and space-based transit photometry, combined with uniform high-resolution spectroscopy, yield self-consistent stellar and planetary parameters, and thick disc membership is secured via joint chemical and kinematic criteria. Among these systems, we identify two remarkably low-density, inflated planets -- TOI-1927 b and TOI-2643 b -- representing the first puffy planets known to orbit thick disc stars, and an outcome that is highly unexpected in metal-poor environments, thereby challenging current models of atmospheric retention and thermal inflation at low metallicity. This consolidated sample establishes a new empirical baseline for understanding how planetary architectures emerge under the depleted, short-lived discs characteristic of the early Milky Way.",

        "abstract": "Globular clusters (GCs), densely packed collections of thousands to millions of old stars, are excellent tracers of their host galaxies' evolutionary histories. Traditional methods for identifying GCs in galaxies rely on cuts over photometric catalogs and can yield source lists with high levels of contamination from compact background galaxies and foreground stars. In an era when large-scale sky surveys produce photometry for millions of sources, it is essential to employ flexible and scalable tools to reliably identify GCs in external galaxies. To prepare for surveys like Rubin/LSST, we need to explore practical methodological improvements and quantify the limitations inherent in the datasets. This paper investigates the selection of point-like extragalactic GCs exclusively in the $ugrizY$ color space. We use archival data to assemble an LSST-like photometric catalog for the Fornax Cluster containing labeled spectroscopically confirmed GCs, galaxies, and stars. From this catalog, using principal component analysis and non-linear auto-encoders (AEs), we construct inputs to random forest and multi-layer perceptron classifiers. We show that selecting GCs using ugrizY colors can lead to contamination rates of ~ 45%. If the principal components of the colors are used instead, this rate reduces to ~ 35% without increasing incompleteness. The AEs did not improve GC identification. To further reduce contamination and extract the full potential of LSST for star cluster studies, we argue for the need to augment photometric information with ancillary data (morphology from space-based missions and near-infrared photometry) before attempting to leverage more complex models.",

        "abstract": "We study the cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) of spin-3/2 particles during and after cosmic inflation, and map the parameter space that can realize the observed dark matter density in stable spin-3/2 particles. Originally formulated by Rarita and Schwinger, the relativistic theory of a massive spin-3/2 field later found a home in supergravity as the superpartner of the graviton, and in nuclear physics as baryonic resonances and nuclear isotopes. We study a minimal model realization, namely a free massive spin-3/2 field minimally coupled to gravity, and adopt the name raritron for this field. We demonstrate that CGPP of raritrons crucially depends on the hierarchy between the raritron mass $m_{3/2}$ and the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation $H_e$, with high-mass and low-mass cases distinguished by the evolution of the sound speed $c_s$ of the longitudinal (helicity-1/2) mode, which is approximately unity at all times for heavy (relative to Hubble) raritrons and can become small or vanish for lighter raritrons, leading to a dramatic enhancement of production of high momentum particles in the latter case. Assuming the raritrons are stable, this leads to a wide parameter space to produce the observed dark matter density. Finally, we consider a time-dependent raritron mass, which can be chosen to remove the vanishing sound speed of the longitudinal mode, but which nonetheless enhances the production relative to the constant high-mass case, and in particular does not necessarily tame the high momentum tail of the spectrum. We perform our calculations using the Bogoliubov formalism and compare, when applicable, to the Boltzmann formalism.",

        "abstract": "Free-streaming of cosmic neutrinos impacts the distribution and growth of cosmic structures on small scales, allowing constraints on the sum of neutrino masses $M_\\nu$ from clustering studies. In this work, we investigate for the first time the possibility of disentangling massive neutrino cosmologies with the 3-point correlation function (3PCF). We measure the isotropic connected 3PCF $\\zeta$ and the reduced 3PCF $Q$ of halo catalogues from the Quijote suite of N-body simulations, considering $M_\\nu =0.0, 0.1, 0.2,$ and $0.4 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$ in different redshift bins. We develop a framework to quantify the detectability of massive neutrinos for different triangle configurations and shapes, and apply it to a case compatible with a Stage-IV spectroscopic survey. We also compare our results with the analysis of simulations without neutrinos, but with different $\\sigma_8$ values, to test whether the 3PCF can break the well-known degeneracy between the two parameters. We find that, as a result of free-streaming, the largest signal is found for quasi-isosceles and squeezed triangles; this signal is increasing for decreasing redshifts. Among these configurations, elongated triangles, tracing the filamentary structure of the cosmic web, are the most affected by the impact of massive neutrinos, with a 3PCF signal increasing with $M_\\nu$. A complementary source of signal comes from right-angled triangles in $Q$. Importantly, we find that the signatures of a $\\sigma_8$ variation appear significantly different on elongated triangles in $\\zeta$ and right-angled triangles in $Q$, suggesting that the 3PCF can be used to effectively break the $M_\\nu - \\sigma_8$ degeneracy. These results open the possibility to use the 3PCF as a powerful complementary tool to constrain neutrino masses in current and future spectroscopic surveys like DESI, Euclid, 4MOST, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.",

        "abstract": "Ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories have transformed our view of compact-object mergers, yet their reach still limits a comprehensive reconstruction of the processes that generate these systems. Only next-generation observatories, with order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity and access to lower frequencies, will be capable of radically extending this detection horizon. GW observations will make it possible to detect the complete population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts of $z \\simeq 100$. This capability will deliver an unprecedented map of merger events across cosmic time and enable precise reconstruction of their mass and spin distributions, while for several thousand events the signal-to-noise ratio will surpass 100, enabling precision physics of BHs and neutron stars (NSs). The access to lower frequencies will also open the intermediate-mass window, detecting systems of order $\\sim 10^3 M_\\odot$, potentially in coordination with multi-band observations from LISA. At higher redshifts, where Population III stars have so far remained beyond reach - even for the James Webb Space Telescope - GW observations by next-generation detectors will routinely provide observations of BH mergers thought to originate from these primordial stellar populations. Such measurements are expected to play a central role in clarifying the early assembly of supermassive black holes. A single detection of a binary BH system at $z \\gtrsim 30$, or of a compact object with sub-solar mass and no tidal deformability, would constitute strong evidence for the existence of primordial black holes. Such a discovery would have profound consequences for our understanding of dark matter and the early Universe. Ultimately, the GW observations will become revolutionary for identifying the physical channels responsible for compact binary formation.",

Here we show that the prototypical young CCO 1E 1207.4-5209 is in fact a faint radio pulsar rotating at the 0.4s X-ray period. Analysis of its polarization indicates that the radio beam intersects our line of sight near the magnetic pole, affirming its radio faintness' being intrinsic. Once its supernova remnant dissipates, this source would be misidentified as an apparently gigayear-old pulsar. The CCO's low radio flux density may explain why many supernova remnants lack detectable radio pulsars and suggests a hidden population of young, slowly rotating neutron stars.",

This scanning enables efficient, large-area sky surveys by continuously scanning the MeerKAT array back and forth at fixed elevation while recording data at 2 sec intervals, progressively covering the survey region as the Earth rotates. We employ a novel on-the-fly (OTF) interferometric imaging technique to construct continuum images and catalogs from 16 hours of scan data. These data products, constituting the first MeerKLASS L-band data release (DR1), consist of high-fidelity radio continuum images and a catalogue of 34,874 radio sources detected with a SNR$>$9. The resulting Stokes I images achieve a median noise level of 33 $\\mu$Jy\\,beam$^{-1}$ and a median angular resolution of approximately $25.5''\\times 7.8''$. Cross-comparisons with previous surveys confirm the consistency of our flux density scale within 5\\% and astrometric precision within $1.5''$. Additionally, flux densities measured across the seven sub-bands enable in-band spectral-index estimates for the detected sources, providing insights into their physical properties and the broader source population. We compute the differential source counts, finding good agreement with existing measurements and validating our end-to-end processing. This data release demonstrates the effectiveness of scanning surveys when combined with OTF interferometric imaging. Commensal intensity mapping and interferometric imaging offers a dramatic enhancement of survey science per invested hour of observations and could therefore be an appealing option for next generation facilities like SKA-Mid.",

        "abstract": "The exteriors of stellar and galactic dynamos are usually modeled as a current-free potential field. A more realistic description might be that of a force-free magnetic field. Here, we suggest that, in the absence of outflows, neither of those reflect the actual behavior when the magnetic field spreads diffusively into a more poorly conducting turbulent exterior outside dynamo. In particular, we show that the usual ordering of the dipole magnetic field being the most slowly decaying one is altered, and that the quadrupole can develop a toroidal component that decays even more slowly with radial distance. This behavior is best seen for spherical dynamo volumes and becomes more complicated for oblate ones. In either case, however, those fields are confined within a magnetosphere beyond which the field drops exponentially. The magnetosphere expands ballistically (i.e., linearly in time $t$) during the exponential growth phase of the dynamo, but diffusively proportional to $t^{1/2}$ during the saturated phase. We demonstrate that the Faraday displacement current, which plays a role in a vacuum, can safely be neglected in all cases. For quadrupolar configurations, the synchrotron emission from the magnetosphere is found to be constant along concentric rings. The total and the polarized radio emissions from the dipolar or the quadrupolar configurations display large scale radial trends that are potentially distinguishable with existing radio telescopes. The superposition of magnetic fields from galaxies in the outskirts of the voids between galaxy clusters can therefore not explain the void magnetization of the intergalactic medium, reinforcing the conventional expectation that those fields are of primordial origin.",

        "abstract": "A known problem in cosmic shear two-point statistics is the apparent inconsistency between analyses performed in harmonic space (power spectrum) and real space (angular correlation). This arises mainly from two factors: first, scale cuts in one space correspond to soft cuts in the other, as the relationship between the two spaces is mediated by Bessel functions. For the same reason, astrophysical effects that are compact in one space may not be in the other, which can lead to biased parameter estimates. In this paper, we argue that these two statistics are complementary: we expect a robust theory to provide consistent constraints regardless of the chosen scale cuts. We present the consequences of pushing our analysis to smaller scales in both spaces, accounting for different models of Intrinsic Alignment and Baryonic Feedback in HSC Y3 data: we find that the harmonic-space analysis is significantly less sensitive to the specific modeling of small-scale physics, with model-choice-driven biases in $S_8$ being 2-3 times smaller than in real space. We show that using a flexible, simulation-based emulator for baryonic feedback (BACCO) in combination with the TATT model for intrinsic alignments provides the most consistent cosmological constraints between the two spaces when pushing to the smallest scales. In contrast, the standard HMCode-2016 model results in a $\\sim 1.1\\sigma$ tension between the two statistics. While harmonic space appears more robust for cosmological inference given current model uncertainties, real-space analyses offer a clearer separation of baryonic effects and will play a crucial role in distinguishing between baryonic feedback models in upcoming surveys.",

        "abstract": "GW231123 appears as the most massive binary black hole (BBH) ever observed by the LIGO interferometers with total mass $190-265 M_\\odot$. A high observed mass can be explained by the combination of cosmological redshift and gravitational magnification if the source is aligned with a gravitational lens, such as a galaxy. Small-scale objects such as stars and remnants diffract the signal, distorting the wavefront and providing additional lensing signatures. Here we present an analysis of GW231123 combining for the first time the effects of diffraction by a small-scale lens and gravitational magnification by an external potential, modelled as an embedded point-mass lens (PL), finding an intriguing case for the lensing hypothesis. Lensing is favoured by the data, with a false alarm probability of the observed Bayes factors bounded below $<1\\%$, or $\\sim 2.6 \\sigma$ confidence level. Including lensing lowers the total source mass of GW231123 to $100-180 M_\\odot$, closer to BBHs reported so far, and also removes discrepancies between different waveform approximants and the need for high component spins. We reconstruct all source and lens properties, including the microlens mass $190-850 M_\\odot$, its offset, the magnitude of the external gravitational potential and its orientation. The embedded PL analysis leads to a lighter microlens compared to the isolated PL. Within our assumptions, the reconstruction is complete up to an ambiguity between the distance and projected density (mass-sheet degeneracy). Assuming a single galaxy as the macroscopic lens allows us to infer the total amplification of the signal, placing the event at redshift $0.7-2$, and predict the probability $~55\\%$ of forming an additional detectable image due to strong lensing by the macrolens. We discuss the implications of our findings on the source and nature of the microlens, including a possible dark matter origin.",

We revisit the analytic PyWFS diffraction model to claim two aspects: i) that we can reconstruct spatial frequencies beyond the natural Shannon-Nyquist frequency imposed by the detector pixel size and/or ii) that the PyWFS can be used to measure amplitude aberrations (at the origin of scintillation). SR offers the possibility to control a higher actuator density deformable mirror from seemingly fewer samples, the quantification of which is one of the goals of this paper. A super-resolved PyWFS is more resilient to mis-registration, lifts alignment requirements and improves performance (against aliasing and other spurious modes AO systems are poorly sensitive to) with only a factor up to 2 increased real-time computational burden.",

While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter.",

Suspected to be the deflagrations of white dwarfs, they directly link the final stages of low-mass binary star evolution to extragalactic studies that are critical for cosmology. The ability to detect and study uTSNe is limited by the lack of high spatial resolution (10'x10') imaging capabilities in the optical, as well as large-scale segmented-telescope spectroscopic abilities that allow highly dynamic time-critical spectroscopy of short-duration transient events. Neither capability is currently foreseen for the European Southern Observatory and is therefore an excellent candidate for the Expanding Horizons program.",

This class of models is weakly constrained by CMB observations and can exhibit distinctive late-time suppression of structure growth. We derive constraints on cosmological, DS, and CPL parameters using three two-point correlation functions from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data, combined with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from DESI, Type Ia supernovae from DES Year 5, and CMB data from Planck. We find the dark-sector interaction parameter $A_\\mathrm{ds}$ to be consistent with zero for all data combinations, and that CPL provides a statistically preferred fit over DS for the selected probes. From the full data combination we obtain $w_0=-0.76\\pm0.06, \\, w_a=-0.77^{+0.23}_{-0.20}$ for CPL, and $w_0=-0.79^{+0.05}_{-0.06}, \\, w_a=-0.56^{+0.24}_{-0.15}, \\, (A_\\mathrm{ds}=9.8^{+2.8}_{-9.5}\\,\\mathrm{bn/GeV} )$ for DS. The inclusion of DES photometric information improves the Figure-of-Merit on $(w_0,w_a)$ by $\\sim$20% for CPL and $\\sim$50% for DS relative to DESI+SN+CMB alone. We find no evidence for an $S_8$ discrepancy in either model. These results provide the most stringent pre-Euclid constraints on DS from a combined photometric and spectroscopic analysis.",

        "abstract": "The proliferation of high time-resolution and decades-long monitoring of classical T Tauri stars provides a vast opportunity to test the variability of the star-disk connections. However, most monitoring surveys use single broad-band filters, which makes the conversion of photometric variability into accretion rate difficult. In this study, we analyze accretion bursts onto the nearby young star TW Hya over short (hours, days) and long (months, years) timescales by calibrating TESS and ASAS-SN $g$-band photometry to accretion rates with simultaneous spectroscopy. The high cadence TESS light curve shows bursts of accretion in clumps with masses from a sensitivity limit of $\\sim10^{-13}$~M$_\\odot$ up to $3\\times 10^{-11}$\\,M$_\\odot$. The average burst duration of 1.8 days is longer than a simple estimate of the thermal response timescale, supporting the interpretation that the photometric variability probes the instantaneous accretion rate. The reset timescale of 1.2--2 days derived from the structure function and previously reported quasi-periods of 3.5--4 days are consistent with bursts that may be related to the different rotation between the stellar magnetosphere and inner disk or with azimuthal asymmetries in the inner disk. The near-daily ASAS-SN light curve across 8 years reveals some seasonal changes in brightness with a standard deviation of $\\sim 0.13$ mag, about half of the scatter seen on short timescales. This study demonstrates the importance of coordinating contemporaneous multi-epoch spectroscopy with time domain surveys to interpret light curves of young stars.",

        "abstract": "Ultracompact Galactic binaries with orbital periods below an hour are among the strongest persistent gravitational-wave (GW) sources in the mHz band and will constitute the dominant population detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Tens of thousands are predicted to be individually resolved, with a substantial fraction bright enough for electromagnetic (EM) follow-up. This opens an unprecedented multi-messenger window on compact binary evolution, tidal interactions, mass transfer, and the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. We highlight key science enabled by joint GW + EM constraints and emphasize the critical need for rapid, high-cadence spectroscopic capabilities in the 2040s. In particular, the most compact (<10 min) binaries detected by LISA will require read-noise-free, zero-dead-time spectroscopic facilities, potentially realized through coordinated arrays of telescopes with time-staggered exposures, to measure radial velocities, tidal heating signatures, and orbital evolution with the precision needed for transformative multi-messenger studies.",

        "abstract": "Quasars (QSOs) emit an enormous amount of light as a result of the accretion of gas onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Thanks to their luminosity, the most distant known QSOs allow us to trace the growth of SMBHs deep into the epoch of reionisation. In this work, we employed $JWST$/NIRSpec observations of eight luminous (log$(L_{3000\\,A^{\\circ}}/(erg \\, s^{-1}))>$45.7) QSOs at $z\\geq$5.9 to constrain their accretion properties, namely black hole mass, accretion disc (AD) luminosity, and Eddington ratio ($M_{BH}$, $L_{AD}$, $\\lambda_{Edd}$), by fitting the rest-frame UV and optical emission with different AD models. This method provided self-consistent measurements of both $M_{BH}$ and $L_{AD}$. The uncertainties on $M_{BH}$ and $L_{AD}$, obtained within the AD-modelling framework ($\\sigma^{AD}_{M_{BH}}\\sim$0.2 dex; $\\sigma^{AD}_{L_{AD}}\\sim$0.1 dex), are significantly smaller than the systematic uncertainties associated with single-epoch $M_{BH}$ ($\\sim$0.4 dex) and $L_{AD}$ derived via bolometric corrections ($\\sim$0.2 dex). Based on these results, in our sample we found an average Eddington ratio of $\\langle \\log(\\lambda_{Edd}) \\rangle=-0.9$, with a dispersion of $\\sim$0.2 dex. Assuming that our high-z QSOs are representative of optically-selected bright blue QSOs, we derive a fraction of systems accreting above the Eddington limit of $\\sim$0.2%. In conclusion, this work i) demonstrates the suitability of $JWST$ to test AD models on high-redshift ($z\\gtrsim$4) QSOs, thanks to the large NIRSpec spectral coverage; ii) shows that AD modelling can yield robust $M_{\\rm BH}$ and $L_{\\rm AD}$ measurements, with smaller uncertainties than the typical calibrations; and iii) provides compelling evidence for sub-Eddington accretion in bright high-$z$ QSOs, challenging the widespread paradigm of near- or super-Eddington accretion occurring in these sources.",

        "abstract": "Gravitational wave oscillations arise from the exchange of energy between the metric perturbations and additional tensor modes. This phenomenon can occur even when the extra degrees of freedom consist of a triplet of massive Abelian vector fields, as in Multi-Proca dark energy models. In this work, we study gravitational wave oscillations in this class of models minimally coupled to gravity with a general potential, allowing also for a kinetic coupling between the vector field and dark matter that can, in principle, enhance the modulation of gravitational wave amplitudes. After consistently solving the background dynamics, requiring the model parameters to reproduce a phase of late-time accelerated expansion, we assess the accuracy of commonly used analytical approximations and quantify the impact of gravitational wave amplitude modulation for current detectors (LIGO--Virgo) and future missions such as LISA. Although oscillations are present in these scenarios, we find that the effective mass scale (the mixing mass) governing the phenomenon is $m_g \\sim \\mu_A$, where $\\mu_A$ is the (time-dependent) effective mass of the vector dark-energy field. Detectability of gravitational wave oscillations, however, requires $m_g \\gg H_0$, which is in tension with the ultra-light masses typically needed to drive accelerated expansion $\\mu_A \\sim H_0 \\sim 10^{-33}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. Therefore, if gravitational wave oscillations were to be detected at the corresponding frequencies, they could not be attributed to these classes of dark-energy models.",

MEGARA targets the southeastern (SE) filaments (3 kpc from the nucleus), coincident with the only known molecular gas clump, and the far eastern (FE) filament (15 kpc), spatially isolated within an old radio lobe. SITELLE fully maps the filaments, offering the first complete views of their kinematics and excitation. Combined with archival ALMA, MUSE and Chandra data, these observations offer a multi-phase view of gas dynamics. The filaments display complex motions inconsistent with simple rotation. Velocity structure functions (VSFs) of the warm and cold gas in the central and SE filaments show consistent steep slopes (2/3) and flattening on small scales of a few hundred parsecs, possibly suggesting energy injection from Type Ia supernovae, though interpretation is method-limited. The FE filament shows a lower VSF amplitude, suggesting less active driving. ALMA CO emission is co-spatial and kinematically aligned with the ionized gas, the latter showing broader velocity dispersions. Ionization diagnostics indicate AGN-related processes (e.g., shocks) dominate, with higher-energy excitation near the radio lobes and lower-energy fossil feedback signatures in the FE filament. Finally, the filaments follow the same strong H$\\alpha$-X-ray surface brightness correlation seen in other clusters, supporting local thermal coupling between phases. However, the FE filament deviates from this trend, possibly due to uplift from past AGN outbursts or limitations in the analysis method.",

        "abstract": "Characterizing the interior structure of exoplanets is an inverse problem often solved using Bayesian inference, but this approach is hampered by the high computational cost of planetary structure models. To overcome this barrier, we present a robust framework that accelerates inference by replacing the computationally expensive physics-based forward model with a fast polynomial chaos-Kriging (PCK) surrogate directly within a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling loop. We rigorously validate our approach using a suite of tests, including a direct comparison against a benchmark MCMC inference using the full forward model, and a large-scale coverage study with 1000 synthetic test cases to demonstrate the statistical reliability of our inferred credible intervals. Our surrogate-assisted framework achieves a computational speedup of over 2 orders of magnitude (factor of $\\sim$320), reducing single-CPU inference times from days to minutes. This efficiency is achieved with a surrogate that requires only a few hundred forward model evaluations for training \\rev{for a single planet}. This data efficiency provides significant flexibility for model developments and a clear advantage over common machine learning approaches, which typically demand vast training sets ($>10^6$ model runs) and intensive pre-computation. The PCK surrogate maintains high fidelity with $R^2 > 0.99$ for most scenarios, and root-mean-square errors typically an order of magnitude smaller than observational uncertainties. This efficiency enables large scale population studies while preserving statistical robustness, which is computationally impractical with traditional methods.",

        "abstract": "Superradiant instabilities of rotating black holes can give rise to long-lived bosonic clouds, offering natural laboratories to probe ultralight particles across a wide range of parameter space. The presence of a companion can dramatically impact both the cloud's evolution and the binary's orbital dynamics, generating a trail of feedback effects that require detailed modelling. Using a worldline effective field theory approach, we develop a systematic framework for binaries on generic (eccentric and inclined) orbits, capturing both resonant and non-resonant transitions without relying solely on balance laws. We demonstrate the existence of ``co-rotating'' floating orbits that can deplete the cloud prior to entering the detector's band, triggering eccentricity growth towards a sequence of fixed points. Likewise, we show that ``counter-rotating'' orbits can also deplete the cloud, driving (unbounded) growth of eccentricity. Furthermore, we uncover novel features tied to orbital inclination. Depending on the mass ratio, equatorial orbits can become unstable, and fixed points may arise not only for aligned or anti-aligned configurations but, strikingly, also at intermediate inclinations. We derive flow equations governing spin-orbit misalignment and eccentricity and identify distinctive signatures that can reveal the presence of boson clouds in the binary's history, as well as key features of possible in-band transitions. These results refine and extend earlier work, yielding a more faithful description of the imprints of ultralight particles in gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes, signatures that are within reach of future detectors such as LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and the Einstein~Telescope.",

In DR 21, we identified 13 compact radio sources (CRS), 9 located in the DR 21 core and near the CO streamer ejection region. The radio properties of the CRSs show that three are nonthermal radio emitters, likely magnetically active stars, while the nature of the remaining CRSs cannot be conclusively identified. All detected CRSs are good candidates for follow-up proper motion studies to confirm whether they are runaway stars. We also identify multiple ionized arc-shaped structures that can be fitted with parabolas whose symmetry axes converge to a position coincident with CRSs #11, raising the possibility that this source is the main ionizing star. A re-analysis of the 18 molecular outflow streamers refines the center of the explosive event, which aligns closely with the position indicated by the arcs convergence point, supporting a common stellar origin for the EMOs and the HII-region. In G5.89, the observations reveal a shell with a square-like morphology. The strong extended emission from this HII region prevents the detection of weak compact radio sources inside the shell; only two were identified well beyond the shell, and a single parabolic arc was fitted within this region. Overall, arc structures in ionized regions seem to be good tracers of the origin of the ionizing sources.",

A key diagnostic for their nature is the spiral arm pattern speed: the radial profile of the angular rotation rate of spiral features. This profile determines the location and number of dynamical resonances where peculiar motions and azimuthal metallicity fluctuations in stars and gas can manifest; their precise patterns have the potential to support or reject theories of spiral structure. However, limited observations of this type have been carried out so far, despite an increasing number of theoretical predictions emerging from realistic and detailed cosmological simulations. A systematic observational programme focussed on the resolved kinematics and metallicities of stellar populations around galaxy spiral arms is required to confront these predictions. This calls for wide-area multi-object spectrographs on 12m-class telescopes capable of accurately capturing such data across the full coverage of spiral arms in nearby galaxies.",

Despite the disclosure of a nearby pulsar and multiple studies in the high-energy (HE, E > 100 MeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) regimes, there have been no confirmed counterparts (e.g., an SNR shell or other extended structure) in X-ray or other wavelengths. We present the result of our study of the VHE emission of HESS~J1857+026 with VERITAS as part of a multi-wavelength investigation to uncover its emission mechanisms. Our result confirms the extended nature of the source and we characterize its spectral and morphological features in the VHE band.

        "abstract": "Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are fundamental to cosmology and galactic chemical evolution, yet the nature of their progenitor systems remains unresolved. Multiple evolutionary pathways, including single-degenerate, double-degenerate, and helium-donor systems, are thought to contribute to the SN Ia population, but direct observational constraints are limited. This uncertainty hampers our understanding of SN Ia diversity and introduces systematic uncertainties in their use as precision cosmological probes. By the 2040s, surveys such as Gaia, LSST, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and the gravitational-wave mission LISA will identify thousands of compact binaries in the Milky Way that are potential SN Ia progenitors. However, survey discoveries alone are insufficient. Robust identification and characterization require high-time-resolution, phase-resolved spectroscopy to determine fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital inclinations, chemical compositions, and accretion states. Addressing these challenges demands new observational capabilities. The most compact binaries require continuous, dead-time-free spectroscopy with negligible readout noise, while the progenitor population spans a wide range of brightness and orbital periods. A modular, multi-aperture telescope array equipped with fast, low-noise spectrographs can flexibly combine collecting area for faint targets, observe bright systems efficiently, and deliver uninterrupted time series through staggered exposures. Such observations are difficult for single-aperture facilities.",

Focusing on the case of scalar perturbations in single-field inflation, we model interactions using a Lindblad equation with a non-unitary contribution quadratic in the scalar perturbations, and of parametrisable amplitude and time dependence. We compute the quantum state of these interacting perturbations, which is fully described by its purity and squeezing parameters. First, we show that, in most of the parameter space, not only the purity but also the squeezing parameter is significantly reduced by interactions. Second, we show that this de-squeezing induced by the interactions, on top of the purity loss, causes a further suppression of quantum correlations. We thus emphasise that the quantum or classical character of the correlations exhibited by the perturbations cannot be correctly determined by computing the effect of interactions on the purity alone. Since the phenomenological framework adopted in this paper encompasses a wide class of possible interactions, our results provide general insights into the nature of decoherence processes in primordial fluctuations.",

In our proposed scenario, baryogenesis happens in three steps: (1) The decay of the scalar produces an asymmetry between the two Higgs doublets which is partly transferred to fermions via Standard Model processes. (2) This asymmetry is converted into a $B-L$ charge via interactions mediated by the Majorana fermion. (3) The weak sphaleron processes partially convert the resulting $B-L$ charge into a $B$ asymmetry. We perform a numerical analysis of baryogenesis and the EDM contributions and find that, due to resonant enhancement, baryogenesis is possible with singlet masses as low as $10^5$ GeV. We also find that for some parameters, the model can give large contributions to the electron and neutron EDM while also producing baryogenesis. The present scenario offers a new perspective on interpreting observational bounds in terms of cosmology: Because it relies on out-of-equilibrium decays, the questions of baryogenesis and $CP$ violation in the Higgs sector may be linked with EDM signals without the additional assumption of a first order electroweak phase transition.",

        "abstract": "The recently discovered gravitational wave event GW231123 was interpreted as the merger of two black holes with a total mass of 190-265 $M_\\odot$, making it the heaviest such merger detected to date. Whilst much of the post-discovery literature has focused on its astrophysical origins, primary analyses have exhibited considerable discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models, which cannot reliably be reproduced by simulations. Such discrepancies may arise when an unaccounted overlapping signal is present in the data, or from phenomena that produce similar effects, such as gravitational lensing or overlapping noise artifacts. In this work, we analyse GW231123 using a flexible model that allows for two overlapping signals, and find that it is favoured over the isolated signal model with Bayes factors of $\\sim 10^2 - 10^{4}$, depending on the waveform model. These values lie within the top few per cent of the background distribution. Similar effects are not observed in GW190521, another high-mass event. Under the overlapping signals model, discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models are largely mitigated, and the two recovered sources show similar properties. Additionally, we find that neglecting an additional signal in overlapping-signal data can lead to discrepancies in the estimated source properties resembling those reported in GW231123.",

A generic feature of leptogenesis is a large separation of scales between the epoch of baryon asymmetry production (sphaleron freeze-out at temperature $T \\sim 130$ GeV) and the one where it affects the big bang nucleosynthesis processes (BBN at $T \\sim 1$ MeV). Any entropy release between these two epochs would lead to a dilution of previously produced relics, such as the baryons. Motivated by the recent evidence of a stochastic gravitational waves background (SGWB) in the nHz frequency range, we consider the case of supercooled first-order phase transition and we study the impact of the induced entropy dilution on the leptogenesis parameter space. We employ the Type-I seesaw with 2 right-handed neutrinos as benchmark scenario, and demonstrate that the viable leptogenesis parameter space is significantly reduced. Interestingly, the values of dilution predicted by the SGWB best fit points in several first order phase transition scenarios would completely exclude the leptogenesis parameter space testable by future experiments, thus establishing a phenomenological interconnection between leptogenesis, SGWB, first order phase transition and neutrino mass generation. Our analysis can be generalised to different leptogenesis models and entropy dilution mechanisms.",

A general technique to compute ensemble averages is provided. Path-integral methods are developed to study thermal Green's functions (with an arbitrary number of points) in generic interacting fermion-scalar theories, which cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalism. These general results are applied to physical situations typical of neutron stars, which are often quickly rotating: the Fermi surface and Fermi momentum, the average energy, number density and angular momentum for degenerate fermions and particle production (such as neutrino production from rotating neutron stars, e.g. pulsars). In particular, it is shown that the neutrino production rate due to the direct URCA (DU) processes grows indefinitely as the angular velocity approaches the inverse linear size of the plasma and, therefore, rotation can significantly increase this rate.",

Solving all components of Einstein's equations, Maxwell's equations, ideal MHD equations, and force-free conditions, equilibriums of rotating compact stars associated with mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields are obtained. It is found that in the extreme cases the strong mixed magnetic fields concentrating in a toroidal region near the equatorial surface expel the matter and form a force-free toroidal magnetotunnel. We also introduce a new differential rotation law for computing solutions associated with force-free magnetosphere, and present other extreme models without the magnetotunnel.",

Astrophys., 667, 48, 2022) argued and made a compelling case that classical astronomical adaptive optics (AO) tomography performance can be further enhanced by carefully designing and optically configuring the system to leverage inherent super-resolution (SR) capabilities. Our goal here is to further materialise the concept by providing the means to compute SR-enabling tomographic reconstructors for AO and showcase its broad uptake on soon every 10 m-class VIS/NIR telescopes and Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes of up to 40 m in diameter. To that end we indicate the necessary tomography generalisations where we: (i) clarify how model-and-deploy is a generic methodological umbrella for linear minimum-mean-squared-error (LMMSE) tomographic reconstructors arising naturally from the solution of the tomographic inverse problem, thus unifying various solutions presented as distinct in the literature within a single framework, (ii) recall how such solutions are found as limiting cases of a model-based optimal control problem, thus elucidating how pseudo-open-loop control is a feature of the latter that allows LMMSE reconstructors to be adapted to closed-loop systems, (iii) review the two forms of the LMMSE tomographic reconstructors, highlighting the necessary adaptations to accommodate super-resolution, (iv) review the implementation in either dense-format vector-matrix-multiplication or sparse iterative forms and (v) discuss the implications for runtime and off-line real-time implementations, anticipating widespread adoption. We illustrate our examples with physical-optics numerical simulations for 10 m and 40 m-scale systems showing the performance benefits of super-resolution in the order of several tens of nm rms and the computational burden associated.",

We compare our findings to other work and find that while other studies are generally in line with our findings, they do not cover the entire space of solutions faithfully. Furthermore, we present guidance for modellers that construct Uranus or Neptune interior models with a fixed number of layers. We provide a statistical relation between the steepness classifying a density discontinuity and the resulting number of discontinuities to be expected. For example, if one classifies a discontinuity as a density gradient larger than 0.02 kg m$^{-4}$, then most solutions should have at most one such discontinuity. Finally, we find that discontinuities, if present, are concentrated around a planetary normalised radius of 0.65 for Uranus and 0.7 for Neptune.

Various assumed decay modes of the hypothetical resonance have different effects on the direction and shape of the modified average shower depth as function of the energy, with possible implications for current or future measurements.

In Starobinsky's seminal work and most of the subsequent literature, stochastic inflation is driven by a white noise. This is a consequence of a number of assumptions about the background metric, the window function, and the initial state. Given that noise is the central object in this approach, it is worthwhile to investigate how the noise is modified upon relaxing some of these assumptions. We show that while deviation from an exact de Sitter background maintains the white character of the noise (only with a time-dependent amplitude), deviation from the Heaviside window function or the Bunch-Davies initial state can produce colored noise. We calculate the power spectrum and the memory of the noise for a toy model with a piecewise linear window function. We also show that, in order to produce a colored noise, the deviation from the Bunch-Davies vacuum should essentially be a sum of two-particle states. The resulting noise is non-stationary and we find its instantaneous power spectrum in a concrete example. Furthermore, while deviations from de Sitter background and sharp cutoff do not affect Gaussianity, changing the initial state yields a non-Gaussian noise.",

We find that it is impossible to identify a loop as a simple coherent magnetic flux tube that coincides with plasma of nearly uniform temperature and density. The location of bright structures is determined by a complex interplay between heating, cooling and evaporation timescales. Current sheets form preferentially at the interfaces of magnetic flux from different sources. They may also form within bundles of magnetic field lines since motions within magnetic concentrations drive plasma flows on a range of timescales that provide further substructure and can locally enhance magnetic field gradients and thus facilitate magnetic reconnection. The numerical experiment therefore possesses aspects of both the flux tube tectonics and flux braiding models. While modelling an observed coronal loop as a cylindrical flux tube is useful to understand the physics of specific heating mechanisms in isolation, it does not describe well the structure of a coronal loop rooted in a self-consistently evolving convection zone.",

        "abstract": "The unprecedented volume of data from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescopes will require the implementation of robust and solid strategies for efficient data processing and management. In this context, the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet) -- a collaborative global infrastructure comprising multiple regional centres distributed across various geographical regions around the globe -- is poised to play a critical role. This network will be instrumental in facilitating the effective handling and analysis of extensive data streams generated by the telescopes, thereby enabling significant advancements in astronomical research and exploration. This paper introduces a semantic model implemented with JSON-LD designed specifically for the SRCNet, detailing its architecture, data distribution, and computing service. By explicitly defining nodes, resources, relationships, and workflows, this model lays a foundation for interoperability and efficient resource management within the distributed network. The model presented in this text supports two possible configurations: centralized and decentralized -- depending where data reside -- enabling a future service broker to efficiently plan workflows by querying nodes for real-time system availability. Consistency tests conducted using SPARQL queries were made on the model in order to validate and test its integrity. Therefore, this research contributes to the advancement of semantic modeling in astronomy by addressing the semantic model for the SRCNet, a topic that has not been previously explored. This semantic model serves as a precursor to the development of a precise mathematical representation of the network and establishes a foundational framework for a future service broker.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the accretion dynamics and test particle motion around a non-rotating, spherically symmetric Lee-Wick black hole (BH) to reveal how the model parameters affect orbital stability and the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in X-ray binary systems. The spacetime geometry, characterized by the BH mass and the coupling parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$, includes exponential and oscillatory corrections arising from the Lee-Wick terms. Using the effective potential approach, we derive specific energy, angular momentum, epicyclic frequencies, and the locations of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of test particles. In addition to the analytical analysis, we explore the effects of the Lee-Wick spacetime parameters on the shock-cone morphology produced by Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion. To this end, we perform general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations in two characteristic regimes: Block-1 (weak Lee-Wick regime) and Block-2 (strong Lee-Wick regime). The results show that Block-1 solutions closely resemble the Schwarzschild case, while Block-2 models develop denser and asymmetric shock cones accompanied by stronger QPOs activity, shifting from low-frequency to high-frequency QPOs. These variations yield distinct observational signatures that may be detectable in high-resolution X-ray timing data. Our analytical and numerical findings demonstrate that the Lee-Wick parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$ cause measurable changes in the morphology of the accretion flow and in the frequency ratios near the BH. This suggests that future multi-wavelength observations could provide an important avenue to test higher-derivative gravity theories.",

In this paper, in the format of space-based GW detectors, we establish an analytical framework to systematically search for the coupling of various noises from the heterodyne and modulation frequency bands, which are relatively unexplored so far. In addition to the noise caused by the phase modulation, the high-frequency laser phase noise is also discussed in the same framework. The analytical result is also compared with a numerical experiment to confirm that our framework successfully captures the major noise couplings. We also demonstrate a use case of this study by taking the LISA-like parameters as an example, which enables us to derive requirements on the level of the laser and phase modulation noises in the high frequency regimes.",

Presently, the empirical correlation lacks sufficient precision to confidently convert these timescales into black hole masses, especially at the low-mass end. To find more AGNs with timescale measurements, we study a very large catalog of AGNs from the Gaia Data Release 3 called GLEAN (Gaia variabLE AgN; 872228 objects). We identify GLEAN objects with optical spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR17 and light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) DR21. After fitting the light curves with a damped random walk model, we find that the GLEAN light curves have insufficient sampling to extract reliable amplitude and timescale measurements outside the range of 50-100 days. On the other hand, well-sampled ZTF light curves allow more accurate estimations of these parameters. The fractional variability amplitude is an effective, model-independent metric for measuring variability amplitude, but only when derived from high-quality light curves. We provide a catalog of 127 GLEAN AGNs with spectroscopic virial black hole masses, and variability amplitudes and timescales. Though we do not find any low-mass black holes in this AGN sample, we confirm a relationship between the damped random walk timescale and the black hole mass that is consistent with previous studies.",

Quantifying how frequently such nesting occurs is important for understanding the organisation and recurrence of solar magnetic fields. We introduce an automated approach to identify nests in the longitude-time domain and to measure the fraction of sunspot groups that belong to them. The method combines a smooth representation of emergence patterns with a density-based clustering procedure, validated using synthetic solar-like cycles and corrected for variations in data density. We apply this method to 151 years of sunspot-group observations from the Royal Greenwich Observatory Photoheliographic Results (RGO, 1874-1976) and Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station (KMAS, 1955-2025) catalogues. Across all cycles and latitude bands, the mean nesting degree is $\\langle D\\rangle = 0.61 \\pm 0.12$, implying that about 60 percent all sunspot groups emerge within nests. Nesting is strongest at mid-latitudes (10$^\\circ$-20$^\\circ$), and results from the two independent datasets agree in the period of overlap. The identified nests range from compact clusters to long-lived, drifting structures, offering new quantitative constraints on the persistence and organisation of solar magnetic activity.",

Cycle 25 is now entering its declining phase, the critical period during which most of the cycle's polar fields are established. Therefore, reliable polar-field prediction is now especially important. Polar-field evolution is governed by the poleward transport of already-emerged active-region (AR) flux over a timescale of a few years. Thus, surface flux-transport models can reliably provide one-year predictions without requiring information about future AR emergence. Our prediction method is validated using simulations of the surface magnetic field from 2020-2025 and hindcasts of the 2023-2024 polar fields, employing a newly constrained profile of the meridional flow. Using the most recent HMI synoptic magnetogram as the initial condition, we predict the polar-field evolution from October 2025 to October 2026. The southern polar field is predicted to strengthen gradually, while the northern field is expected to decline sharply until March 2026 due to some ARs with abnormal polarity. By that time, the northern polar field becomes exceptionally weak, and the southern field remains relatively weak, raising concerns about the polar-field strength at the cycle 25/26 minimum and the amplitude of cycle 26.",

Naturally, such instrumental improvements open up possibilities for new and interesting scientific studies. We aim to show that the study of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) in particular is bound to profit from these high-resolution measurements. This is because PWNe are the dominant Galactic source population at TeV energies, exhibit hard spectra up to hundreds of TeV and from X-ray observations are known to possess plentiful structure on arcminute scales. Using HESS J1813-178 and MSH 15-52 as examples, we create simple leptonic models of the TeV morphology of these sources based on X-ray observations and existing gamma-ray measurements. Then, assuming different models for the exposure and point spread function of the observatory, we create mock observations with the future CTAO southern array. We use these to assess the ability of these observations to differentiate between models and study the physics of these sources, in particular to infer the structure of the magnetic field and electron distributions. We find that future observations with the CTAO southern array at multi-TeV energies - in combination with existing X-ray measurements - will likely be able to constrain the distributions of magnetic field and high-energy electrons in these sources. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of these measurements can be significantly enhanced with the improved angular resolution achievable with novel reconstruction algorithms. However, we also show that in the relevant multi-TeV regime, signal-photon statistics remain a limitation and trading event statistics for improved angular resolution is not necessarily advantageous.",

This revisited horizon entropy is constructed directly from the modified Friedmann equations in a non-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. The resulting entropy relation contains, beside the standard Bekenstein-Hawking term, an additional integral contribution that encodes the effective energy density and pressure generated by deviations from general relativity. Using this universal entropy formula, a compact expression for the GSL is derived. This formalism is then applied to some viable $f(T)$ and $f(R)$ gravity models, in order to re-evaluate the validity of the GSL as a function of redshift. The analysis demonstrates that including the integral term in the revisited entropy can relatively improve the late-time validity of the GSL for some of these models while living others unchanged, thereby reinforcing the profound connection between thermodynamics and gravity.",

        "abstract": "We explore the possibility of parity-violating, nonminimally coupled 2-form field theories that retain the same dynamical degrees of freedom as a massive 2-form and thus are ghost-free. Starting from the most general kinetic terms and dimension four couplings between the 2-form field and the curvature tensors, we find a two-parameter family of such theories. However, we also find that parity-violating terms involving the dual 2-form field can be absorbed into a field redefinition, leaving a theory with essentially the same structure as that obtained by Heisenberg and Trenkler (i.e., the parity-preserving coupling to the double dual Riemann tensor). After the field redefinition, the only place where parity-violating terms can appear is in the potential. We then consider a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with an isotropic configuration of a triplet of 2-form fields, and study tensor perturbations in this setup. There are three types of tensor perturbations, two of which are dynamical. We show that chiral gravitational waves can be generated in the presence of parity-violating terms in the potential.",

        "abstract": "We present constraints on the nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB) using X-ray pulsar timing data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer(\\textit{NICER}). By analyzing six millisecond pulsars over a six-year observational baseline, we employed a Bayesian framework to model noise components and search for a common red signal consistent with a GWB from supermassive black hole binaries (assuming a spectral index $\\gamma_{\\rm gwb}=13/3$). Our results show no significant evidence for a GWB, yielding a 95\\% upper limit of $\\log_{10}(A_{\\rm gwb})<-13.4$. Weak evidence for Hellings-Downs spatial correlations was found (S=2.5), though the signal remains statistically inconclusive. Compared to radio and $\\gamma$-ray pulsar timing arrays, the \\textit{NICER} constraint is currently less stringent but demonstrates the feasibility of X-ray timing with \\textit{NICER} for GWB studies and highlights the potential for improved sensitivity with future X-ray missions.",

        "abstract": "The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed a diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos for more than a decade. A relevant background to the astrophysical flux is prompt atmospheric neutrinos, originating from the decay of charmed mesons produced in cosmic-ray-induced air showers. The production rate of charmed mesons in the very forward phase space of hadronic interactions, and consequently, the prompt neutrino flux, remains uncertain and has not yet been observed by neutrino detectors. An accurate measurement of this flux would enhance our understanding of fundamental particle physics such as hadronic interactions in high-energy cosmic-ray-induced air showers and the nucleon structure. Furthermore, an experimental characterization of this background flux will improve the precision of astrophysical neutrino flux spectral measurements. In this work, we perform a combined fit of cascade-like and track-like neutrino events in IceCube to constrain the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux. Given that the prompt flux is a sub-dominant contribution, treating systematic uncertainties arising from the potential mis-modeling of the conventional and astrophysical neutrino fluxes is critical for its measurement. Our analysis yields a non-zero best-fit result, which is, however, consistent with the null hypothesis of no prompt flux within one standard deviation. Consequently, we establish an upper bound on the flux at $4\\times 10^{-16}$ (GeV m$^2$ s sr)$^{-1}$ at 10 TeV.",

        "abstract": "We present a spectroscopic analysis of XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of the 'complex' NLS1 PG 1535+547 at redshift $z=0.038$. These observations span three epochs: 2002 and 2006 with XMM-Newton alone, covering the $0.3-10$ keV energy range, and a coordinated XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observation in 2016, covering the $0.3-60$ keV energy range. The X-ray spectra across all epochs exhibit both neutral and ionized absorption, along with reflection features from the accretion disc, including a prominent Compton hump in the broadband data. Notably, the spectral shape varies across epochs. Our analysis suggests this variability is attributed to changes in both line-of-sight absorption and the intrinsic emission from PG 1535+547. The source is obscured by multiple layers of partially and/or fully covering neutral and ionized absorbers, with neutral column densities ranging from undetectable levels in the least obscured phase to $\\sim0.3-5\\times10^{23}\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ in the most obscured phase. A clear warm absorber is revealed during the least obscured phase. The continuum remains fairly consistent ($\\Gamma\\approx 2.2\\pm0.1$) during the first two observations, followed by a substantial flux decrease (by a factor of $\\sim7$ in the $2-10$ keV band) in 2016 compared to 2006. The 2016 data indicates the source is in a reflection-dominated state during this epoch, with a reflection fraction of $R>7$ and an X-ray source located at a height $\\leq 1.72r_g$. Simultaneous fitting of the multi-epoch data suggests a rapidly rotating black hole with a spin parameter, $a>0.99$. These findings imply that strong light-bending effects may account for the observed continuum flux reduction.",

        "abstract": "Large Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations (e.g., Starlink and Iridium) significantly increase the likelihood of transient, high-power interference events at ground receivers. This report presents SatTrack, a GUI-driven simulation framework that (i) tracks satellite motion relative to a fixed antenna boresight, (ii) predicts reflector gain patterns of a parabolic reflector antenna with a reconfigurable rim of specified size using a physical optics (PO) surface-current model decomposed into fixed and reconfigurable rim regions, and (iii) synthesizes deep, directional nulls using fast rim-weight optimization algorithms. Beyond baseline serial greedy and greedy bit-flip methods, additional files support advanced weight optimization algorithms including simulated annealing and majorization-minimization operating over higher-order complex weight alphabets, enabling deeper null formation. Interference power from satellites is estimated using free-space path loss and an FCC-derived Starlink EIRP versus steering-angle model, and event-level throughput for each satellite is computed using Shannon capacity. Results show simple binary rim control achieves about 40-55 dB of average interference suppression, while advanced optimization methods can exceed 65-70 dB under favorable geometries, with best-case received interference below -220 dBm. We compare no mitigation, satellite muting, and rim-based spatial nulling, showing rim-based nulling approaches muting-level suppression while preserving throughput close to the no-mitigation case. These results highlight both the scalability of rim-based reflector reconfiguration and the fundamental limitation when satellites cross the main lobe.",

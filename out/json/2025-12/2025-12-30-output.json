        "abstract": "Profiles of galaxy's rotation velocity (rotation curves) remain unexpectedly flat at large distances, where visible matter alone should make the rotation speed decrease with radius. The usual explanation requires large amounts of unseen dark matter. Here, we introduce an empirical law in which spacetime itself appears to store additional energy when distorted by baryonic matter. The baryonic potential $\\Phi_b$ made by the baryonic energy density $\\rho_b$ generates an additional energy density $\\rho_s = \\mu_s \\Phi_b^2 / c^4$, leading to a Poisson equation for the total potential $\\Phi_{\\rm tot}$, \\[ \\nabla^2\\Phi_{\\rm tot} = 4\\pi G\\,\\rho_b /c^2 + 4\\pi G\\,\\mu_s\\,\\Phi_b^2 / c^6. \\] When assuming $\\mu_s = K M_b^{-3/2}$ with a parameter $K$, we applied this equation to 91 galaxies from the SPARC database. The model reproduced quite well both the inner rise and outer flat regions of the observed rotation curves using the observed baryonic mass profiles only. The $K$ values for the 91 galaxies were found to be concentrated within a narrow range. These results suggest that dark matter is directly connected to the baryonic gravitational potential. A theoretical interpretation of the empirical law is also discussed, in which a relation between the additional energy and the cosmological constant is implied.",

We simulate the evolution of a 15 M$_\\odot$ Pop III star from the zero-age main sequence through to core collapse, while varying the $^{16}$O($^{16}$O, n)$^{31}$S reaction rate by factors of 0.1, 1, and 10. Our results demonstrate that increasing this reaction rate prompts earlier onset and extended duration of core oxygen burning at lower temperatures and densities. A higher reaction rate also increases neutron excess in OSi-rich layers, thereby promoting the synthesis of neutron-rich isotopes, particularly $^{31}$P and $^{39}$K. Most notably, the K yield is enhanced by a factor of 6.4. For a tenfold enhancement of the $^{16}$O($^{16}$O, n)$^{31}$S rate, the predicted [K/Ca] and [K/Fe] values from presupernova models reach 0.29 and 0.22 dex, respectively-values that are consistent with the most recent observational data for extremely metal-poor stars. These findings hold promise as a potential new solution to the problem of potassium underproduction and offer a valuable theoretical reference and motivation for subsequent measurements of oxygen fusion reaction rate.",

We aim to understand the effect of faculae-like field strengths on near-surface stellar convection using 3D radiative MHD simulations of near-surface magneto-convection. We compare simulations of F, G, K and M main-sequence stars with a small-scale dynamo (SSD) to faculae-like spatially averaged field strengths (from 100 to 500 G). We focus on the effect of imposed magnetic field on the thermodynamic stratification and velocities, along with the bolometric intensity and surface field strength. Imposed magnetic fields result in reduced average density and gas pressure near the surface compared to the SSD simulations. The temperature stratification also shows a dip at and just below the stellar surface. The changes in average bolometric intensity are within a percent, with different trends with field strength for different stellar types. In addition, the convective velocities are reduced. The magnitude of changes in thermodynamic quantities are related to field strength as well as the stellar $T_{\\rm eff}$. Faculae-strength magnetic fields modify the near surface convection by reducing gas pressure and density as well as suppressing convection in regions with strong field concentrations. The strength of these effects depends on the stellar type.",

        "abstract": "We study the impact of heavy dark matter (DM) captured in massive stars via scattering(s) with the star constituents. We focus on the first stars and use stellar evolution simulations to track down how DM capture evolves over time from the zero-age main sequence to the late metal-rich stages of stellar evolution. During the early hydrogen-helium-dominated phase, the capture process is well described by scattering with two targets. As a star evolves, metal production leads to the formation of a dense core surrounded by a lighter envelope. The core significantly enhances the capture of ultra-heavy DM; in this case, three distinct nuclear species are required to accurately describe multiple-scattering capture. We use the Eddington inversion method to obtain a realistic DM velocity distribution, better suited when the star is near the center of a halo, than the widely used Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We find that heavy DM would be able to thermalize and achieve capture-annihilation equilibrium within a massive star's lifetime for regions of the parameter space not excluded by direct detection. For non-annihilating DM, because of the high amount of targets available for capture and despite massive stars being short-lived, it would even be possible for DM to achieve self-gravitation and collapse to a black hole, which eventually could swallow the star from within before the expected end of the star's life, for non-excluded regions of the parameter space. Our results highlight the dependence of DM capture on the stellar evolutionary stage, composition, and halo location, demonstrating that accurate modeling of massive stars is essential for constraining heavy DM with primordial stellar populations.",

Using two recent large LAMOST catalogues of field, low-mass giant stars (both Li-rich and Li-poor) with metallicities from -4.0 to -1.0, we studied the conditions for Li enrichment and the distribution of stellar rotations in the Galactic halo and thick disc. Due to the scarcity of stars with [Fe/H]  -2.5. Among these stars, we detected IR excesses indicative of giant stars losing mass, showing a recent episodic Li-enrichment process related to the Cameron-Fowler mechanism for the formation of new 7Li. Because stars with IR excesses are distributed across most metallicity values, we suggest this mechanism is at work throughout an important part of the Galaxy's evolutionary history. Based on these IR excesses, we identified three Li thresholds: about 1.5 dex for RGB stars, about 0.5 dex for HB stars, and about -0.5 dex for AGB stars, establishing a new criterion to characterise Li-rich giants. We carried out a study of stellar rotations in metal-poor giant stars, revealing that a plateau appears for velocities greater than 40 km/s up to near 90 km/s, with Li abundances from 1.02 to 1.82 dex. Among Li-rich giants with v sin i > 40 km/s, increasing rotation is observed as metallicity decreases from -1.0 to -2.5. The presence of RGB and HB Li-rich giants with rotations up to 90 km/s suggests that stellar models must account for extended 3He reservoir lifetimes as a source of 7Li. The velocity around 40 km/s appears to be a new critical value.",

We interpret J1244-LyC1 as a merger-driven starburst system in which tidal interactions have disrupted the interstellar medium, creating multiple low-column-density pathways that facilitate LyC escape. This discovery provides the first direct evidence of spatially resolved LyC escape in a merging system, offering new insight into the potential role of major mergers in driving the cosmic reionization.",

By tracking the complex electric field vector for each photon during its atmospheric transport and propagation in general relativistic and birefringent magnetospheres, our Monte Carlo simulation, named MAGTHOMSCATT, allows for capturing the complete polarization properties, including the intricate interplay between linearity and circularity. The new inclusion in MAGTHOMSCATT of quantum electrodynamical influences on polarization in the magnetosphere is presented. We simulate the pulsed and polarized X-ray emission from the outer layers of optically thick, fully ionized atmospheres of neutron stars, with a focus on the radiation emitted from extended polar caps of magnetars, which are the most highly magnetized neutron stars. Using the recent intensity pulse profile data for the magnetar 1RXS J11708-4009, we constrain the geometric parameters, namely the angles between the magnetic axis and the observer's viewing direction relative to the spin axis, as well as the sizes of emission regions. The distributions of these parameters and the best-fit configuration are provided. In addition, we discuss the important impacts of vacuum birefringence in the magnetosphere on increasing the linear polarization degree. A comparison with the case of a weakly magnetized neutron star, RX J0822.0-4300, is also discussed. Our simulation still needs further development, particularly to incorporate the vacuum resonance effect.

For linear regression, this problem was solved by treating the true input values as latent variables to be estimated alongside model parameters. In this paper, we show that neural networks suffer from the same attenuation bias and that the latent variable solution generalizes directly to neural networks. We introduce LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing the joint likelihood of observing both inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the correction on one-dimensional regression, multivariate inputs with correlated features, and stellar spectroscopy applications. LatentNN reduces attenuation bias across a range of signal-to-noise ratios where standard neural networks show large bias. This provides a framework for improved neural network inference in the low signal-to-noise regime characteristic of astronomical data. This bias correction is most effective when measurement errors are less than roughly half the intrinsic data range; in the regime of very low signal-to-noise and few informative features.

Our size-velocity dispersion relationship agrees with those of Milky Way (MW) and M31 clouds. The slope of our size-mass relationship is shallower than those in clouds and cloud complexes of the MW.

We find a slope of 0.66$\\pm$0.07 for the KS law, which is slightly lower than the values of $\\sim$0.8 for MW clouds.",

        "abstract": "Filamentary infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are believed to represent the initial conditions for massive star and cluster formation. We investigate the IRDC G035.39-00.33 using SiO, H13CO+, CH3OH, and CS emission observed with ALMA at 3.5\\arcsec\\ resolution (0.05 pc). The SiO emission traces shock activity within the cloud, providing insights into current star formation and cloud formation mechanisms. We identify several regions with broad SiO emission clearly associated with outflows, pinpointing the locations of ongoing star formation across the cloud. The ALMA images also reveal a series of spatially extended SiO emission spots with narrow line profiles, aligned along an arc-like path that is also seen in CS and CH3OH emission. While the broad SiO emission is mainly associated with the main cloud filament, as seen in visual extinction, the narrow SiO arch is located at the edge of the cloud, far from the identified sites of star formation activity. The presence of these arc-like morphologies suggests that large-scale shocks may have compressed the gas in the surroundings of the G035.39-00.33 cloud, shaping its filamentary structure. By inspecting the large-scale radio continuum emission around G035.39-00.33, we find that this IRDC is part of a larger star-forming complex where the densest and coolest material appears at the interacting regions between a Supernova Remnant (SNR) and an expanding HII region. In particular, we hypothesize that this IRDC may be spatially coincident with the ionized expanding gas associated with the previously identified SNR G35.6-0.4. We suggest that collisions between giant molecular clouds and expanding gas flows from interacting SNRs and HII regions may be responsible for the observed arc-like structures. Such shock compressions could play an important role in the formation of IRDCs and in the potential triggering of star formation.",

        "abstract": "This study re-evaluates the previously assumed interaction between the galaxy pair UGC 694 and IC 412 through a combined kinematical and photometric approach. While morphological features such as tidal bridges have been visually identified in past surveys, our quantitative analysis using SDSS DR16 kinematical data reveals a significant radial velocity offset of approximately 8372 km/s. UGC 694 exhibits a heliocentric velocity of 12683 +/- 34 km/s, placing it at a distance of approximately 188 Mpc, whereas IC 412 is located in the foreground at approximately 62 Mpc with a velocity of 4311 +/- 46 km/s. This vast spatial separation of approximately 123.5 Mpc confirms that the perceived proximity is a line-of-sight projection effect rather than a physical gravitational encounter. Furthermore, we utilize differential photometry to analyze the structural asymmetry and color distribution of UGC 694. Our photometric findings suggest that the galaxy's disturbed morphology is not a result of a tidal encounter with IC 412, but likely originates from internal evolutionary processes or minor mergers with undetected companions. This work emphasizes the critical role of multi-wavelength validation in classifying interacting systems to avoid misinterpretation due to projection effects.",

        "abstract": "Quasar samples remain severely incomplete at low Galactic latitudes because of strong extinction and source confusion. We conduct a systematic search for quasars behind the Galactic plane using X-ray sources from the Chandra Source Catalog (CSC 2.1), combined with optical data from Gaia DR3 and mid-infrared data from CatWISE2020. Using spectroscopically confirmed quasars and stars from data sets including DESI, SDSS, and LAMOST, we apply a Random Forest classifier to identify quasar candidates, with stellar contaminants suppressed using Gaia proper-motion constraints. Photometric redshifts are estimated for the candidates using a Random Forest regression model. Applying this framework to previously unclassified CSC sources, we identify 6286 quasar candidates, including 863 Galactic Plane Quasar (GPQ) candidates at |b|<20{\\deg}, of which 514 are high-confidence candidates. Relative to the previously known GPQ sample, our selected GPQs reach fainter optical and X-ray fluxes, improving sensitivity to low-flux GPQs. In addition, both the GPQ candidates and known GPQs display harder X-ray spectra than the all-sky quasar sample, consistent with increased absorption through the Galactic plane. Pilot spectroscopy confirms two high-confidence GPQ candidates as quasars at spectroscopic redshifts of z=1.2582 and z=1.1313, and further spectroscopic follow-up of the GPQ sample is underway. This work substantially improves the census of GPQs and provides a valuable target sample for future spectroscopic follow-up, enabling the use of GPQs to refine the reference frames for astrometry and probe the Milky Way interstellar and circumgalactic media with the absorption features of GPQs.",

Stacking analyses coadd cutouts of LIM data on positions of known signal emitters, robustly detecting signal otherwise hidden in a noisy map. In this article, we present two augmentations of a stacking pipeline, both aiming to refine the sensitivity of the stack by assuming a specific observed signal shape in 2D spatial axes or 3D spatial and spectral axes, as well as stacking on source coordinates more precise than the resolution of the LIM data cube. We test these methods on a series of simplistic and complex simulations mimicking observations with the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder. We find that these fitting methods provide up to a 25% advantage in detection significance over the original stack method in realistic COMAP-like simulations. We also find that the optimal fitting profile, given our CO line model and galaxy model, is larger than the 5' width of the COMAP beam and takes on a Lorentzian shape in the spectral dimension. Our findings suggest a nuanced dependence of the optimal profile size and shape on the LIM signal itself, including redshift-space clustering and fingers-of-God effects that depend on the tracer luminosity function and bias.",

In this work, we investigate the impact of spherically symmetric dark-matter distributions on black hole geometry, geodesic structure, and ringdown phenomenology. Modeling the surrounding matter through Einstein clusters, we construct self-consistent spacetimes for three widely used density profiles - the Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), and Jaffe models - and examine how their near-horizon behavior modifies the location and stability of circular timelike and null geodesics, including the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and light rings. In the low-compactness regime, we derive analytical expressions showing that environmental effects generically shift the ISCO inward and the principal light ring outward, leading to parametric deviations in their associated orbital frequencies and Lyapunov exponents. At higher compactness, we explore the emergence of additional light rings, marginally stable orbits, and secondary horizons, identifying the regions of parameter space in which these ultracompact configurations arise. Using time-domain evolutions of scalar perturbations, we demonstrate how such structures can imprint characteristic signatures on the ringdown signal, including long-lived trapped modes and echo-like modulations associated with multiple potential barriers. Our results provide a unified framework for assessing environmental effects around black holes and highlight the importance of matter-induced corrections for interpreting upcoming electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations.",

        "abstract": "Cepheids are fundamental distance indicators, playing a crucial role not only in the cosmic distance ladder but also in mapping the structure, kinematics, and extinction properties of the Milky Way. Using high-precision photometry and parallaxes from $Gaia$, we identify a significant anti-correlation between the $G$-band extinction coefficient and reddening for Galactic Cepheids, quantified as $R_G = 1.921 \\pm 0.060 - (0.107 \\pm 0.022)\\,E(G_{\\mathrm{BP}} - G_{\\mathrm{RP}})$. We propose that this anti-correlation is partly driven by the pronounced non-linear effects inherent to the broad $Gaia$ bands, while the remaining part arise from the $R_V$ variations caused by diverse interstellar medium. Adopting a fixed $R_G$ would not only lead to an overestimation of the metallicity dependence of Cepheid luminosities, but also systematically underestimate the distances to highly reddened Cepheids. Moreover, the strong reddening dependence of $R_G$ makes Wesenheit function based on it unsuitable for highly reddened Cepheids, since the definition of Wesenheit magnitudes requires a fixed extinction coefficient. In contrast, infrared-based distances, being less affected by non-linear effects and insensitive to $R_V$, provide the most reliable Cepheid distances at present. This work emphasizes the importance of accurately determining $R_V$ for Galactic Cepheids and accounting for non-linear effects in distance measurements, particularly in the optical bands.",

The method factorizes a spectroscopic time series into principal spectra and time-dependent kernels, enabling simultaneous recovery of both.

In the high-SNR regime, this provides a linearized and statistically tractable estimate of differential velocities. The method is validated on synthetic and SOAP simulations and applied to EXPRES observations of HD 34411 and $\\tau$ Ceti, recovering coherent signals and reaching the instrumental precision limit of ~30 cm/s. Apart from p-mode modulation, the residuals show no significant long-term correlations and allow the detection of signals with semi-amplitudes down to ~50 cm/s with $\\lesssim10$ cm/s uncertainty.

We introduce Starkindler, a novel training objective that explicitly incorporates observational errors into the model's objective function, thereby directly accounting for aleatoric uncertainty. Unlike traditional probabilistic models that focus solely on epistemic uncertainty, Starkindler provides uncertainty estimates that are regularised by aleatoric uncertainty, and is designed to be more interpretable. We train a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) using data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and compare against the Photometric redshift estimates provided by SDSS. We show improvements in accuracy, calibration and reduction in predicted outlier rate. We also conduct an ablation study which confirms that excluding observational errors significantly degrades model performance, underscoring the importance of accounting for aleatoric uncertainty. Our results suggest that Starkindler not only enhances predictive performance but also provides interpretable uncertainty estimates, making it a robust tool for astronomical data analysis.",

By analyzing four models of DM-nucleon interactions -- namely scalar, vector, pseudoscalar, and axial-vector mediators -- we derive constraints on the coupling parameters using data from the LZ, XENON, and Borexino experiments, covering mediator mass from $10^{-6}$ to $1$ GeV. As the mediator mass varies, the shift in dominance between momentum transfer and mediator mass leads to a turnover in the constraints around $10^{-2}$--$10^{-3}~\\mathrm{GeV}$. Our results extend the reach of direct detection into the sub-GeV window and clarify the critical role of momentum dependence in light-mediator scenarios.",

The background spacetime is assumed to be a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe. Within this framework, we explicitly construct nonlinear long-wavelength solutions for cosmological perturbations. Since multi-fluid systems are inherently non-adiabatic, these solutions admit both adiabatic and entropy modes already at leading nonlinear order. We define adiabatic and entropy perturbations and discuss the non-uniqueness in defining pure entropy perturbations. Using different choices of pure entropy initial conditions, we analyze the time evolution of physical quantities such as the curvature perturbation and density perturbations in the geodesic slicing for two-fluid systems.",

Accurately constraining the internal DM content of DANSs is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we construct the equations of state (EoS) for DANS matter by employing twelve nuclear matter (NM) models within the covariant density functional (CDF) theory and a self-interacting fermionic model for DM. Using these EoSs as input, we solve the two-fluid Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations to systematically investigate the influence of DM on the global properties of neutron stars (NSs). By incorporating recent observational constraints on NS properties, the maximum DM mass fraction $f_\\chi^{\\mathrm{max}}$ in DANSs is determined for each NM EoS model. Our analysis reveals a strong linear correlation (Pearson coefficient $r=0.98$) between $f_\\chi^{\\mathrm{max}}$ and the maximum mass of a pure NS, $M_{\\rm{NS}}^{\\mathrm{max}}$, described by $f_{\\chi}^{\\mathrm{max}} = 0.22 M_{\\mathrm{NS}}^{\\mathrm{max}} - 0.44$. Leveraging this correlation and the observed NS maximum mass distribution, $P(M_{\\text{NS}}^{\\max} \\mid \\text{EM})$, we derive the probability distribution function (PDF) for the maximum DM mass, $P(M_{\\chi}^{\\max} \\mid \\text{EM})$, in DANSs. We find that at the 68\\% confidence level, $M_{\\chi}^{\\mathrm{max}}=0.150^{+0.070}_{-0.051}\\ M_{\\odot}$. This quantitative constraint on the DM mass provides a critical prior for interpreting potential observational signatures of DANSs, such as anomalous tidal deformabilities and distinctive gravitational-wave signals.",

The high astrometric precision of the CSST Survey Camera for faint objects enables the detection of a number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs via differential astrometry in its optical survey. In this paper, we predict the number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around stars and brown dwarfs detectable with CSST astrometry. We generate synthetic samples of CSST stellar and substellar sources, and carry out companion injection-recovery simulations in the samples using different occurrence rates for FGK-dwarfs, M-dwarfs, and brown dwarfs. We calculate companion yields based on CSST astrometric precision. Our analysis reveals that over its 10-year mission, the CSST Survey Camera could barely discover giant planets and low-mass BDs around FGK-dwarfs, but is projected to detect 20 - 170 giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs within 300 pc, and 300 - 570 brown dwarf binaries within 600 pc. Therefore, CSST astrometry is likely to significantly increase the current sample of substellar companions around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This sample will deepen our understanding of planet formation and evolution around low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.",

        "abstract": "Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) prompt and afterglow emission, as well as a kilonova (KN), are the expected electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of Binary Neutron Star (BNS) and Neutron Star -- Black Hole (NSBH) mergers. We aim to infer the KN ejecta parameters and the progenitor properties by modeling merger-driven GRBs with a claim of KN, good data and robust redshift measurement. We model the afterglow and KN, and perform a Bayesian analysis, within the Nuclear physics and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (NMMA) framework. The KN emission is modeled with the radiative transfer code POSSIS and for afterglow we use the afterglowpy library. In contrast to previous approaches, our methodology simultaneously models both afterglow and KN. We find that all GRBs in our sample have a KN, but we were unable to confirm or exclude its presence in GRB 150101B. A BNS progenitor is favored for GRB 160821B, GRB 170817A/AT2017gfo, GRB 211211A, and GRB 230307A. For GRB 150101B and GRB 191019A, we obtain a slight preference for NSBH scenario, while a BNS is also viable. For KN emission, we find that the median wind mass $\\langle M_{\\rm wind}\\rangle=0.027^{+0.046}_{-0.019}$ $M_{\\odot}$ is larger than the dynamical $\\langle M_{\\rm dyn}\\rangle = 0.012^{+0.007}_{-0.006}$ $M_{\\odot}$. We find that $M_{\\rm wind}$ and the beaming corrected kinetic energy of the jet can be attributed as $log(M_{\\rm wind})=-20.23+0.38\\,log(E_{0,J})$. We confirm the results of numerical simulation that $\\tilde\\Lambda$ increases with decrease in $\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm \\,Chirp}$.

The method employs a reverse SDE guided by a score model trained exclusively on random realizations of the primordial low $\\ell$ B-mode angular power spectrum corresponding to a fixed tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.001$. During inference, the reverse SDE iteratively drives the observed angular power spectrum toward the learned primordial manifold, effectively denoising and delensing the input. The model is tested on simulated observational spectra that include gravitational lensing, complex polarized foreground combinations, and instrumental noise characteristics representative of the proposed ECHO mission. The trained score model learns the underlying statistical distribution of the primordial B-mode field for the given $r$, which acts as a physics-guided prior that can generate new, consistent realizations of the signal. This approach provides a robust framework for primordial signal recovery in future CMB polarization missions.",

These cross sections represent experimental benchmark data for the further development of quantum theoretical methods, which will have to provide the bulk of the atomic data required for the modeling of nonequilibrium plasmas such as kilonovae. In the present work, we have upgraded the Jena Atomic Calculator (JAC) and pushed the state-of-the-art of quantum calculations for heavy many-electron systems to new limits. In particular, we have performed large-scale calculations of the La$^+$ photoabsorption cross section and of the deexcitation cascades, which set in after the initial creation of a $3d$ hole. Our theoretical results largely agree with our experimental findings. However, our theoretical product-ion charge state distributions are somewhat narrower than the experimental ones, which is most probably due to the simplifications necessary to keep the cascade calculations tractable.",

Radio emission has recently been detected in TDEs and is commonly attributed to synchrotron radiation from both wind and jetted outflows. However, several TDEs exhibit bright radio flares at late times, which cannot be easily explained if the wind is launched promptly after the stellar disruption. In this study, we model the radio light curves of TDEs with delayed radio flares using three scenarios: an instantaneous wind, a delayed wind, and a delayed relativistic jet. We show that the instantaneous wind model struggles to reproduce delayed radio flare events, indicating the necessity of an additional delayed outflow component. In contrast, the delayed wind model provides a consistent explanation for the observed radio phenomenology, successfully reproducing events both with and without delayed radio flares. For some delayed radio flare events (e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT 2019dsg), both the delayed wind and delayed jet models can reproduce the observed radio light curves. The delayed jet model produces x-ray and optical emission that is detectable at typical TDE distances, in contrast to wind-driven scenarios. This highlights how multiwavelength observations offer an effective means of distinguishing among possible outflow mechanisms.",

The different configurations yield unique, observationally testable predictions. In the $0.1-10$~TeV energy range, where current observations provide only upper limits, they predict either a deep dip, a mild suppression, or a power-law spectrum. Additionally, models involving AU-scale blob regions predict strong variability, while those invoking more extended and static external zones show more stable behavior. We also provide a possible qualitative explanation for the distinct modulation patterns across different energy bands, which relies primarily on changes in the Doppler factor and external $\\gamma\\gamma$ absorption.

A genetic algorithm is employed for the global numerical solution and statistical inference of the background field dynamics. To overcome the single channel dominance degeneracy in high dimensional parameter scans, two classes of structural priors are introduced into the objective function: a \\texttt{mixing} prior to suppress extreme channel fractions and an \\texttt{entropy} prior to favor multi channel coexistence. Furthermore, the adoption of a layered warmness criterion (e.g., $Q \\equiv \\Upsilon/3H$) decouples model selection from cosmological observables, thereby enhancing analytical transparency. The complete workflow is demonstrated on a $14$ dimensional phenomenological model. An ablation study of the priors (\\texttt{noprior} vs. \\texttt{mixing} vs. \\texttt{mixing+entropy}) yields $18871$ viable parameter points, revealing that the priors significantly enhance the discovery probability of non-trivial multi channel solutions within a parameter space naturally biased towards single channel dominance. After imposing the observational constraint $r < 0.036$, the number of retained solutions for each scenario is $14485$, $1889$, and $1971$, respectively.

Individual GRBs with well-defined positive-to-negative lag transitions have been used to set lower limits on $E_{\\rm QG}$, but they suffer from uncertainties of spectral-lag measurements and systematics due to theoretical modeling of each burst. Here, we combine observations of 32 GRBs with positive-to-negative lag transitions to derive a statistically robust constraint on $E_{\\rm QG}$ through hierarchical Bayesian inference. We find that the dominant systematic uncertainty in LIV constraints arises from the intrinsic lag modeling.

As the modification parameter $\\alpha$ increases, neutron stars grow in both radius and mass. We find that, when the parameter $\\alpha$ is sufficiently large, a frozen state emerges at the end of the neutron-star sequence. In this state, the metric functions approach zero extremely close to the stellar surface, forming a critical horizon, making it nearly indistinguishable from a black hole to an external observer.

In direction-dependent calibration, these data may have a volume an order of magnitude larger than the original data. Existing lossy compression techniques work well for observed, noisy data, but cause issues in calibration when applied to forward-predicted model data. Aims. To reduce the volume of forward-predicted model data, we present a lossless compression method called Simulated Signal Compression (Sisco) for noiseless data that integrates seamlessly with existing workflows. We show that Sisco can be combined with baseline-dependent averaging for further size reduction. Methods. Sisco decomposes complex floating-point visibility values and uses polynomial extrapolation in time and frequency to predict values, groups bytes for efficient encoding, and compresses residuals using the Deflate algorithm. We evaluate Sisco on diverse LOFAR, MeerKAT, and MWA datasets with various extrapolation functions. Implemented as an open-source Casacore storage manager, it can directly be used by any observatory that makes use of this format. Results. We find that a combination of linear and quadratic prediction yields optimal compression, reducing noiseless forward-predicted model data to 24% of its original volume on average. Compression varies by dataset, ranging from 13% for smooth data to 38% for less predictable data. For pure noise data, compression achieves just a size of 84% due to the unpredictability of such data. With the current implementation, the achieved compression throughput is with 534 MB/s mostly dominated by I/O on our testing platform, but occupies the processor during compression or decompression. Finally, we discuss the extension to a lossy algorithm.",

The resulting rules closely resemble those familiar from flat-space scattering amplitudes, but with an additional subtlety: in order to express the discontinuity of a correlator as the product of lower-order correlators, one must introduce a specific combinations of diagrams which do not appear in the computation of observables themselves.

        "abstract": "Continuous gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars are on the new frontiers of gravitational wave astrophysics and have strong connections to electromagnetic astronomy, nuclear astrophysics, and condensed matter physics. In this Colloquium I survey prospects for detection of continuous gravitational waves from various neutron star populations, especially aided by electromagnetic observations. Although there are caveats, current theories and observations suggest that the first detections are likely within a few years, and that many are likely in the era of next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. I also survey what can be learned from these signals, each one of which will contain more cycles than all the compact binary mergers ever detected. Since continuous gravitational wave emission mechanisms depend on aspects of neutron star physics, such as crustal elasticity, which are not well constrained by current astronomical observations and physical experiments, their detection can tell us a great deal that is new about extreme matter. Even more can be learned by combining gravitational wave observations with data from the Square Kilometre Array, the Next Generation Very Large Array, FAST, and other electromagnetic detectors operating in the next generation era.",

Incorporating explicit $Z_2$-breaking bias terms can lead to annihilation of such walls while also emitting stochastic gravitational wave (GW). We study the role of heavy right-handed neutrinos present in type-I seesaw origin of light neutrino masses to generate such bias term via quantum corrections. This offers interesting correlation among the seesaw scale, GW peak amplitude and peak frequency which can be probed at present and future experiments related to GW as well as precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In flavor symmetric UV complete scenarios with degenerate RHNs at leading order, such tiny coupling of RHNs to a $Z_2$-odd scalar can also lead to small mass splittings suitable for explaining the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via resonant leptogenesis.",

SN 2022eyw reached a peak absolute magnitude of $M_g = -17.80\\pm0.15$ mag and exhibited a rise time of $\\sim$15 days, placing it among the brighter Iax events. The bolometric light curve indicates a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.120\\pm0.003~\\text{M}_{\\odot}$, with an estimated ejecta mass of $0.79\\pm0.09~\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ and kinetic energy of $0.19\\times10^{51}$ erg. The spectral evolution from -8 to +110 days past maximum reveals features characteristic of bright Type Iax Supernovae, including a transition from Fe III to Fe II dominance, moderate expansion velocities, and a lack of strong C III absorption. TARDIS spectral modelling of the early-phase spectra indicates a well-mixed ejecta dominated by Fe-group elements. In addition, traces of unburnt carbon are detected, pointing to incomplete burning as expected in pure deflagration models. Late-time spectral evolution shows a blend of permitted and forbidden lines. Comparison with deflagration models suggests that SN 2022eyw originated from a partial deflagration of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, with explosion properties intermediate between the N3-def and N5-def models. These observations support pure deflagration of a CO white dwarf as a viable explosion mechanism for its luminous members.",

It is commonly argued that the spins of accreting neutron stars are regulated by gravitational wave emission and that millisecond pulsars contain a young pulsar's magnetic field buried under accreted material. If either of these arguments holds, the first detection of continuous gravitational waves is likely with near future upgrades of current detectors, and many detections are likely with next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. A lack of detections in the next several years would begin to raise serious doubts about current theories of millisecond pulsar formation.",

We conducted our analysis using TESS long-cadence data complemented with high-resolution spectra from three spectrographs. From the initial sample of almost 46000 objects, we selected 35 targets for spectroscopic follow-up. Comparison of light curves and radial velocity curves allowed for robust classification of these targets. Among the 35 selected objects, 18 displayed variability, suggesting the presence of a companion (including the discovery of 7 new binary systems and 1 candidate for a triple-star system), 1 was identified as a new pulsator, 9 as new candidates for spotted stars, and 7 objects had uncertain classification. Our analysis shows that at least half of randomly selected stars with sinusoidal brightness variations are binaries. The presented results illustrate the need for an individual approach to stellar classification, especially in cases where the photometric data alone is insufficient for determining the underlying phenomena behind the observed variations.",

In nuclear matter, SRCs arise primarily from the spin-isospin dependence of the tensor and short-range components of the nucleon-nucleon interaction, leading to a substantial depletion of its Fermi sea and a characteristic $k^{-4}$ tail populated predominantly by isosinglet neutron-proton pairs. These microscopic structures modify both the kinetic and interaction contributions to the Equation of State (EOS) of dense matter and thereby influence a broad range of neutron-star (NS) properties. This short review provides a streamlined overview of how SRC-induced changes in $n(k)$ reshape the kinetic EOS, including its symmetry energy part and how these effects propagate into macroscopic NS observables, including mass-radius relations, tidal deformabilities, direct Urca thresholds and core-crust transition. We summarize key existing results, highlight current observational constraints relevant for testing SRC-HMT effects, and outline open questions for future theoretical, experimental, and multimessenger studies of dense nucleonic matter.",

We find that above 0.1 Hz, CIGO achieves better localization accuracy than the other two space-based missions and dominates the combined detector network's performance, provided that lunar noise mitigation is achieved in the 0.1-2.87 Hz frequency range. We further explore an upgraded Tetrahedron configuration, TCIGO, with a fourth station at the bottom of a crater, which forms a regular tetrahedral constellation on the lunar surface.

In particular, each counterterm needed to renormalize the graviton self-energy satisfies its own Noether identity, and we derive the explicit form for each. Finally, in order to understand how the Noether-Ward identities are affected by the definition of the metric perturbation, we consider two inequivalent definitions of metric perturbations and derive the Noether-Ward identities for both definitions. This implies that there are Noether-Ward identities for every definition of the metric perturbation.",

        "abstract": "In the outer core of neutron stars, $^3$P$_2$ superfluid neutrons and $^1$S$_0$ superconducting protons are deemed to exist, forming quantum vortices and magnetic fluxtubes, respectively. Those quantum vortices and fluxtubes play an important role in explaining observed sudden changes of rotational frequency, known as pulsar ``glitches.'' While the most of conventional glitch models rely on pinning/unpinning dynamics of neutron $^1\\text{S}_0$ superfluid vortices in the inner crust, contributions of the outer core have not been ruled out. However, the latter possibility has been less explored so far and further thorough investigations are desired. In this study, we are thus developing a microscopic model based on spin-2 Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for neutron $^3$P$_2$ superfluid vortices coupled with Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE) for fluxtubes associated with superconducting $^1\\text{S}_0$ protons. In this contribution, we outline our theoretical framework and report tentative results showing how shape of quantum vortices could be affected by the presence of a proton fluxtube.",

        "abstract": "The MAGIC detection of near-TeV gamma-rays from the 2021 outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) has established it as a TeV-scale particle accelerator. However, the underlying production mechanism --\\textit{hadronic} versus \\textit{leptonic}-- remains uncertain due to the non-detection of coincident neutrinos at IceCube. Indeed, the neutrino flux predicted by the hadronic model for RS Oph was below IceCube sensitivity. T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), a nova similar to RS Oph, is anticipated to undergo an outburst soon. Being closer to Earth (0.8 kpc versus 2.45 kpc for RS Oph), T CrB is expected to yield a higher neutrino flux, making the upcoming outburst a once in a lifetime opportunity to test-and potentially detect-nova neutrinos. In this work, we present the first model-based estimates of the hadronic secondary fluxes from T CrB and assess their detectability with gamma-ray (LHAASO, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, H.E.S.S., MACE, and HERD) and neutrino (IceCube and KM3NeT) telescopes. We adopt two proton-acceleration mechanisms: (i) an external shock (ES) driven mechanism at the interaction ($10^{13}$ cm) of nova ejecta and the red giant wind, and (ii) magnetic reconnection (MR) near the white dwarf surface ($10^{9}$ cm). The latter, arising deep inside the nova system, will fully absorb gamma-rays while allowing only neutrinos to escape. This could potentially produce neutrino signals hours before the ES origin photons or neutrinos-a unique temporal delay signature. For our benchmark ES model, gamma-rays are detectable across all facilities, while the neutrino detection prospect is poor. Only a tiny upper part of the ES model parameter space is above IceCube/KM3NeT sensitivity. In contrast, both observatories have significantly better prospects for detecting neutrinos in the MR scenario.",

To perform statistical analysis of the complete ensemble of binary stars, including both previously known and newly discovered pairs, cross-identification by coordinates was carried out between the most complete pre-Gaia publication compilative binary star catalog ILB and data from binary star catalogs based on Gaia DR3 results. An analysis of the results of this identification was performed, showing the dependence of its characteristics both on the data from the source catalogs and on coordinates. It is shown that in dense stellar fields, particularly in the Galactic disk, an increase in the fraction of false positive identifications can be expected. At the same time, for systems with large proper motion, there is a high probability of a false negative outcome. Possible modifications to the identification method are proposed to reduce the role of the described systematic errors and increase the reliability of its results.",

Due to randomly triggered accretion events, the lifetime of the retriggered jet is not expected to have any connection to the time of quiescence between jets, yet we show that a correlation between the two quantities may exist, which we interpret as resulting from continued accretion through the quiescent jet phase. Despite continuous accretion, a jet is absent because its presence depends on a non-zero value of black hole spin, but accretion transitions the system from counter-rotation to corotation, and therefore through zero black hole spin where a jet cannot form. The time of jet quiescence depends on how long it takes to spin the black hole up again in corotation, which is longer for lower accretion rates. Once the black hole spin is large enough for a renewed jet, this inner jet will last longer the lower the accretion rate is. Hence, in a continuous accretion scenario, longer quiescent times tend to associate to longer inner jet times. In addition, DDRG jets are of FRII morphology which we show to result from the absence of a tilt in the accretion disk in the transition through zero black hole spin, ensuring the absence of an FRI jet in a way that connects with our understanding of X-shaped radio galaxies. Both correlated timescales as well as sameness in jet morphology offers evidence in favor of our picture.",

        "abstract": "Over the past two decades, the \\textit{Swift} and \\textit{Fermi} missions have identified a rare class of ``double-trigger'' gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that produce two independent trigger events. These events are characterized by a sufficiently long quiescent period during which the on-board trigger system can reset, resulting in the subsequent emission being recorded as a second independent event. Consistent sky localization confirms that both trigger events originated from the same astrophysical source. Here, we present a systematic classification and characteristics study of three such cases: GRB 091024A, GRB 110709B, and GRB 220627A. We investigate each trigger episode emission independently using standard classification diagnostics, including duration ($T_{90}$), hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), spectral lag ($\\tau_{\\rm lag}$), peak energy ($E_{\\rm p}$), and energetics. We compare these properties with those of typical long GRBs (LGRBs) and with single-trigger LGRBs that exhibit extended quiescent periods. Our analysis reveals that all sub-bursts from the three double-trigger events consistently lie within the LGRB classification region. These results indicate that double-trigger GRBs are not a physically distinct subclass, but rather products of LGRB central engines that undergo extended dormancy and subsequent reactivation.",

Among options for definition of the lunar reference time, the option taking Lunar Coordinate Time (O1) has its simplicity but cannot be realized by any clock without steering, while another option adopting the lunar geoid (selenoid) proper time (O2) has its convenience for users on the lunar surface but would bring a new scaling of spatial coordinates and mass parameter of the Moon. Aims. We propose a ''time aligned orbit'' that the readings of an ideal clock in this orbit could equal to the selenoid proper time in O2 and these readings could be converted to Lunar Coordinate Time in O1 by a known linear transformation. Methods. We show that there exist the time aligned orbit around the Moon with its semi-major axis of about 1.5 lunar radius slightly depending on its inclination. We conduct a set of numerical simulations to assess to what extent a clock on these orbits could realize O2 in a more realistic lunar environment. Results. We find that the proper time in our simulations would desynchronize from the selenoid proper time up to 190 ns after a year with a frequency offset of 6E-15, which is solely 3.75% of the frequency difference in O2 caused by the lunar surface topography. These numbers might be further reduced to 13 ns and 4E-16, if we could account for the deviation of the mean orbits in our simulations from the nominal ones. Conclusions. One might simultaneously realize O1 and O2 by deployment of a single clock in the time aligned orbit.

In this paper, we show that similar performance is possible in an offset Gregorian reflector system using a RIS on the rim of the subreflector. Applications include radio astronomy, where offset Gregorian reflectors are common and observations are subject to deleterious levels of interference from satellites entering through sidelobes. We show that an efficient RIS replacing the outer one-third of the subreflector surface, employing passive elements with 1-bit phase-only control, can create a null in the peak of the second sidelobe in the quiescent pattern. This is achieved using a simple unconstrained optimization algorithm to set the states of the RIS elements. The algorithm yields a deep null with just 0.2~dB reduction in main lobe directivity, despite lacking any constraints on main lobe pattern. Compared to our previous approach of mounting the RIS on the rim of the main reflector, the subreflector-based approach demonstrated in this paper requires a much smaller RIS and can implemented in existing systems by replacing the subreflector.",

Using the Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) and Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) methods, we find tentative evidence for a month-scale QPO; however, its detection significance is limited by the small number of observed cycles.

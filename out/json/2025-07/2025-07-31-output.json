        "abstract": "We present a novel method to differentiate stream-like and shell-like tidal remnants of stellar systems in galactic halos using the density-based approach of the clustering algorithm AstroLink. While previous studies lean on observation, phase-space, and action-space based criteria for stream and shell determination, we introduce AstroLink's ordered-density plot and cluster identification as a viable tool for classification. For a given data set, the AstroLink ordered-density plot reveals the density-based hierarchical clustering structure from which the resultant clusters are identified as being statistically significant overdensities. Using simulations of sub-halo disruptions in an external potential to generate samples of tidal structures, we find that the curvature of the ordered-density plot is positive for stream-like structures and negative for shell-like structures. Comparisons with more standard classification techniques reveal strong agreement on which structures typically fit into stream-like and shell-like categories. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of clustered stream and shell samples in radial phase space and energy-angle space. Given the sensitivity of stellar tidal structures to their host dark matter halos, the identification and subsequent classification of these structures provide exciting avenues of investigation in galactic evolution dynamics and dark matter structure formation.",

However, computational constraints still severely limit their numerical resolution. This not only restricts the sampling of the stellar component and its direct comparison to detailed observations, but also the precision with which it is evolved. To overcome these problems we introduce the \\emph{Superstars} method. This method increases the stellar mass resolution in cosmological galaxy simulations in a computationally inexpensive way for a fixed dark matter and gas resolution without altering any global properties of the simulated galaxies. We demonstrate the \\emph{Superstars} method for a Milky Way-like galaxy of the Auriga project, improving the stellar mass resolution by factors of $8$ and $64$. We show and quantify that this improves the sampling of the stellar population in the disc and halo without changing the properties of the central galaxy or its satellites, unlike simulations that change the resolution of all components (gas, dark matter, stars). Moreover, the better stellar mass resolution reduces numerical heating of the stellar disc in its outskirts and keeps substructures in the stellar disc and inner halo more coherent. It also makes lower mass and lower surface brightness structures in the stellar halo more visible. The \\emph{Superstars} method is straightforward to incorporate in any cosmological galaxy simulation that does not resolve individual stars.",

        "abstract": "We investigate cool HI gas traced by Lyman series absorption in the vicinity of 256 galaxies (median stellar mass, log10(M*/Msun) = 8.7 and median redshift, z = 0.48) using 15 background quasars (median impact parameter, D ~ 140 physical kpc (pkpc)), as part of the MUSE Quasar-fields Blind Emitters Survey (MUSEQuBES). We find that the HI column density (N(HI)) profile around isolated, star-forming galaxies, which span ~ 3 dex in stellar mass, is well described by a power law with a slope of ~ -2.3 when expressed as a function of the normalized impact parameter, D/Rvir. The HI covering fraction (k) within the virial radius, for a threshold of log10(N(HI)/cm^{-2}) = 14, is significantly lower for high-mass passive galaxies compared to their isolated, star-forming counterparts. The k-profile of isolated, star-forming galaxies suggests a characteristic size of the HI-rich CGM of ~ 1.5 Rvir, consistently across the stellar mass range. The mean HI mass in the outer CGM (0.3-1 Rvir ) increases with stellar mass, ranging from ~ 10^{5} to 10^{6.6} Msun. The b-parameters of the strongest HI components correlate and anti-correlate with specific star-formation rate (sSFR) and mass, respectively, with > 2 sigma significance. Broad Lya absorbers (BLAs) with b > 60 km s^{-1} are predominantly associated with high-mass galaxies, likely tracing the warm-hot phase of the CGM. The velocity centroids of HI components indicate that the absorbers at D < Rvir are predominantly consistent with being gravitationally bound to their associated galaxy, regardless of stellar mass. Finally, leveraging ~3000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from the wide-field Magellan follow-up of six MUSEQuBES fields, we find that non-isolated galaxies exhibit an HI-rich environment that extends approximately three times further than for their isolated counterparts.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we define the novel splashback depth $\\mathcal{D}$ and width $\\mathcal{W}$ to examine how the splashback features of dark matter haloes are affected by the physical properties of haloes themselves. We use the largest simulation run in the hydrodynamic MillenniumTNG project. By stacking haloes in bins of halo mass, redshift, mass-dependent properties such as peak height and concentration, and halo formation history, we measure the shape of the logarithmic slope of the density profile of dark matter haloes. Our results show that the splashback depth has a strong dependence on the halo mass which follows a power law $\\mathcal{D}\\propto\\left(\\log_{10}M\\right)^{2.8}$. Properties with strong correlation with halo mass demonstrate similar dependence. The splashback width has the strongest dependence on halo peak height and follows a power law $\\mathcal{W}\\propto\\nu^{-0.87}$. We provide the fitting functions of the splashback depth and width in terms of halo mass, redshift, peak height, concentrations and halo formation time. The depth and width are therefore considered to be a long term memory tracker of haloes since they depend more on accumulative physical properties, e.g., halo mass, peak height and halo formation time. They are shaped primarily by the halo's assembly history, which exerts a stronger influence on the inner density profile than short-term dynamical processes. In contrast, the splashback features have little dependence on the short term factors such as halo mass accretion rate and most recent major merger time. The splashback depth and width can therefore be used to complement information gained from quantities like the point of steepest slope or truncation radius to characterise the halo's history and inner structure.",

We provide a systematic theory derivation based on power counting, which features the first comprehensive treatment of stochastic EFT contributions -- these are found to significantly improve the match to data. Our computational pipeline utilizes the COBRA technique that expands the linear matter power spectrum over a basis of principal components based on a singular value decomposition, allowing the cosmology dependence to be captured to sub-permille accuracy with just eight templates. This transforms the problem of computing the one-loop EFT bispectrum to a simple tensor multiplication, reducing the computation time to around a second per cosmology with negligible loss of accuracy. Using these tools, we study the cosmological information in the bispectrum by analyzing PTChallenge simulations, whose gigantic volume provides the most powerful test of the one-loop EFT bispectrum so far. We find that the one-loop prediction provides an excellent match to the bispectrum data up to $k_{\\rm max}=0.15~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, as evidenced by the precise recovery of the dark matter density $\\omega_\\text{cdm}$, Hubble constant $H_0$, and mass fluctuation amplitude $\\sigma_8$ parameters, and the amplitude of equilateral primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm equil}$.

We also present the first [OIII]88 micron (hereafter [OIII]) line observations in such high redshift protocluster system. We obtain a [CII] line luminosity $\\sim$1.7$\\times$ more than the one recovered by ALMA towards the Core, while remarkably we recover 4$\\times$ more [CII] line emission than the one found in deep ALMA images towards the North component, suggesting that the most massive gas reservoirs lie in the less extreme regions of this protocluster system. A minimum ionised gas mass of $\\mathrm M_{\\rm min}(H^+)$$ \\sim$$3.7\\times 10^{10}$\\,\\Msun\\, is deduced from the [OIII] line, amounting to 30\\% of the molecular gas mass in the same area. Finally we obtain star formation rate (SFR) estimates using the [OIII] line luminosity, and the corresponding ionised gas mass. These yield values that can surpass the far-IR continuum-derived SFR (under the assumption of a standard stellar IMF), which can be reconciled only if non-stellar ionising sources contribute to the [OIII] line luminosity, or a top-heavy stellar IMF produces a larger fraction of O stars per total stellar mass, a distinct possibility in High-Energy-Particle (HEP) rather than (UV-photon)-dominated environments in clusters. Future work using far-IR fine-structure and molecular/neutral-atomic lines is necessary for determining the thermal/ionisation states of the multi-phase medium and these line ratios must be measured over a wide range of spatial scales, which ultimately requires combining wide-field single-dish and high resolution interferometric observations.",

We find that, among massive ETGs with identical average stellar mass distributions beyond 5 kpc, those with higher central velocity dispersion ($\\sigma_{cen}$) are older and more $\\alpha$-enhanced, suggesting a connection between the in-situ star formation in the past and the central gravitational potential today for massive ETGs with a similar stellar accretion history. Conversely, at fixed $\\sigma_{cen}$ and total stellar mass, galaxies with more extended stellar halos show lower [Fe/H], higher [Mg/Fe], and older ages, indicating an intriguing link between early starburst and quenching and later ex-situ assembly. These results demonstrate that the evolution of massive galaxies cannot be fully described by simple scaling relations alone, as the interplay between in-situ star formation and ex-situ accretion leaves distinct imprints in both their inner and outer stellar populations.

We aim to measure the bulk flow and the Hubble constant directly from the largest available sample of peculiar velocities, and without imposing a cosmological prior on the velocity field. To address these issues, we analyze the Cosmicflows-4 catalog, the most extensive catalog of galaxy peculiar velocities, reaching a redshift $z=0.1$. Specifically, we construct a forward modeling approach assuming only a flat Universe, which reconstructs the radial and bulk flows of the velocity field directly from measurements of peculiar velocities. Our method accurately recovers cosmological parameters within a radius of $120\\ \\mathrm{Mpc/h}$ that can then be compared with the predictions from $\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}$. Apart from a $3\\sigma$ tension with $\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}$ on the magnitude around $120\\ \\mathrm{Mpc/h}$ associated with a $4\\sigma$ tension on the supergalactic $X$ direction, we find a general agreement between the standard model and the observations. Lastly, our analysis suggests a Hubble constant value of approximately $75.8\\pm0.4\\ \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, exacerbating (or independently confirming) the existing ``Hubble tension\", however, for the first time accomplished with the largest set of peculiar velocities in existence.",

        "abstract": "Discrete symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the early universe may have caused the formation of networks of sheet-like topological defects, usually referred to as domain walls, which separate regions that have settled into different vacuum states. Field theory simulations predict the successive collapse of increasingly larger domains, which could potentially leave observable imprints in present-day large-scale structures. We use the parameter-free velocity-dependent one-scale model to provide an estimate of the final decay energy of these walls and their associated collapse rate, as a function of redshift. The energy released by collapsing walls can act as a seed for density perturbations in the background matter field, influencing structure formation. We estimate the dependence of the current mass of the resulting non-linear objects on the collapse redshift and wall tension, showing that domain walls can contribute to the formation of objects as massive as present-day galaxy clusters. Still, we confirm that the contribution of standard domain walls to structure formation is subdominant. In contrast, biased domain walls generally face much less stringent constraints on their tension, which allows for significantly higher collapse energies. Based on our analysis, we are able to show that the collapse of such biased wall networks can provide a significant contribution to structure formation, and, in particular, a mass excess at $z \\gtrsim 7$ as suggested by JWST data.",

        "abstract": "Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have suggested the existence of over-massive black holes (OMBHs) in high-redshift galaxies. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism for the formation of OMBHs, based on the accretion of globular clusters (GCs) in compact disk galaxies. We derive the conditions under which OMBHs can form, focusing on key parameters such as halo mass, redshift, and halo spin parameter. Our results show that at redshift $z = 10$, a halo with mass $10^{11}~M_{\\odot}$ and a spin parameter of $0.02$ can form a black hole of $1.4 \\times 10^{8}~M_{\\odot}$ through GC migration and accretion via tidal disruption events (TDEs). The resulting black hole-to-stellar mass ratio can reach $\\sim 0.1$, corresponding to the fraction of GC mass accreted onto the black hole. This mechanism thus provides a plausible explanation for the OMBHs observed by JWST. Furthermore, by combining our model with halo mass functions and the distribution of spin parameters, we construct black hole mass functions that successfully reproduce the number densities of massive BH candidates at $z \\sim 5$ inferred from JWST observations, and UHZ1 and GHZ9 at $z \\sim 10$.",

        "abstract": "Cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons are deflected by large-scale structure through gravitational lensing. This secondary effect introduces higher-order correlations in CMB anisotropies, which are used to reconstruct lensing deflections. This allows mapping of the integrated matter distribution along the line of sight, probing the growth of structure, and recovering an undistorted view of the last-scattering surface. Gravitational lensing has been measured by previous CMB experiments, with $\\textit{Planck}$'s $42\\,\\sigma$ detection being the current best full-sky lensing map. We present an enhanced $\\textit{LiteBIRD}$ lensing map by extending the CMB multipole range and including the minimum-variance estimation, leading to a $49$ to $58\\,\\sigma$ detection over $80\\,\\%$ of the sky, depending on the final complexity of polarized Galactic emission. The combination of $\\textit{Planck}$ and $\\textit{LiteBIRD}$ will be the best full-sky lensing map in the 2030s, providing a $72$ to $78\\,\\sigma$ detection over $80\\,\\%$ of the sky, almost doubling $\\textit{Planck}$'s sensitivity. Finally, we explore different applications of the lensing map, including cosmological parameter estimation using a lensing-only likelihood and internal delensing, showing that the combination of both experiments leads to improved constraints. The combination of $\\textit{Planck}$ + $\\textit{LiteBIRD}$ will improve the $S_8$ constraint by a factor of 2 compared to $\\textit{Planck}$, and $\\textit{Planck}$ + $\\textit{LiteBIRD}$ internal delensing will improve $\\textit{LiteBIRD}$'s tensor-to-scalar ratio constraint by $6\\,\\%$. We have tested the robustness of our results against foreground models of different complexity, showing that a significant improvement remains even for the most complex foregrounds.",

        "abstract": "The structure of spiral galaxies is essential to understanding the dynamics and evolution of disc galaxies; however, the precise nature of spiral arms remains uncertain. Two challenges in understanding the mechanisms driving spirals are how galactic environment impacts spiral morphology and how they evolve over time. We present a catalog characterizing the properties, dynamics, and evolution of m=2 spiral structure in 10 Milky Way-mass galaxies from the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations. Consistent with previous literature, we find that FIRE-2 spirals are transient, recurring features simultaneously present in the disc at varying pattern speeds ($\\Omega_p$) that broadly decrease with radius. These spirals persist on Gyr timescales (mean duration 1.90 Gyr), but fluctuate in amplitude on timescales of hundreds of Myr. Tidal interactions and bar episodes impact the resulting m=2 spiral structure; strong satellite interactions generally produce shorter-lived, stronger spirals with larger radial extent, and bars can increase $\\Omega_p$. Galactic environment influences spiral structure; kinematically colder discs can support longer-lived, stronger spirals. The properties of identified spirals in FIRE-2 vary widely in radial extent (0.3-10.8 kpc), duration (1.00-6.00 Gyr), and amplitudes ($a_{2,\\text{max}}$=0.018-0.192). We find the presence of spirals in all age populations, suggesting these are density wave-driven features. This work represents the first time that spiral structure has been cataloged in this manner in cosmological simulations; the catalog can be leveraged with current and forthcoming observational surveys, enabling systematic comparisons to further our understanding of galaxy evolution.",

We use Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) from DESI and DES, Cosmic Microwave Background (Planck) with and without lensing from Planck and ACT (noted CMB and CMBL, respectively), supernova (SN), and cross-correlations between galaxy positions and galaxy lensing from DES. First, we use pairs or trios of datasets where we exclude one type of datasets each time and categorize them as ``NO SN\", ``NO CMB\" and ``NO BAO\" combinations. In all cases, we find that the combinations favor the $w_0 w_a$CDM model over $\\Lambda$CDM, with significance ranging from 2.3$\\sigma$ to 3.3$\\sigma$. For example, DESI+DESY6BAO+CMB yields 3.2$\\sigma$ without SN, DESI+DESY6BAO+DESY5SN yields 3.3$\\sigma$ without CMB, and CMB+DESY5SN+DES3x2pts yields 2.6$\\sigma$ without BAO. The persistence of this pattern across various dataset combinations even when any of the dataset is excluded supports an overall validation of this trending result regardless of any specific dataset. Next, we use larger combinations of these datasets after verifying their mutual consistency within the $w_0 w_a$CDM model. We find combinations that give significance levels $\\sim$4$\\sigma$, with DESI+DESY6BAO+CMBL+DESY5SN reaching 4.4$\\sigma$. In sum, while we need to remain prudent, the combination of the first step that supports a validation of the pattern of these results beyond any single type of datasets and their associated systematics, together with the second step showing high-significance results when such datasets are combined, presents a compelling overall portrait in favor of a dynamical dark energy with a time-evolving equation of state over a cosmological constant, and constitutes a serious challenge to the $\\Lambda$CDM model's reign.

In this work, we search three fields for extragalactic transients. We identify six new extragalactic transients, and three known ones from a sample of 369,644 difference image analysis objects. Photometric classification using \\texttt{Superphot+} indicates that this sample likely comprises six type Ia, two type II, two type Ibc and one type IIn supernovae. Our findings are in slight tension with supernova detection rate predictions from the literature of $12\\pm3$ SN Ia and $3\\pm1$ core-collapse supernovae likely due to the lack of suitable templates.

        "abstract": "Molecular emission is a powerful tool for studying the physical and chemical structures of dense cores. The distribution and abundance of different molecules provide information on the chemical composition and physical properties in these cores. We study the chemical segregation of three molecules (c-C$_3$H$_2$, CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CCH) in the starless cores B68 and L1521E, and the prestellar core L1544. We applied the density-based clustering algorithms DBSCAN and HDBSCAN to identify chemical and physical structures within these cores. To enable cross-core comparisons, the input samples were characterised based on their physical environment, discarding the 2D spatial information. The clustering analysis showed significant chemical differentiation across the cores, successfully reproducing the known molecular segregation of c-C$_3$H$_2$ and CH$_3$OH in all three cores. Furthermore, it identifies a segregation between c-C$_3$H$_2$ and CH$_3$CCH, which is not apparent from the emission maps. Key features driving the clustering are integrated intensity, velocity offset, H$_2$ column density, and H$_2$ column density gradient. Different environmental conditions are reflected in the variations in the feature relevance across the cores. This study shows that density-based clustering provides valuable insights into chemical and physical structures of starless cores. It demonstrates that already small datasets of two or three molecules can yield meaningful results. This new approach revealed similarities in the clustering patterns of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CCH relative to c-C$_3$H$_2$, suggesting that c-C$_3$H$_2$ traces regions of lower density than to the other two molecules. This allowed for insight into the CH$_3$CCH peak in L1544, which appears to trace a landing point of chemically fresh gas that is accreted to the core, highlighting the impact of accretion processes on molecular distributions.",

        "abstract": "Gravitational-wave observations provide a unique window into the fundamental nature of massive objects. In particular, neutron star equations of state have been constrained due to the success of gravitational wave observatories. Recently, the possibility of detecting dark matter-admixed neutron stars via ground-based laser interferometry has been explored. Dark matter would impact the gravitational waveform of an inspiraling neutron star system through tidal parameters, namely the tidal deformability ($\\lambda$, incurring a phase shift to the frequency evolution of the signal. This phase shift would depend both on the percentage of dark matter within the star and its particle nature, e.g., bosonic or fermionic. Indirect detection of dark matter through admixture within neutron stars can provide insight into the neutron equation of state, as well as constraints on the density of dark matter in the universe. In this work, we introduce \\texttt{Darksuite}, a proposed extension of the \\lal{} software framework, designed to model the gravitational wave signatures of dark-matter-admixed neutron stars. This framework employs simulations from the two-fluid, generally relativistic Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, wherein one fluid is ordinary nuclear matter and the other is dark matter. We demonstrate interpolation of values from a bank of simulations, enabling the study of binary systems where at least one component may be a dark-matter-admixed neutron star. By leveraging existing methodologies within \\lal{} for tidal phase corrections and supplementing them with dark matter effects, \\texttt{Darksuite} provides a means to generate and analyze gravitational waveforms for these exotic systems.",

Both the gauge-sourced power spectrum and the bispectrum exhibit a strong blue tilt due to our choice of an $\\alpha$-attractor inflaton potential. We provide fitting functions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that accurately reproduce these statistics across a wide range of scales and coupling strengths. While our fitting function for the bispectrum has a separable form, results from high-resolution simulations demonstrate that the full shape is not separable. Thus, our simulations generate realizations of primordial curvature perturbations with nontrivial correlators that cannot be generated using standard techniques for primordial non-Gaussianity. We derive bounds on the axion-gauge coupling strength based on the bispectrum constraints from the cosmic microwave background, demonstrating a new method for constraining inflationary primordial non-Gaussianity by simulating the nonlinear dynamics.",

Utilizing archival submillimeter continuum data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array survey of Class 0 and I protostars at a 0.''1 resolution, we identified 38 dense cores hosting single protostars and 15 cores hosting binary or multiple systems. We measured the dense cores properties with the Herschel dust temperature, Nobeyama 45m N$_2$H$^+$ J=1-0, and JCMT polarization data. Our results reveal that the dense cores hosting binary/multiple systems exhibit significantly higher density and Mach number compared to those hosting single protostars, while there are no correlations between the occurrence of fragmentation and the energy ratios of turbulence and magnetic field to gravity. Our results suggest that the higher density and supersonic turbulence of the dense cores can lead to local collapse and fragmentation to form binary/multiple systems, while the magnetic field has limited influence on fragmentation in the dense cores in Orion A.",

        "abstract": "The dynamics of star forming gas can be affected by many physical processes, such as turbulence, gravity, supernova explosions, and magnetic fields. In this paper, we investigate several nearby star forming regions (Orion, Upper Sco, Taurus, and Perseus) for kinematic imprints of these influences on the newly formed stars. Using Gaia DR3 astrometry and APOGEE DR17 radial velocities, we compute first-order velocity structure functions (VSFs) of young stars in galactic Cartesian coordinates in both 6D (3D positions and 3D velocities) and 4D (3D positions and each 1D velocity) to identify signatures of turbulence and anisotropic motion. We also construct 3D and 1D radial velocity profiles to identify coherent expansion trends, and compare stellar proper motions to plane-of-sky magnetic field orientations in Taurus and Perseus. We find that the VSFs are mildly anisotropic, with slightly different amplitudes, slopes, or features in different directions in several groups, but in general, they are all consistent with Larson's Relation at intermediate length scales, especially in less compact groups. In several cases, the VSFs exhibit features suggestive of local energy injection from supernovae. Radial velocity profiles reveal clear anisotropic expansion in multiple groups, with the most extreme cases corresponding to those with the most anisotropic VSFs. In Perseus, we find that the motions of young stars are preferentially perpendicular to the local magnetic field. We find multiple, overlapping causes in each group for the observed kinematics. Our findings support that young stars remember more than just the turbulent state of their natal clouds.",

        "abstract": "Cosmic birefringence, arising from a potential parity-violating interaction between cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons and evolving pseudo-scalar fields such as axion-like particles, can rotate the CMB polarization plane and induce an effective correlation between the CMB $E$- and $B$-mode polarization. In this work, we introduce a hybrid internal linear combination (ILC) method that combines both $E$- and $B$-mode frequency maps into the component separation pipeline, enabling the disentanglement of correlated and uncorrelated components of CMB polarization in the presence of cosmic birefringence and instrumental polarization angle miscalibration. We derive an analytic linear relation connecting the birefringence-induced correlated component of the CMB $E$- (or $B$-) mode field to the full CMB $B$- (or $E$-) mode field convolved with a modulating field. By performing linear regression between these fields across multiple sky patches, we directly estimate the birefringence angle at the field level. This allows us to distinguish cosmic birefringence from polarization angle miscalibration and foreground contamination, as the ILC responds differently to achromatic cosmic birefringence and chromatic systematic effects, with its weights projecting spatial or harmonic dependence only onto the latter. This non-parametric, field-level approach provides a novel way to probe cosmic birefringence directly in real space. When applied to realistic simulations of the forthcoming LiteBIRD satellite mission, our method yields constraints that are competitive with, and complementary to, existing power spectrum-based analyses. When applied to Planck Release 4 (PR4) data, we find a birefringence angle of $\\beta = 0.32^\\circ \\pm 0.12^\\circ$, a $2.7\\sigma$ detection that remains robust against varying sky fractions.",

        "abstract": "V Sge is a peculiar, highly luminous long-period (12.34h) binary star that can display a super-soft X-ray emitting component when in the faint phase of its V~ 10-13mag variability range. Apparently undergoing Eddington-limited accretion from its more massive secondary, it is in a very rare, short-lived evolutionary phase towards the double degenerate channel. Its complex and highly variable optical emission features, from Balmer and Heii to high-ionisation lines, including strong fluorescence features, have been challenging to interpret, especially given the absence of any absorption lines associated with photospheric features from either stellar component. With the detailed properties of V Sge, especially the donor, still controversial, we undertook a VLT/X-Shooter campaign over three months in 2023, obtaining high S/N, high resolution spectra that revealed multiple components in both high- and low-ionisation lines. This allows us to track V Sge's principal emitting regions via Doppler tomography, obtaining new insights into high accretion-rate dynamics. In particular, we identify a stationary, double-peaked emission core which we interpret as a circumbinary ring, analogous to SS433. This enables us to derive limits on the system masses. Furthermore, we find very broad emission-line wings whose mean velocity can vary over hundreds of kilometres per second on timescales of decades, yet ``flip'' between states in <1 week. We show that the super-soft X-ray source interpretation is able to account for these and other observational attributes significantly better than the hot binary model, concluding that V Sge could be one of the brightest known Galactic super-soft sources.",

Traditional spectrum classification tools use template matching techniques (Blondin & Tonry 2007) and require significant human supervision. Two deep learning spectral classifiers, DASH (Muthukrishna et al. 2019) and SNIascore (Fremling et al. 2021) define the state of the art, but SNIascore is a binary classifier devoted to maximizing the purity of the SN Ia-norm sample, while DASH is no longer maintained and the original work suffers from contamination of multi-epoch spectra in the training and test sets. We have explored several neural network architectures in order to create a new automated method for classifying SN subtypes, settling on an attention-based model we call ABC-SN. We benchmark our results against an updated version of DASH, thus providing the community with an up-to-date general purpose SN classifier. Our dataset includes ten different SN subtypes including subtypes of SN Ia, core collapse and interacting SNe. We find that ABC-SN outperforms DASH, and we discuss the possibility that modern SN spectra datasets contain label noise which limit the performance of all classifiers.",

In this work, we revisit this picture in global disk models and various magnetic field topologies and generalise it to non-axisymmetric instabilities like the Super-Alfv\\'enic Rotational Instability (SARI). We use the open-source \\texttt{Legolas} software to quantify all complex-valued linear eigenfunctions for the (near-)eigenmodes and visualise the resulting spatio-temporal variations in real space in a manner that can be compared to direct numerical simulations of disks. The field perturbations are fundamentally different between the (axisymmetric) MRI and the novel, ultra-localised SARI modes, which bear some resemblance to spiral modes in galaxies but differ in important ways. We use a combined numerical-analytical approach to study the polarization of the magnetic and velocity field perturbations. Finally, we compare disks of differing magnetic topology where many linear modes are merely superposed to recreate a visual impression of `turbulent' fields and quantify the resulting stresses. We find that even superposed, still linearly growing SARI modes can already provide the needed effective viscosity-related alpha-values invoked for angular momentum transport. 3D views on the magnetic field perturbations show that SARI modes of opposite azimuthal mode number may naturally introduce plasmoid and toroidal flux-tube like field deformations.",

Improving the modeling of high-energy pion interactions is essential for addressing the muon puzzle-the observed deficit of muons in simulations compared to indirect experimental estimates. As collider experiments cannot directly probe these interactions, we propose a novel measurement approach using muon bundles detected in deep-underground water Cherenkov detectors, such as IceCube and KM3NeT. This method aims to constrain the pion-air inelastic cross section, thereby reducing uncertainties in air shower simulations and advancing our understanding of cosmic ray interactions.",

In this paper, we perform general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of low angular momentum accretion flows onto a BH with different BH spins to investigate the accretion dynamics near the central BH region. The simulation results show the standard and normal evolution (SANE) regime in all cases. In particular, we report the formation and persistence of standing shocks in low-angular-momentum accretion flows using multi (two and three)-dimensional GRMHD simulations for the first time. Previous studies did not detect such stable standing shock structures, making our findings a significant advancement in this field. The finding of shock dynamics can be further associated with some radiation features, such as flares observed in Sgr~A$^\\ast$ and quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signals detected in some XRBs and AGNs.",

        "abstract": "The MAGIC telescopes, located at Observatorio El Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma, Spain) are two Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes observing the Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays. They are run by an international collaboration composed of over 40 institutions from 12 countries. The first telescope was inaugurated in October 2003. The commissioning of the second finished in 2008. The MAGIC telescopes were designed to lower the energies to which ground based telescopes had access as well as to be able to point to any direction in the sky in less than 25 seconds. The former required the large reflective surface of 17 meters as well as an effort to optimise the mirror reflectivity and photo sensor sensitivity. The latter was achieved by minimising the weight of the full instrument using for instance carbon fibre reinforced plastic tubes for the mirror frame. The sensitivity of the MAGIC telescopes have been improving over the years thanks to hardware upgrades as well as new analysis techniques, which allowed the collaboration to keep a rich scientific program. The discovery of VHE emission from Gamma Ray Bursts and pulsars have called for a revision of the models that explain the production of gamma rays there. Both the observation of sources in flaring state as well as a systematic monitoring of sources have provided valuable data to better understand astrophysical sources both in our Galaxy and outside it. Relevant constraints on fundamental quantities like dark matter cross-section, quantum gravity scale and density of extragalactic background light have also been extracted from the observations.",

        "abstract": "Context: SN 2024ggi is a Type II supernova (SN) discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 (D $\\approx6.7\\pm0.d$ Mpc) on 2024 April 03.21 UT. Its proximity enabled a detailed investigation of the SN's properties and its progenitor star. This work focuses on the optical evolution of SN 2024ggi at the nebular phase. Aims: We investigate the progenitor properties and possible asymmetries in the ejecta by studying the nebular phase evolution between days 287 and 400 after the explosion. Methods: We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi during the nebular phase, obtained with the Las Campanas and Gemini South Observatories. Four nebular spectra were taken at 287, 288, 360, and 396 days post-explosion, supplemented by late-time $uBVgri$-band photometry spanning $320-400$ days. The analysis of the nebular emission features is performed to probe ejecta asymmetries. Based on the [O I] flux and [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, and comparisons with spectra models from the literature, we arrive to an estimate of the progenitor mass. Additionally, we construct the bolometric light curve from optical photometry and near-infrared data to derive the synthesized nickel mass. Results: Our analysis suggests a progenitor zero-age-main-sequence mass between $12-15 M_\\odot$. The late-time bolometric light curve is consistent with a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.05-0.06 M_\\odot$. The line profiles exhibit only minor changes over the observed period and suggest a roughly symmetrical ejecta, with a possible clump of oxygen-rich material moving towards the observer. No signatures of circumstellar material interaction are detected up to 400 days after the explosion.",

        "abstract": "Cataclysmic variable (CVs) are close interacting binaries in which a white dwarf accretes materials from a low mass main sequence companion. CVs can experience nova eruptions due to low mass transfer rates. In the standard theory of CV evolution, the ejected materials during nova eruptions are assumed to leave the system in the form of fast, isotropic, optically thick winds, which predicts that novae only result in positive variation (expansion) of orbital period (i.e. positive $\\Delta P$). In addition, the angular momentum losses (magnetic braking and gravitational radiation) only predicts a steady long-term decay in the orbital period of CVs, i.e. $\\dot P$ is negative. Interestingly, an observation lasting over 30 years reveals positive and negative values for both $\\Delta P$ and $\\dot P$ in CVs, strongly conflicting with the standard evolutionary patterns. However, it cannot be excluded that these observations originate from short-term phenomena caused by nova eruptions because of a short timescale of observations. In this paper, we model the effect of instantaneous nova eruptions on the evolution of CVs, considering three mechanisms associated with mass loss in nova eruptions, including fast wind, Frank jet and binary-driven mass loss. By assuming that the observed $\\Delta P$ and $\\dot P$ are dominated by short-term phenomena, our results show that the binary-driven mass loss can explain almost all of the observations of normal CVs. However, the Frank jet may be needed for some of long-period CVs with evolved companions.",

This work aims to determine how the contribution of AGN affects the most used morphological parameters down to the redshift of z~2 in COSMOS-like conditions. We use a sample of > 2000 local non-active galaxies, with a well-known visual morphological classification, and add an AGN as an unresolved component that contributes to the total galaxy flux with 5%-75%. We moved all the galaxies to lower magnitudes (higher redshifts) to map the conditions in the COSMOS field, and we measured six morphological parameters. The greatest impact on morphology occurs when considering the combined effect of magnitude, redshift and AGN, with spiral galaxies being the most affected. In general, all the concentration parameters change significantly if the AGN contribution is > 25% and the magnitude > 23. We find that the GINI coefficient is the most stable in terms of AGN and magnitude/redshift, followed by the M20, Conselice-Bershady (CCON), and finally the Abraham (CABR) concentration indexes. We find that, when using morphological parameters, the combination of CABR, CCON and asymmetry is the most effective in classifying active galaxies at high-redshift, followed by the combination of CABR and GINI.",

We simulate the pre-SN mass eruption and the resulting confined CSM using the open-source code CHIPS, and follow the subsequent evolution of the SN ejecta and its interaction with the CSM. We show that a cold dense shell (CDS) is formed at the radiative shock under a wide range of conditions and later undergoes rapid adiabatic cooling during free expansion, leading to efficient dust condensation. The resulting dust mass ranges from $\\sim10^{-3}\\,M_\\odot$ to $0.1\\,M_\\odot$, depending on the mass and spatial extent of the CSM. We further calculate the infrared (IR) emission from the newly formed dust and find broad consistency with observations of SN~1998S. Notably, the IR light curve exhibits a rapid rise within $\\lesssim10\\,{\\rm d}$, closely resembling that of kilonovae (KNe). This suggests that dust emission powered by confined CSM interaction may be also discovered in KN searches. Moreover, the high-density environment of the CDS may allow dust grains to grow to larger sizes, enhancing their survivability against destruction by reverse shocks propagating from the interstellar medium at later times.",

The absence of dark matter annihilation due to its asymmetric nature leads to ADM accumulation in the NS core, potentially reaching densities sufficient to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit and trigger its gravitational collapse into a black hole (BH), eventually consuming the NS from within. Therefore, the existence and observation of old neutron stars provides a means to constrain the properties of ADM. We revisit previous constraints on the mass and scattering cross section off neutrons of fermionic ADM across a class of models. We critically examine common simplifying approximations used in the literature to derive these limits. Our analysis includes improved treatments of dark matter capture, thermalization, BH formation, accretion, and evaporation.

This article presents a description of the Ricochet experimental installation and the detector performance achieved during its commissioning with a mini-CryoCube module consisting of three 42-gram germanium cryogenic calorimeters. The baseline resolutions and background levels are reported both during reactor-on and reactor-off periods, and as noise mitigation techniques were improved. A baseline resolution of 40 eV electron equivalent was achieved for the ionization channel after setup improvements, and the phonon channel resolutions ranged from 50 to 80 eV of total phonon energy. In the energy region from 2 to 7 keV, a nuclear recoil rate of 15(2) events/(kg day keV) is measured during the reactor-off period selecting events in coincidence with muon veto signals. This rate is in agreement with the cosmogenic neutron rate calculated from GEANT4 simulations. After the rejection of events in coincidence with signals in the muon veto detectors, a combined 90% C.L. limit on the nuclear recoil background of < 9 events/(kg day keV) is obtained in that energy region during the reactor-on period, which is compatible with our GEANT4 model calculation corresponding to a total rate of 5 events/(kg day keV). The sensitivity of this analysis was however found to be limited by a surface event contamination which is currently being addressed by the Ricochet Collaboration with upgraded detectors.",

        "abstract": "The exponential-tail behaviours of the probability density function (PDF) of the primordial curvature perturbation are confirmed in the mild-waterfall variants of hybrid inflation with the use of the stochastic formalism of inflation. On top of these tails, effective upper bounds on the curvature perturbation are also observed, corresponding to the exact hilltop trajectory during the waterfall phase. We find that in the model where the leading and higher-order terms in the expansion of the inflaton potential around the critical point are fine-tuned to balance, this upper bound can be significantly reduced, even smaller than the primordial black hole (PBH) threshold, as a novel perturbation-reduction mechanism than the one proposed in Ref. [1]. It makes PBH formation much difficult compared to the Gaussian or exponential-tail approximation. We also introduce Johnson's $S_U$-distribution as a useful fitting function for the PDF. It reveals a nonlinear mapping between the Gaussian field and the curvature perturbation, which enables us to apply the peak theory to estimate the PBH function.",

We perform a series of Particle-In-Cell studies in one and two dimensions in order to determine the stability conditions for such a shock and the mechanisms which sustain its growth. Building on our previous simulations, which established that these shocks are initially mediated by the Weibel instability before becoming Alfv\\'enic, we demonstrate that the shock is sustained by self-generated Alfv\\'en waves overtaking the shock in the upstream plasma. As a result growth is only possible when the guiding magnetic field strength, and hence Alfv\\'en speed, is sufficiently small, $\\omega_c \\lesssim 0.4$ (in normalized units). Furthermore the production of the waves in the upstream is dependent on a resonance between the Alfv\\'en wave mode and the thermal noise in the plasma, which is inhibited at high magnetization. This explains the conditional absence of this type of shock identified previously.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the cosmological implications of a novel definition of field theory vacuum energy. The free field Hamiltonian represented as an ensemble of oscillators (in the Fourier space) usually implies the presence of mass scale for these oscillators, which in quantum field theory is of little importance since quantum energy spectrum of oscillator is mass independent. This mass scale, however, may be interesting due to its possible gravitational implications. Since black hole physics puts an upper limit on the total energy within a given region, one obtains constraint on the number of field oscillators. If the mass scale for field oscillators is set by the IR cutoff, then this number saturates the black hole entropy bound. Following this reasoning, one derives various kinds of dark energy models that maybe interesting for further study.",

The shock produces a strong electromagnetic precursor that propagates into the upstream plasma, which is initially threaded by a uniform background magnetic field. We show that the filamentation instability breaks the precursor into radiation filaments parallel to the shock normal. The transverse scale of the filaments is of the order of a few plasma skin depths. In the shock frame, the bulk Lorentz factor of the upstream plasma is significantly reduced inside the radiation filaments. Then, the instability produces a relativistic shear flow with strong velocity gradients on kinetic scales. The velocity gradients distort the background magnetic field lines, and generate a magnetic field component parallel to the shock normal that reverses across each radiation filament, a configuration that could trigger magnetic reconnection in the upstream plasma. These effects may accelerate particles before the plasma enters the shock.",

To process the enormous amounts of data produced by these telescopes, scalable software pipelines are required. This paper helps address this by proposing a framework that allows for decentralized radio-interferometric image reconstruction, parallelizing by spatial frequency. This is achieved by creating pseudo-full-resolution problems for each node by using the local visibilities together with previous major cycle reconstructed images from the other nodes. We apply the proposed framework to both multiscale CLEAN and sparsity regularized convex reconstruction and compare them to their serial counterparts across four different data sets of varying properties in the context of two visibility partitions. We found that the parallelization framework allows for significantly improved reconstruction times for images of similar quality. This was especially the case for our larger datasets where we were able to achieve close to the optimal $2\\times$ speedup.",

Extending the IAU conventions, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) metric that retains all contributions above a fractional threshold of 5x10^{-18} and timing terms above 0.1 ps by expanding the lunar gravity field to spherical-harmonic degree l=9 with Love number variations and including external tidal and inertial multipoles to the octupole. We derive closed-form mappings among TCB, TCG, TT, TCL and TL, yielding proper-to-coordinate time transformations and two-way time-transfer corrections at sub-picosecond accuracy. We evaluate secular rate constants and periodic perturbations arising from kinematic dilation, lunar monopole and multipoles, Earth tides and gravitomagnetic effects for clocks on the lunar surface, in low lunar orbits, at the Earth-Moon L1 point and in near-rectilinear halo orbits. Our analysis demonstrates that harmonics through l=9 and tides through l=8 are required to achieve 5x10^{-18} fractional stability, supporting sub-picosecond clock synchronization and centimeter-level navigation in cislunar space. This framework underpins high-precision time and frequency transfer, relativistic geodesy, quantum communication links and fundamental physics experiments beyond low Earth orbit.",

There are two main mechanisms for the formation of runaway stars, i.e., the binary-supernova scenario (BSS) and the dynamical ejection scenario (DES). Investigating the binary fraction of runaway stars is an important step in further exploring the relative significance of the two mechanisms. We analyzed the binary fraction of 203 Galactic B-type runaway stars identified in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope Data Release 8 database. Our analysis of radial velocity variations in the runaway star sample reveals an observed spectroscopic binary fraction of $5.4\\%\\pm 1.6\\%$, representing the proportion of objects that exhibit statistically significant variations in radial velocity with amplitudes larger than $\\rm 16~km~s^{-1}$. We employed a Monte Carlo method to correct for observational biases and determined an intrinsic binary fraction of $27\\%\\pm 8\\%$. The period and mass ratio distributions that best reproduce the observation are $f(P)\\propto P^{-5.7}$ for $1\\leq P\\leq 1000$ days, and $f(q)\\propto q^{-3.6}$ for $0.1\\leq q\\leq 1.0$, indicating a preference for binaries with shorter periods and less massive companions compared to a uniform distribution. The intrinsic binary fraction, in combination with previous studies on the binary fractions of runaway stars formed by the BSS and the DES, implies that both scenarios contribute comparably to the formation of Galactic B-type runaway stars, where the ratio of the BSS to the DES is 0.86.",

With these strategies, the Laseroptik coating achieves an equal power reflectivity of 51% at 46 deg angle of incidence, and zero phase shift between both polarisations at 44.25 deg angle of incidence. The Optoman coating achieves power reflectivities of 49% for s-polarisation and 51% for p-polarisation with a differential phase shift around 5 deg largely independent of the angle of incidence.",

A total of 55 sources are clearly detected in at least one X-ray band, and we set stringent upper limits on the X-ray fluxes of the remaining eight sources. In combination with rest-frame ultraviolet-optical spectroscopic data for these sources, we assess whether X-rays can provide a robust accretion-rate indicator for quasars, particularly at the highest accessible redshifts. We utilize a recently modified H$\\beta$-based Eddington luminosity ratio estimator, as well as the C IV $\\lambda$1549 emission-line parameter space to investigate trends and correlations with the optical-X-ray spectral slope ($\\alpha_{\\mathrm{ox}}$) and the effective hard-X-ray power-law photon index ($\\Gamma$). We find that $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ does not improve current accretion-rate estimates based on H$\\beta$ or C IV. Instead, within the limitations of our sample, we confirm previous findings that the C IV parameter space may be a better indicator of the accretion rate up to $z\\sim3.5$. We also find that the average $\\Gamma$ values for a small subset of our sources, as well as the average $\\Gamma$ value in different groupings of our sources, are consistent with their respective relatively high Eddington luminosity ratios. Deeper X-ray observations of our X-ray-detected sources are needed for measuring $\\Gamma$ accurately and testing whether this parameter can serve as a robust, un-biased accretion-rate diagnostic.",

        "abstract": "Wavelength calibration is a key factor for high-resolution spectroscopic measurements for precision radial velocities. Hollow-cathode lamps (e.g., ThAr), absorption cells (e.g., iodine cell), dielectric coated Fabry-P\\'erot etalons and laser frequency combs have been implemented over the years for precise wavelength calibration and wavelength drift measurements. However, due to their various impediments as wavelength calibrators, investigations of alternative methods remain of prime interest. In this paper, we examined the feasibility of low-cost (~ $1000) commercially available solid fused silica etalon with a broadband metallic coating as a calibrator. We studied the behaviour for two cavity spacings (free spectral range of 1/cm and 0.5/cm) with temperature from theoretical derivation and experimental data. Our setup had a temperature stability of 0.8 mK for a calibrator system using an off-the-shelf dewar flask with active stabilisation. Our result from radial velocity drift measurements demonstrated that such a calibration system is capable of providing higher signal-to-noise calibration and better nightly drift measurement relative to ThAr in the wavelength range between 470 nm and 780 nm. A similar result has been previously found for Fabry-P\\'erot etalons, and although the metalon solution lacks the efficiency of an etalon, it does offers a cost-effective broadband solution, which should be less prone to aging relative to complex dielectric mirror coatings. Nonetheless, long-term monitoring is required to understand the metalon behaviour in detail.",

        "title": "Sulfur oxides tracing streamers and shocks at low mass protostellar disk-envelope interfaces",
        "abstract": "Accretion shocks are thought to play a crucial role in the early stages of star and planet formation, but their direct observational evidence remains elusive, particularly regarding the molecular tracers of these processes. In this work, we searched for features of accretion shocks by observing the emission of SO and SO$_2$ using ALMA in Band 6 towards nearby Class I protostars. We analyze the SO and SO$_2$ emission from Oph IRS 63, DK Cha, and L1527, which have different disk inclination angles, ranging from nearly face-on to edge-on. SO emission is found to be concentrated in rings at the centrifugal barriers of the infalling envelopes. These rings are projected onto the plane of the sky as ellipses or parallel slabs, depending on the inclination angles. Spiral-like streamers with SO emission are also common, with warm ($T_{\\rm ex} > 50$ K) and even hot ($T_{\\rm ex} \\gtrsim 100$ K) spots or segments of SO$_2$ observed near the centrifugal barriers. Inspired by these findings, we present a model that consistently explains the accretion shock traced by SO and SO$_2$, where the shock occurs primarily in two regions: (1) the centrifugal barriers, and (2) the surface of the disk-like inner envelope outside the centrifugal barrier. The outer envelope gains angular momentum through outflows, causing it to fall onto the midplane at or outside the centrifugal barrier, leading to a disk-like inner envelope that is pressure-confined by the accretion shock and moves in a rotating-and-infalling motion. We classify the streamers into two types--those in the midplane and those off the midplane. These streamers interact with the inner envelopes in different ways, resulting in different patterns of shocked regions. We suggest that the shock-related chemistry at the surfaces of the disk and the disk-like inner envelope warrants further special attention.",

        "abstract": "Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) with extremely red optical-to-infrared colors are often associated with intense starburst and AGN activity. Studying DOGs can provide insights into the processes that drive the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. However, the general DOG population is heterogeneous, spanning a wide range of evolutionary stages, and has X-ray obscuring column densities ($N_\\mathrm{H}$) covering low-to-high levels. In this work, we focus on seven high Eddington ratio DOGs ($\\log \\lambda_\\mathrm{Edd} \\gtrsim -0.5$) to examine their X-ray obscuration properties using new and archival X-ray observations. We confirm that these systems are generally heavily obscured, with 6/7 having $N_\\mathrm{H}\\gtrsim10^{23}~\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ and 3/7 having $N_\\mathrm{H}\\gtrsim10^{24}~\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. Based on the observed similarity with the rare Hot DOG population, we argue that both high-$\\lambda_\\mathrm{Edd}$ DOGs and Hot DOGs likely trace the post-merger phase during which AGNs are enshrouded by large columns of dust-rich material.",

We show that the equations of motion for null geodesics are separable and admit analytical treatment, whereas timelike geodesics are generally non-separable. Approximate analytical expressions for the photon sphere and the innermost stable circular orbit are derived via perturbative expansions in the magnetic field strength. We further explore the black hole shadow using both numerical and analytical methods, examining the effects of the magnetic field, the observer's inclination angle and radial position. Deviations from the standard Kerr shadow are quantified, and a physical interpretation is provided by introducing asymptotic regimes defined relative to the magnetic field strength.",

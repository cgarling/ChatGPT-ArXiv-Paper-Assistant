We acquired and present new Atacama Compact Array (ACA) $^{12}$CO($J$=1-0) data within our CHIMERA Survey project for the central region of Leo~T, a metal-poor ([M/H]$\\sim$-1.7) dwarf in the Milky Way (MW) outskirts. We identified three compact molecular clouds ($<13$ pc) with estimated upper limit virial masses of $M_{\\rm mol}$$\\sim$5$\\times10^{3}$ M$_{\\odot}$ each and a total of 1.4$\\pm$0.4$\\times$10$^{4}$ M$_{\\odot}$, corresponding to $\\sim\\!3\\%$ of the total gas mass.

All CO clouds are shifted ($\\sim$60 pc) from the stellar population centers, and only one cloud appears within the densest \\hi region. Two clouds have velocity offsets with the \\hi of $\\Delta v_{\\rm los}\\sim\\!+13$ km s$^{-1}$ being within twice the velocity dispersion ($\\Delta v_{\\rm los}/\\sigma_{\\rm HI,los}\\sim2$) and probably bound. However, the northern cloud is faster ($\\Delta v_{\\rm los}\\sim\\!+57$ km s$^{-1}$); our models with low halo masses ($M_{\\rm h}\\! \\lesssim \\!10^9$ M$_{\\odot}$) result in unbound orbits, suggesting that this material is likely being expelled from the dwarf, providing evidence for molecular gas depletion. These properties reveal a perturbed dynamics intertwined with star formation processes in low-mass dwarf galaxies, supporting a scenario of episodic bursts until they are fully quenched by the MW environment.",

Despite extensive experimental efforts, no direct or indirect detection of dark matter particles has been confirmed.

In this work, we investigate the implications of a specific non-local gravity (NLG) theory, which modifies General Relativity by introducing non-local effects that manifest as an effective dark matter component. We analyze the velocity dispersion profiles of eight classical dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies - Carina, Draco, Fornax, Leo I, Leo II, Sculptor, Sextans, and Ursa Minor - to test the predictions of NLG. Using the Jeans equation, we model the kinematics of these galaxies and perform a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to constrain the parameters of the NLG kernel chosen for our analysis. Our results indicate that NLG might successfully reproduce the observed kinematics of dSph galaxies without requiring particle dark matter, providing constraints on the scale-dependent modifications to gravity that are compatible with previous studies in the literature. However, a parameter inconsistency remains in the cases of Fornax and Sextans galaxies that requires further attention.",

        "abstract": "The globular cluster Palomar 5 (Pal 5) is in the process of being tidally shredded as it orbits the Milky Way. Its core is currently at a heliocentric distance of ~21 kpc, near apogalacticon (~18 kpc), and it reaches ~5-7 kpc at perigalacticon. Pal 5's leading and trailing arms stretch over 20 degrees on the sky, making them sensitive probes of the Milky Way's mass distribution. In this work, we search for red giant members of Pal 5 using spectroscopic data from APOGEE DR17 and photometric and astrometric data from Gaia DR3. Based on position and proper motion, we identify eight members of Pal 5: six in the core and two in the stream. The clustering algorithm HDBSCAN finds these same eight. We then use chemical tagging with APOGEE abundances to search for additional members across five APOGEE fields overlapping Pal 5. While several dozen candidates are identified, most deviate (some significantly) from known kinematic and color-magnitude trends, suggesting that they are less likely to be true members. We estimate the expected number of giants in the APOGEE pointings based on the area and stellar mass of the streams. Given APOGEE's limiting magnitude, we find that few, if any, new giants are expected, especially if the stream is more diffuse at these locations. Our results support the presence of density variations in Pal 5's tidal streams, consistent with earlier studies attributing such features to baryonic perturbers in the Milky Way, dark matter subhaloes, or interactions with passing globular clusters.",

        "abstract": "We analysed the cooling of white dwarfs in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae using deep observations from the Hubble Space Telescope that resolve the white dwarf cooling sequence to late enough cooling times that the white dwarf core has begun to crystallise and the envelope has become convectively coupled to the core. At such late cooling times, both the state of matter assumed for ions in the treatment of element diffusion and the thickness of the outer H envelope become important considerations for modelling white dwarf cooling. Using the stellar evolution software Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we created a suite of white dwarf cooling models for different treatments of element diffusion, as well as different values of the white dwarf mass and H envelope thickness parameters. Three different diffusion scenarios were considered: i) the standard MESA implementation, which implicitly uses an ideal gas approximation for the ions, ii) a custom modified implementation that accounts for non-ideal gas effects, and iii) no diffusion. An unbinned likelihood analysis was performed to compare these cooling models to the observations. This work both constrains the values of parameters important for modelling white dwarf cooling and tests the implementation of element diffusion in MESA to late cooling times. We find that models with thicker H envelopes are preferred and that the standard MESA diffusion treatment produces a best-fitting model that well reproduces the cumulative white dwarf luminosity functions of the observations.",

In Romulus25, classical LSB galaxies are predominantly formed through major mergers in which the secondary galaxy is co-rotating and aligned with the primary galaxy's gas disk and/or has above average orbital angular momentum at infall. The merger product is a high spin galaxy in which star formation is spread out and inefficient, allowing the galaxy to build up a large supply of relatively unenriched gas. The star formation rates of LSB galaxies are nearly constant over time, leading to stellar populations that are, on average, slightly older and therefore optically redder than those of similar HSB galaxies. However, because LSB galaxies are diffuse and metal-poor, they have very little internal reddening, causing them to appear bluer than HSB galaxies. We also find that, when compared to the bulges of HSB galaxies, the bulges of LSB galaxies are similar in mass, but are lower surface brightness, redder, and more diffuse on average. Despite these differences, classical LSB galaxies are part of the continuum of the galaxy population in Romulus25, constituting one of many evolutionary paths.",

        "abstract": "The active suppression of star formation in galaxies is critical in preventing the growth of overly massive systems and explaining the formation of present-day elliptical galaxies. We present a high-resolution, spatially-resolved multiwavelength study of two z ~ 0.7 massive post-starburst galaxies, SDSS J1448+1010 and SDSS J2258+2313, from the SQuIGGLE survey (Studying Quenching in Intermediate-z Galaxies: Gas, anguLar momentum, and Evolution), providing new insights into the role of mergers in driving quenching. ALMA CO(2-1) observations show that both galaxies removed ~50% of their molecular gas into extended tidal tails, spanning up to 65 kpc, following recent mergers. HST WFC3 imaging and grism spectroscopy show that while SDSS J1448+1010 exhibits Halpha emission in its northern tidal tail consistent with ongoing star formation, SDSS J2258+2313 lacks detectable star-forming activity outside the central galaxy. VLA 6 GHz continuum data reveal compact radio emission in SDSS J2258+2313, while SDSS J1448+1010 hosts small radio jets indicative of AGN activity. Both galaxies retain substantial molecular gas reservoirs in their central regions that appear more turbulent than 'normal' star-forming galaxies, likely contributing to the observed low star formation rates in the hosts. Despite similarities in their cold gas content and tidal features the galaxies are distinct from each other in their star formation, gas-star alignment, and radio morphology, highlighting the complexity of tidal gas removal as a quenching mechanism at intermediate redshifts.",

        "abstract": "Turbulence and magnetic fields are components of the interstellar medium and are interconnected through plasma processes. In particular, the magnetic flux transport in the presence of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is an essential factor for understanding star formation. The theory of Reconnection Diffusion (RD), based on statistics of Alfv\\'enic turbulence, predicts a dependence of the diffusion coefficient of the magnetic field on the Alfv\\'enic Mach number $M_A$. However, this theory does not consider the effects of compressibility which are important in the regime of supersonic MHD turbulence. In this work, we measure the diffusion coefficient of magnetic fields in sub-Alfv\\'enic MHD turbulence, with different sonic Mach numbers $M_S$. We perform numerical simulations of forced turbulence in periodic domains from the incompressible limit to the supersonic regime. We introduce two methods to extract the diffusion coefficient, based on the analysis of tracer particles. Our results confirm the RD assumption regarding the correspondence between the diffusion of magnetic field and that of fluid Lagrangian particles. The measured diffusion rate provided by incompressible turbulence agrees with the suppression predicted by the RD theory in the presence of strong magnetic fields: $D \\propto M_A^3$. Our simulations also indicate an increase in RD efficiency when the turbulence is compressible. The dependency on $M_A$ and $M_S$ from the simulations can be described by the relation $D \\propto M_A^\\alpha$, where $\\alpha(M_S) \\approx 3/(1 + M_S)$. This quantitative characterization of $D$ is critical for modeling star formation in turbulent molecular clouds and evaluating the efficiency of this transport compared to other mechanisms.",

The search is based on far ultra-violet redshift priors from HST and FUSE, and it has resulted in the identification of 34 possible O VII and O VIII absorption-line systems at the 99% confidence level, out of a search in 1,224 systems with fixed redshift priors. Of these, 7 O VII and 8 O VIII systems pass additional screening criteria and are deemed to be associated with the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). We find that the cosmological baryon density associated with these possible detections is consistent with the value required to solve the missing baryons problem. Specifically, we find that $\\Omega_{WHIM,X} /\\Omega_b = 0.83\\pm^{3.99}_{0.62}$ from the O VII lines, at the 68% level of confidence (assuming 20% Solar abundances and 100% ionization fraction), or separately $\\Omega_{WHIM,X} /\\Omega_b = 0.79\\pm^{3.08}_{0.50}$ from the O VIII lines (assuming 20% Solar abundances 50% ionization fraction). We also conducted an extensive analysis of systematic errors affecting these estimates, and provided evidence of the association between the detected X-ray absorption line systems with known filaments of SDSS galaxies. The results of this analysis therefore contributes to the characterization of the missing baryons and it indicates that they are in fact associated with the high-temperature portion of the warm-hot intergalactic medium, and possibly with large-scale WHIM filaments traced by galaxies, as consistently predicted by numerical simulations and by other independent probes.",

We obtain quasi-simultaneous observations in five bands (1-18 GHz) for each source. We find peaked spectral energy distributions, indicative of self-absorbed synchrotron emission. While all four sources have risen significantly over the past ~20 years in the 1-2 GHz band, two also show clear recent flares in the 2-4 GHz band. These sources are less luminous than typical peaked spectrum radio AGN. It remains unclear whether these sources are low luminosity analogs of the peaked radio AGN from accreted gas, or driven by tidal disruption events with missed optical flares.

Here, we model the spectral energy distributions of Population III stars to explore how these key quantities are affected by the initial mass and rotation of Population III stars given a wide range of models for the evolution of these stars. Our results indicate that rotating Population III stars that evolve to effective temperatures $\\sim 2\\times 10^5$ K could potentially give rise to a very strong HeII 1640 emission line in the spectra from primordial star clusters, without requiring stellar masses of $\\gtrsim 100\\ \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ indicated by previous models for non-rotating Population III stars. At the same time, the observable impact on 21-cm signatures from cosmic dawn and epoch of reionization from our set of rotating stars that evolve to $\\sim 2\\times 10^5$ K are modest, and produce potentially detectable features in the global 21-cm signal and 21-cm power spectrum for high Population III star formation efficiencies only.",

        "abstract": "The Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization 21 cm Signal (EDGES) has reported evidence for an absorption feature in the sky-averaged radio background near 78 MHz. A cosmological interpretation of this signal corresponds to absorption of 21 cm photons by neutral hydrogen at $z \\sim 17$. The large depth of the signal has been shown to require an excess radio background above the CMB and/or non-standard cooling processes in the IGM. Here, we explore the plausibility of a scenario in which the EDGES signal is back-lit by an excess radio background sourced from a population of radio-loud AGN at high redshift. These AGN could also explain the unexpected abundance of UV-bright objects observed at $z > 10$ by JWST. We find that producing enough radio photons to explain the EDGES depth requires that nearly all high-$z$ UV-bright objects down to $M_{\\mathrm{UV}} \\gtrsim -15$ are radio-loud AGN and that the UV density of such objects declines by at most 1.5 orders of magnitude between $z = $10 and 20. In addition, the fraction of X-ray photons escaping these objects must be $\\lesssim 1\\%$ of their expected intrinsic production rate to prevent the absorption signal being washed out by early IGM pre-heating. Reproducing the sharp boundaries of the absorption trough and its flat bottom requires that the UV luminosity function, the fraction of UV light produced by AGN, and the X-ray escape fraction have fine-tuned redshift dependence. We conclude that radio-loud AGN are an unlikely (although physically possible) candidate to explain EDGES because of the extreme physical properties required for them to do so.",

        "abstract": "The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered high luminosity galaxies that appear to be \"too many\" and \"too massive\" compared to predictions of the Standard LCDM cosmology, suggesting that star formation in the early universe is more rapid than previously anticipated. In this paper we examine in detail the following three effects which can instead provide alternative explanations for these observations: (1) a \"top heavy\" initial mass function (IMF) for the stars, (2) a variety of star formation histories (constant, exponentially decreasing, and peaked star formation rates), and (3) a variety of initial metallicities. Due to any of these three effects, galaxies of a given luminosity in JWST may be interpreted as having a larger stellar mass than they actually do. Our results are obtained using the Pegase stellar population code, and are presented as the ratio of the modified star formation efficiency relative to the fiducial one (which uses a Salpeter IMF and constant star formation rate). As an example, if the high-mass end of the IMF goes as $M^{-1.35}$, the star formation efficiency and inferred stellar galactic mass could be lower by a factor of $\\sim 10$ than in the fiducial case. Our examination (keeping the star formation rate constant) of a top-heavy IMF with slope $\\alpha$ leads to a simple relation that is a good approximation to the numerical results, $\\epsilon(\\alpha) \\approx \\epsilon_{\\rm fid}e^{2.66(\\alpha -2.35)}$. Since there are more low mass galaxies than high mass galaxies, these effects may result in a large number of seemingly overly massive galaxies compared to the expectations. Thus, the effects studied in this paper may explain both puzzling observations regarding high luminosity galaxies in JWST: the apparently overly massive galaxies as well as the profusion of apparently high mass galaxies.",

Our goal was to detect pulsars that might have been missed in the original survey processing. Of the original 43842 pointings, 34869 pointings were archived, along with 440 additional pointings for confirmation or timing. We processed all of these archived data and detected 359 known pulsars: 265 of these were detected in the original survey, while an additional 94 currently known pulsars were detected in our reprocessing. A few among those 94 pulsars are highly accelerated binary pulsars. Furthermore, we detected 5 more pulsars with DMs higher than the original survey thresholds, as well as 6 more pulsars below the nominal survey sensitivity threshold (from the original survey beams with longer integrations). We missed detection of 33 (of the 298) pulsars detected in the original survey, in part because portions of the survey data were missing in the archive and our early stage candidate sifting method. We discovered one new pulsar in the re-analysis, PSR J0540$-$69 which has a spin period of 0.909 s and resides in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This new pulsar appeared in three PKS70 beams and one additional L-band observation that targeted the LMC pulsar PSR B0540$-$69.

Existing reconstruction methods, such as the CLEAN algorithm or proximal optimisation approaches, are iterative in nature, necessitating a large amount of compute. These methods either provide no uncertainty quantification or require large computational overhead to do so. Learned reconstruction methods have shown promise in providing efficient and high quality reconstruction. In this article we explore the use of generative neural networks that enable efficient approximate sampling of the posterior distribution for high quality reconstructions with uncertainty quantification. Our RI-GAN framework, builds on the regularised conditional generative adversarial network (rcGAN) framework by integrating a gradient U-Net (GU-Net) architecture - a hybrid reconstruction model that embeds the measurement operator directly into the network. This framework uses Wasserstein GANs to improve training stability in combination with regularisation terms that combat mode collapse, which are typical problems for conditional GANs. This approach takes as input the dirty image and the point spread function (PSF) of the observation and provides efficient, high-quality image reconstructions that are robust to varying visibility coverages, generalises to images with an increased dynamic range, and provides informative uncertainty quantification. Our methods provide a significant step toward computationally efficient, scalable, and uncertainty-aware imaging for next-generation radio telescopes.",

        "abstract": "We explore the possibility of retrieving cosmological information from 21-cm tomographic data at intermediate redshift. The first step in our approach consists of training an encoder, composed of several three dimensional convolutional layers, to cast the neutral hydrogen 3D data into a lower dimension latent space. Once pre-trained, the featurizer is able to generate 3D grid representations which, in turn, will be mapped onto cosmology ($\\Omega_{\\rm m}$, $\\sigma_{8}$) via likelihood-free inference. For the latter, which is framed as a density estimation problem, we consider a Bayesian approximation method which exploits the capacity of Masked Autoregressive Flow to estimate the posterior. It is found that the representations learned by the deep encoder are separable in latent space. Results show that the neural density estimator, trained on the latent codes, is able to constrain cosmology with a precision of $R^2 \\ge 0.91$ on all parameters and that most of the ground truth of the instances in the test set fall within $1\\sigma$ uncertainty. It is established that the posterior uncertainty from the density estimator is reasonably calibrated. We also investigate the robustness of the feature extractor by using it to compress out-of-distribution dataset, that is either from a different simulation or from the same simulation but at different redshift. We find that, while trained on the latent codes corresponding to different types of out-of-distribution dataset, the probabilistic model is still reasonably capable of constraining cosmology, with $R^2 \\ge 0.80$ in general. This highlights both the predictive power of the density estimator considered in this work and the meaningfulness of the latent codes retrieved by the encoder. We believe that the approach prescribed in this proof of concept will be of great use when analyzing 21-cm data from various surveys in the near future.",

The measured signal is consistent with that from DESI DR2 quasar Ly$\\alpha$ forest spectra at a comparable redshift, validating LBGs as reliable background sources. We also measure the cross-correlation between the LBG Ly$\\alpha$ forest and 13,362 galaxy positions, showing that this observable serves as a sensitive diagnostic for galaxy redshift uncertainties and systematic offsets. Finally, using synthetic LBG spectra and Fisher forecasts, we show that a future wide-area survey over 5000 deg$^2$, targeting 1000 LBGs per deg$^2$ at similar signal-to-noise than our dataset, could enable Ly$\\alpha$ forest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements with 0.4% precision on the isotropic BAO scale and 1.3% on the anisotropic (Alcock-Paczynski) scale.

Published analyses of the system have used spectroscopic light ratios to constrain the eclipse models and found that the secondary star is larger than the primary. This unexpected outcome has been taken as an indication that the system is young and the secondary has yet to reach the main sequence. In this work we present the first analysis of the light curve of the system obtained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), whose quality allows us to avoid using a spectroscopic light ratio to constrain the solution. When combined with literature spectroscopic results we obtain highly precise masses of 2.544 +/- 0.009 Msun and 2.358 +/- 0.009 Msun, and radii of 1.843 +/- 0.002 Rsun and 1.766 +/- 0.003 Rsun. The light ratio is inconsistent with spectroscopic determinations, confirming the suggestion of Takeda (2025) that spectroscopic light ratios of the system are unreliable due the chemical peculiarity of the stars. The properties of the system are matched by theoretical predictions for a slightly super-solar metallicity and an age of 33 +/- 3 Myr: both components are young main-sequence stars.",

While flares have been observed for decades, stellar CMEs remain elusive. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emissions are sensitive to both flares and CME-induced coronal dimming. We assess the detectability of stellar CME-induced EUV dimming events by adapting a known \"Sun-as-a-star\" dimming technique -- validated by the Solar Dynamics Observatory's EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) -- to stellar conditions. We adapt the solar data to reflect a range of stellar intensities, accounting for intrinsic brightness, distance, and interstellar medium (ISM) attenuation. We generate synthetic light curves for two different missions: the legacy EUV Explorer (EUVE) and the proposed ESCAPE mission. Our results indicate that dimming detections are well within reach. EUVE's broadband imager was capable of detecting stellar CMEs -- albeit with limited spectral (temperature) resolution -- but that was not part of the observing plan. EUVE's spectroscopic survey lacked sufficient sensitivity for CME detections. Optimizing modern instrument design for this task would make the observation fully feasible. In this work, we present a tool to explore the stellar-CME detection parameter space. Our tool shows that an instrument with performance similar to ESCAPE, setting a 600-second integration period, and integrating the spectra into bands, any star with an X-ray flux $\\geq 2.51 \\times 10^{-12}$ergs$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$ should have a $\\geq 3\\sigma$ detection even for a modest few-percent dimming profile, regardless of ISM attenuation.

        "abstract": "We study the bolometric evolution of the exceptional Type Ic Supernova (SN) 2022jli, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for its distinctive double-peaked light curve morphology, extended timescales, and the rapid, steep decline in luminosity observed at around 270 days after the SN discovery. We present a quantitative assessment of two leading models through hydrodynamic radiative simulations: two shells enriched with nickel and a combination of nickel and magnetar power. We explore the parameter space of a model in which the SN is powered by radioactive decay assuming a bimodal nickel distribution. While this setup can reproduce the early light curve properties, it faces problems to explain the prominent second peak. We therefore consider a hybrid scenario with a rapidly rotating magnetar as additional energy source. We find that the observed light curve morphology can be well reproduced by a model combining a magnetar engine and a double-layer $^{56}$Ni distribution. The best-fitting case consist of a magnetar with a spin period of $P\\simeq 22$ ms and a bipolar magnetic field strength of $B\\simeq 5\\times 10^{14}$ G and a radioactive content with total nickel mass of 0.15 M$_\\odot$, distributed across two distinct shells within a pre-SN structure of 11 M$_\\odot$. To reproduce the abrupt drop in luminosity at $\\sim 270$ d, the energy deposition from the magnetar must be rapidly and effectively switched off.",

We present a method of stacking up the time-frequency pixel energies through the orbital frequency evolution with the flexibility of gradually shifting the orbital frequency curve along the frequency axis. We observe a distinct energy peak corresponding to the GW signal's quadrupole mode. If an alternative theory of gravity is considered and the analysis of the BBH orbital evolution is executed following GR, the energy distribution on the time-frequency plane will be significantly different. We propose a new consistency test to check whether our theoretical waveform explains the BBH orbital evolution. Through the numerical simulation of beyond-GR theory of gravity and utilizing the framework of second-generation interferometers, we demonstrate the efficiency of this new method in detecting any possible departure from GR.

We model LRDs as super-massive stars (SMSs) surrounded by massive self-gravitating accretion discs (SMDs) that form as a consequence of gas-rich major galaxy mergers. The model provides an excellent match for numerous spectral features of LRDs, where the V-shape arises from the superposition of two black bodies, and Balmer line broadening is sourced by the intrinsic rotation of the SMD. No additional AGN, stellar wind, dust obscuration or galactic component is required. This results in a model with uniquely few, physically motivated free parameters that are robust to variations in observed LRD properties. We perform MCMC fits for two representative LRD spectra, for which the full parameter posterior distributions are determined. Allowing for a compressed SMS mass-radius relation, the recovered parameters are compatible with sub-Eddington accretion in self-gravitating discs, and the recovered SMS masses of few $ 10^6$ M$_{\\odot}$ imply the subsequent formation of massive black holes (BH) that squarely follow the expected BH mass--galaxy mass relation. In addition, the model implies a redshift distribution for LRDs that accurately matches with observations.",

Two-body non-radiative decay could occur in dense matter, such as in the inner dense regions of a core-collapse supernova. We first derive novel bounds on neutrino-Majoron couplings using the spectral distortions induced by neutrino non-radiative two-body decay in matter, and two-dimensional likelihood analyses of the 24 $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ events from SN1987A. We then explore the prospects of neutrino-Majoron couplings from a future galactic core-collapse supernova, leaving either a neutron star or a black-hole. To this aim, we use information from detailed one-dimensional supernova simulations. We consider the supernova neutrino signal associated with inverse-beta decay in the upcoming JUNO and Hyper-Kamiokande detectors, with neutrino-argon scattering in DUNE, or with coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering in the DARWIN experiment. In a full 3$\\nu$ framework, based on the spectral distortions induced by neutrino decay in matter, we perform two-dimensional likelihood analyses and provide prospects for the limits on neutrino-Majoron couplings. Our results show that the observation of a future supernova will significantly improve on the current bounds, in particular from SN1987A and neutrinoless double-beta decay. Finally, we explore the impact of neutrino decay in matter on the diffuse supernova neutrino background formed by past supernova explosions.

Such energetic gamma rays are predicted in cosmogenic models and in scenarios involving non-standard physics. On astrophysical scales, leptonic production of neutrinos could take place in active galactic nuclei cores, where several-TeV gamma rays interact with the X-ray photons from the hot corona. We explore these scenarios within the CRPropa Monte Carlo code framework, developing dedicated tools to account for leptonic production and decay of heavy leptons and hadrons. In particular, the latter are performed by interfacing with the PYTHIA event generator. With these novel tools, we characterise the spectrum and flavour composition of neutrinos emerging from cosmological EM cascades and from leptonic processes in the core of active galactic nuclei.

Additionally, the DESI DR2 data reveals that the value of $\\Omega_m$ fluctuates at the 2.97 $\\sigma$ level as redshift bin increases, particularly within the $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The DESI DR2 LRG1 data at $z_{\\text{eff}} = 0.51$ seem to contradict the results from Type Ia supernovae in the same redshift range. However, it is expected that this discrepancy will become less significant with future DESI data releases, and the trend for $\\Omega_m$ is expected to continue to increase as higher redshifts are considered. The statistical significance of this trend was approximately $1.8 \\sigma$ when only the DESI DR1 data was considered, but, in the light of DESI DR2 data, the significance has decreased to about $0.52 \\sigma$. Despite this reduction, the trend showing an increase in $\\Omega_m$ with higher redshifts remains, though with less statistical confidence. This highlights the importance of understanding why the DESI LRG1 data at $z_{\\text{eff}} = 0.51$ appear to be an outlier in the determination of $\\Omega_m$.",

Utilizing astrometric phase-referencing observations from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), supplemented by archival Very Large Array (VLA) data, we trace the jet geometry of M84 over a broad range of scales, from approximately 10^2 to 10^7 Schwarzschild radii (rs). Our analysis reveals a well-defined transition from a semi-parabolic profile, W(r) proportional to r^0.71, to a conical shape, W(r) proportional to r^1.16, occurring at approximately 1.67 x 10^4 rs. This indicates that the M84 jet is notably less collimated than those in other known LLAGN sources.

Using local shearing box simulations with net vertical flux and a simple cooling prescription, we investigate the effect of magnetic fields on fragmentation in the limit of ideal magnetohydrodyamics. Different levels of in-disk magnetic field from the magnetorotational instability are generated by varying the initial vertical-field plasma beta $\\beta_0$. We find that the disk becomes magnetically dominated when $\\beta_0 < 10^3$, and that this transition is accompanied by a drastic drop in fragmentation (as measured by the bound mass fraction) and gravitational stress. The destabilizing influence of radial magnetic fields, which are present locally and which may promote fragmentation via magnetic tension effects, is overwhelmed by magnetic elevation, which significantly reduces the mid-plane density. The magnetic suppression of fragmentation in magnetically elevated disks has implications for the radial extent of the accretion flow in AGN disks, and for the efficiency of in situ formation of disk-embedded stars that are progenitors for single and binary compact objects.",

We perform a Bayesian analysis of gravitational-wave events following all Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog data, assuming a log-normal PBH mass function. We compute the merger rate distribution of PBH binaries by accounting for gravitational torques from the surrounding PBH. To constrain this rate, we employ the latest limits from the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo.

In astrophysical magnetized plasmas an ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\\gamma}$ induces energy-dependent oscillations in the photon survival probability that imprint modulations on emission spectra. X-ray observations of bright spectrally-smooth sources can provide particularly sensitive probes of ultralight ALPs with masses $m_a \\lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV due to long propagation distances, strong magnetic fields and high photon statistics. We present a comprehensive forecast of ALP-photon conversion in three representative systems: (i) background active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed through foreground intracluster magnetic fields, (ii) central AGNs within their host cluster halos and (iii) Galactic X-ray binaries viewed through the Milky Way field. Using detailed simulations we assess the prospective sensitivity of high-resolution X-ray missions including XRISM, Athena, and Arcus. For typical magnetic field configurations a 5 Ms XRISM observation of the Perseus Cluster AGN NGC 1275 can reach down to $g_{a\\gamma} \\sim 3 \\times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $m_a \\lesssim 10^{-12}$ eV, while Athena's superior energy resolution improves this reach by a factor of $\\sim 3$. We quantify the impact of magnetic field modeling, photon statistics, and spectral binning strategies. Our results demonstrate the scientific potential of high-resolution X-ray observations to probe photon-ALP coupling in previously inaccessible parameter space, offering a powerful window into physics beyond the Standard Model.",

        "title": "Detailed Microwave Continuum Spectra from Bright Protoplanetary Disks in Taurus",
        "abstract": "We present new observations that densely sample the microwave (4-360 GHz) continuum spectra from eight young systems in the Taurus region. Multi-component, empirical model prescriptions were used to disentangle the contributions from their dust disks and other emission mechanisms. We found partially optically thick, free-free emission in all these systems, with positive spectral indices (median $\\alpha_{\\rm c} \\approx 1$ at 10 GHz) and contributing 5-50% of the 43 GHz fluxes. There is no evidence for synchrotron or spinning dust grain emission contributions for these targets. The inferred dust disk spectra all show substantial curvature: their spectral indices decrease with frequency, from $\\alpha_{\\rm d} \\approx 2.8$-4.0 around 43 GHz to 1.7-2.1 around 340 GHz. This curvature suggests that a substantial fraction of the (sub)millimeter ($\\gtrsim$ 200 GHz) dust emission may be optically thick, and therefore the traditional metrics for estimating dust masses are flawed. Assuming the emission at lower frequencies (43 GHz) is optically thin, the local spectral indices and fluxes were used to constrain the disk-averaged dust properties and estimate corresponding dust masses. These masses are roughly an order of magnitude higher ($\\approx 1000 \\, M_\\oplus$) than those found from the traditional approach based on (sub)millimeter fluxes. These findings emphasize the value of broad spectral coverage - particularly extending to lower frequencies ($\\sim$cm-band) - for accurately interpreting dust disk emission; such observations may help reshape our perspective on the available mass budgets for planet formation.",

We modeled SDSS-V DR19 spectra using the NBursts full spectrum fitting technique with E-MILES simple stellar populations (SSP) models and emission line templates to decompose broad and narrow emission line components for correlation with X-ray properties. We place the galaxies on the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram to diagnose their dominant excitation mechanism. We show that the consistent use of the narrow component fluxes shifts most galaxies systematically and significantly upward to the active galactic nuclei (AGN) region on the BPT diagram. On this basis, we confirm the dependence between a galaxys position on the BPT diagram and its (0.2-2.3 keV) X-ray/H$\\alpha$ flux ratio. We also verified the correlation between X-ray luminosity and emission line luminosities of the narrow [O\\iii]$\\lambda 5007$ and broad H$\\alpha$ component; as well as the relations between the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) mass, the X-ray luminosity, and the velocity dispersion of the stellar component ($\\sigma_{*}$) on the base on the unique sample of optical spectroscopic follow-up of X-ray sources detected by eROSITA.

We formulate tidal heating in helium composition extremely low mass white dwarf (ELM WD) components of detached DWDBs which reach mass transfer within a Hubble time. We combine a mass radius relation which varies with surface temperature and the tidal friction model of Hut 1981, where the additional orbital energy loss from tidal friction is accounted for by increases in the primary surface temperature, and hence increasing radius. Applying this heating model to the current sample of binaries with ZTF, we predict temperature increases from the present day of up to $\\sim$40\\% before the onset of mass transfer. We find that helium white dwarfs are generically hot and large at the onset of mass transfer, even for the oldest DWDBs whose components can cool to be degenerate by the present day. In the population of Galactic DWDBs, we find that the onset of mass transfer should occur at orbital periods as long as 1000s (17 minutes), or binary gravitational wave frequency of 2 mHz. This is over three times longer than periods expected for degenerate WD (5 minutes). Since mass transferring DWDBs are progenitors for a variety of transients and stellar populations e.g. RCrB stars, AM CVn binaries, type .Ia supernova, the finite temperature of donor white dwarfs should be taken into account.",

The code models dust collisional evolution and transport in the vertical and radial directions. The currently included collisional outcomes are dust growth by sticking, fragmentation of dust particles and erosion, where a small particle chips a portion of the large particle. We employ a representative particle approach to track a limited number of particles instead of tracking every particle, saving computational time. We have a static power-law gas disk with temperature assumed to be vertically isothermal. Dust coagulation depends on the local gas properties, and therefore, we bin particles into grids and perform collisions. We make use of an adaptive grid approach where we make sure that each cell has an equal number of representative particles. This guarantees that there are always sufficient particles to resolve the physics of collisions. The code resolves dust coagulation in 2D(r-z).

By applying a classical galactic dynamics model, we calculate the radii and rotational velocities of the nuclear rings for all barred DPGs, and compare them with the observed properties of their DPSs. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between the predicted radii of the nuclear rings and the maximum centric distances of the DPSs, as well as a marginal correlation between the predicted rotational velocities of the nuclear rings and the observed maximum velocity differences of the DPSs. These findings provide strong evidence to support the hypothesis that the DPSs of a barred DPG in MaNGA primarily originate from the convolution of the PSF effect with its bar-induced fast-rotating gaseous nuclear ring.",

We report redshifts and mass estimates for 9977 clusters detected via their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect with signal-to-noise greater than 4 at a 2.4 arcminute filter scale. The catalog includes 1166 clusters at redshifts greater than 1, and 121 clusters at redshifts greater than 1.5.

El Gordo, a cluster found in an initial ACT survey of 755 square degrees, remains the most extreme cluster in mass and redshift; we find no cluster with a mass and redshift combination high enough to falsify the standard LCDM cosmology with Gaussian initial perturbations.

Two dipole oscillations around different axes in the orbital plane are present as well. In addition, the binary system is characterized using new radial velocity measurements, phoebe as well as simultaneous spectral energy distribution and light curve modeling. The pulsating primary component has properties typical of a Delta Scuti star but has accreted and is still accreting mass from its Roche Lobe filling companion.

        "abstract": "The Quintuplet cluster, located in the Galactic centre, is one of the few young massive clusters in the Milky Way. It allows us to study dozens of massive, post main sequence stars individually, providing unique insights into the properties of the most massive stars. Our goal is to study the radio continuum emission of the most massive stars in the cluster.   We carried out a total of nine observations (three in the C- and six in the X-band) of the Quintuplet cluster with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in A-configuration. We cross-matched the detected sources with infrared stellar catalogues to ensure cluster membership, calculated their spectral indices, quantified variability, and inferred clumping-scaled mass-loss rates   We present the most complete catalogue of radio stars in the Quintuplet cluster to date, with a total of 41 detections, and the deepest images of the cluster in the 4 to 12 GHz range (reaching an rms noise level of $2.3\\, \\mu\\mathrm{Jy/beam}$ in the X-band). The six year baseline of our observations allowed us to perform a robust variability assessment, finding that around $60\\%$ of the Quintuplet radio-stars are variable on timescales of months to years. We derived the spectral indices of 28 out of the 41 sources. Based on their spectral indices and variability, we classify 11 of them as colliding-wind binaries, seven as strictly thermal sources, and ten as ambiguous. Including the ambiguous sources, we estimate a multiplicity fraction of ($75\\pm22\\%$). We also computed upper limits for the mass-loss rates of the thermal radio-stars, finding them in agreement with typical values for WNh and WC stars. Finally, we compare these results to the ones obtained from our analogous study of the Arches cluster.",

        "abstract": "Pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISNe) are transient events occurring in progenitor stars with helium cores of approximately 32-65 solar masses, where rapid electron-positron pair production induces pressure loss, collapse, and pulsations driving episodic mass loss. The number, strength, and duration of these pulses can lead to shell collisions that produce shock-powered transients, potentially explaining some of the most luminous events, such as superluminous supernovae, and other rare transients. Rapid progenitor rotation lowers the PPISN mass threshold and influences the dynamics, energetics, and chemical composition of PPISN-driven pulses. In this study, we computed 1D evolutionary models of massive, rotating PPISN progenitor stars with zero-age main-sequence masses of 85-140 solar masses and solar metallicity and 10% solar metallicity. Our analysis reveals strong correlations between PPISN ejected mass and total energy as well as between ejected mass and peak ejected shell velocity. Additionally, moderate correlations indicate that higher initial PPISN progenitor mass leads to greater mass ejection and energy release, while negative correlations show that rapid rotation appears to reduce mass ejection and kinetic energy of the shells. Subsequent pulses lead to hydrogen-poor, carbon- and oxygen-enriched ejected shells, indicating the effect of rotationally-induced chemical mixing in PPISN-driven episodic mass loss with implications for their transients. We model the light curve and synthetic spectra that arise from the collision of two H-poor shells for one of our models using the radiation transport code SuperLite. We find that shock-heated H-poor PPISN shell collisions from rapidly rotating progenitors can lead to moderately luminous H-poor transients that share some similarities with observed SLSN-I events.",

The associated brightness variations over time, in particular high magnification events (HMEs) and caustic crossings, can yield precise constraints due to their strong dependence on the relative projected velocities of the components and accretion disk size. The next generation of large sky area surveys, such as The Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST) and Euclid, are expected to find and follow-up thousands of lensed quasars from which such events could be identified and observed. In this work we present a characterization and estimation of all HMEs that could potentially be observed, focusing on systems that could be identified by ground based telescopes. From systems whose minimum image separation is at least 1 arcsec, and their second dimmest image is at least 21.5 magnitudes in the i-band ($\\sim560$ in the southern or northern sky), we estimate $\\sim60$ HMEs with amplitudes $>0.3$ [mag] in the r-band per year.

Two cases are possible, depending on whether the RSB scale is much larger than the electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking scale or not. When it is, the dominant reheating mechanism can be the decays of the field responsible for RSB in the Standard Model (SM) sector. We point out that in a similar way dark matter (DM) can be produced and we analyze in some detail the case of a sterile-neutrino, finding that the full DM abundance is reproduced when this particle is at the $10^2$ MeV scale in a well-motivated SM completion. When the RSB scale is not much larger than the EW symmetry breaking scale, we find that efficient reheating always occurs when the energy density of the false vacuum is first entirely transferred to a dark photon and then to SM fermions via dark-photon decays.",

It is therefore possible that there exists some time-dependent component to planet occurrence in the Milky Way over Gyr timescales, driven by something other than the metal enrichment of the ISM. In this paper, we investigate the observable effect of a time-dependent planet occurrence rate upon a Kepler-like sample of stars. Using a novel planetary system population synthesis code, psps, we impose several prescriptions for time-variable planet occurrence upon our sample. For this study, we employ a simplistic step function fiducial model for Milky Way planet occurrence, where we vary the time of the step and the planet occurrence rate before and after. We then forward model the expected yield for a synthetic Kepler mission as a function of galactic height, employing the mission's footprint and sensitivity to transits. Finally, we compare the modeled trends to the observed result from the mission itself. We find that, broadly speaking, models in which planet occurrence increased by a factor of several within the past few Gyr can reproduce the occurrence-galactic height trend as-observed; this timing is broadly consistent with the galactic kinematic heating timescale. We consider how varying the functional form of our planet occurrence prescription affects our conclusions. Finally, we consider the physical implications of a seemingly recent increase in planet occurrence on Gyr timescales, as part of a broader conversation about the galactic context for planet formation.",

For the analysis, we consider observational datasets of Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) peak parameters. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is utilized to constrain the bestfit values of the model parameters. For this purpose, we use the publicly available Python code from CosmoMC and have developed the contour plots with different constraint limits.

In both these cases, we derive the conservation equations and analyze two representative fluid models: a barotropic perfect fluid and a constituent with an exponential density profile. By varying the parameters across regimes, we locate critical (sonic) points and integrate velocity, density and pressure profiles. While near-horizon inflow velocities are similar across the different solutions, we find that the critical radius and the resulting accretion rates and luminosities severely change, depending on the value of the parameter and type of fluid. Remarkably, the barotropic and exponential cases exhibit different trends in the outer regions. Moreover, by extending the analysis to the charged SV spacetime, we find that the presence of a central charge $Q$ produces additional, albeit modest, shifts in the sonic radius which, in combination with those induced by the regularization parameter $\\ell$, could provide a double observational marker. In particular, while $\\ell$ acts predominantly on the position of the critical point, in the barotropic fluid case, the electromagnetic contribution of $Q$ slightly dampens the inflow velocity near the horizon.",

Observations with RXTE have shown that the strongest X-ray variability appears in the transition from/to the flaring state. During this transition, it has been proposed that two particular types of quasi-periodic oscillations might be connected with the ejection of the so-called ultra-relativistic flows. In this paper, we present an analysis of the first NICER observations of Sco X-1 obtained during a multi-wavelenght campaign conducted in February 2019, in order to characterise the properties of QPOs as the system evolves through its various accretion states. We compute a light-curve and a Hardness-Intensity diagram to track the evolution of the source spectral properties, while we investigate the X-ray time variability with a Dynamical Power Density Spectrum. To trace the temporal evolution of QPOs, we segment the dataset into shorter, continuous intervals, and compute and fit the averaged PDS for each interval. Our analysis shows that the overall behaviour of the source is consistent with the literature; strong QPOs around 6 Hz are detected on the normal branch, while transitions to/from the flaring branch -- occurring over timescales of a few hundreds of seconds -- are characterised by rapid, weaker quasi-periodic variability reaching frequencies up to 15 Hz. Despite limited statistical significance, we also identify faint, transient timing features above 20 Hz, occasionally coexisting with the prominent 6 Hz QPOs. Although tentative, the existence of these features in the NICER data is crucial for interpreting the simultaneous radio observations from the same multi-wavelength campaign, potentially reinforcing the connection between the ejection of relativistic outflows and the accretion states in Sco X-1.",

We find that one-zone leptonic model with log-parabolic (LP) EED can successfully fit the GeV-TeV emission of blazars. The synchrotron frequency $\\nu_s$ of blazars mainly evolves due to variation of electron peak energy $\\gamma_{3p}$. The BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) show a negative trend in the $\\nu_s- \\nu_s L_s$ SED plane, known as blazar sequence, that does not seem to be an artifact of Doppler boosting, but driven by the equipartition constraints. A positive correlation is found between the derived magnetic field $B$ and electron density $n_e$, whereas $n_e$ and $\\gamma_{3p}$ negatively relate, as expected in an equipartition scenario. The flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) deviate significantly from such a scenario, indicating their jet parameters should be varying independently. The synchrotron peak frequency $\\nu_s$ and its spectral curvature $b_s$ negatively correlate for all blazars, confirming the stochastic particle acceleration in blazar jets. However, blazars do not show the signature of hard-sphere acceleration, indicating that magnetic turbulence in the jets might be soft and physical conditions might be near to steady state, consistent with equipartition. Furthermore, for BL Lacs, the SED curvature $b_s$ and the EED curvature $r$ and nearly meet the theoretical relationship $r=5b_s$, whereas the FSRQs show large deviation due to poor constrain on $b_s$ due to presence of thermal component.",

However, the inherent sparsity of these measurements raises concerns regarding the feasibility of this approach. We assessed the achievable accuracy of UHECR backtracking using mock sparse local GMF data derived from the Jansson & Farrar 2012 (JF12) GMF model and mock UHECR events. We created mock UHECR datasets that trace back within a 3 degree angular range from the galaxy M82 (a hypothesized UHECR source), and we investigated the impact on such backtracking attempts of varying GMF measurement sparsity and of varying GMF strength, which we emulated by rescaling the strength of the ordered components of the JF12 model. We found that: (a) for an average GMF strength of $1\\mu G$, satisfactory backtracking results for magnetic rigidities of $10^{20}$ eV can be obtained even with very sparse measurements ($ \\sim 1600$ pc); (b) when the average GMF strength is significantly increased ($\\sim$ factor of 10) the accuracy of backtracking breaks down at measurement spacings of 400 pc. These findings emphasize on one hand that sparsity is not an automatic deal-breaker for the utility of local GMF measurements in UHECR backtracking. On the other hand, we also confirm that important challenges remain on the path from sparse local GMF measurements to precise charge-particle astronomy, especially in directions of high-strength ordered magnetic fields. This underscores the importance of using all available complementary magnetic field measurements and sophisticated reconstruction techniques to enable accurate backtracking of UHECR.",

        "abstract": "The Near-InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS) is a high-resolution, high-stability near-infrared (NIR) spectrograph equipped with an AO system. Installed on the ESO 3.6-m telescope, it was developed to enable radial velocity (RV) measurements of low-mass exoplanets around M dwarfs and to characterise exoplanet atmospheres in the NIR. This paper provides a comprehensive design overview and characterisation of the NIRPS instrument, reporting on its on-sky performance, and presenting its GTO programme. The instrument started its operations on 1 Apr 2023 after intensive on-sky testing phases. The spectral range continuously covers the Y, J, and H bands from 972.4 to 1919.6 nm. The thermal control system maintains 1 mK stability over several months. The NIRPS AO-assisted fibre link improves coupling efficiency and offers a unique high-angular resolution capability with a fibre acceptance of only 0.4 arcsec. A high spectral resolving power of 90 000 and 75 000 is provided in HA and HE modes, respectively. The overall throughput from the top of the atmosphere to the detector peaks at 13 percent. The RV precision, measured on the bright star Proxima with a known exoplanetary system, is 77 cm/s. NIRPS and HARPS can be used simultaneously, offering unprecedented spectral coverage for spectroscopic characterisation and stellar activity mitigation. Modal noise can be aptly mitigated by the implementation of fibre stretchers and AO scanning mode. Initial results confirm that NIRPS opens new possibilities for RV measurements, stellar characterisation, and exoplanet atmosphere studies with high precision and high spectral fidelity. NIRPS demonstrated stable RV precision at the level of 1 m/s over several weeks. The instrument high throughput offers a notable improvement over previous spectrographs, enhancing our ability to detect small exoplanets.",

        "abstract": "Strange quark stars (SQSs), namely compact stars entirely composed of deconfined quark matter, are characterized by similar masses and compactness to neutron stars (NSs) and have been theoretically proposed to exist in the Universe since the 1970s. However, multiwavelength observations of compact stars in the last 50 years have not yet led to an unambiguous SQS identification. This article explores whether SQSs could form in the supernova (SN) explosion of an evolved star (e.g., carbon-oxygen, or Wolf-Rayet) occurring in a binary with the companion being a neutron star (NS). The collapse of the iron core of the evolved star generates a newborn NS and the SN explosion. Part of the ejected matter accretes onto the NS companion as well as onto the newborn NS via matter fallback. The accretion occurs at hypercritical (highly super-Eddington) rates, transferring mass and angular momentum to the stars. We present numerical simulations of this scenario and demonstrate that the density increase in the NS interiors during the accretion process may induce quark matter deconfinement, suggesting the possibility of SQS formation. We discuss the astrophysical conditions under which such a transformation may occur and possible consequences.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for real-time nighttime cloud detection, tracking, and prediction using all-sky cameras, aimed at enhancing the efficiency of ground-based robotic telescopes. Ground-based telescopes are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, particularly cloud cover, which can lead to the loss of valuable observation time and potential damage to the telescope. Existing methods for cloud detection have limitations in accuracy, particularly under varying illumination conditions such as gibbous moon phases. To address these challenges, we developed an algorithm that uses the temporal incoherence of image sequences from all-sky cameras. The method computes difference images to highlight moving cloud structures, applies Otsu thresholding to generate binary cloud maps, and uses mathematical morphology techniques to reduce noise from bright stars and other artifacts. Segmented cloud regions are then tracked across successive frames, allowing estimation of a velocity vector and enabling short-term predictions of cloud movement. Our approach achieves reliable cloud detection and tracking, providing predictions up to 15 minutes into the future - a capability critical for robotic telescopes that rely on look-ahead scheduling. The system was validated against extensive historical data from the Liverpool Telescope's Skycam A and T systems, achieving a false positive rate of approximately 1% and a similar false negative rate, depending on cloud thickness and speed. By improving cloud forecasting and observational scheduling, the system offers a valuable tool for enhancing the operational reliability of robotic telescopes.",

The detection and statistics of solar active regions have been forefront topics in solar physics. In this study, we developed a solar active region detector (SARD) based on the advanced object detection model YOLOv8. First, we applied image processing techniques including thresholding and morphological operations to 6975 line-of-sight magnetograms from 2010 to 2019 at a cadence of 12~h, obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory. With manual refinement, we labeled 26531 active regions in the dataset for further training and test with the detection model. Without any overlap between the training and test sets, the superior performance of SARD is demonstrated by an average precision rate as high as 94\\%. We then performed a statistical analysis on the area and magnetic flux of the detected active regions, both of which yield log-normal distributions. This result sheds light on the underlying complexity and multi-scale nature of solar active regions.",

The absence of convincing electromagnetic counterparts motivates exploration of exotic origins beyond standard astrophysical processes. We present a vector dark matter model based on a new $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry to interpret this event through superheavy dark matter decay. Our analysis demonstrates that dark matter lifetimes in the range $7.3 \\times 10^{28}$ to $2.9 \\times 10^{30}$ s can successfully account for the KM3-230213A event while satisfying stringent constraints from gamma-ray observations. Moreover, the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_X$ in our model naturally predicts cosmic string formation, generating a stochastic gravitational wave background with string tension $4.5 \\times 10^{-11} \\lesssim G\\mu \\lesssim 1.2 \\times 10^{-10}$, consistent with recent pulsar timing array observations. This multi-messenger consistency across neutrinos, gamma-rays, and gravitational waves validates our vector dark matter interpretation of the KM3-230213A event while providing testable predictions for upcoming multi-wavelength experiments.",

        "abstract": "Cygnus X-3 is the only known Galactic high-mass X-ray binary with a Wolf-Rayet companion. Recent X-ray polarimetry results with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer have revealed it as a concealed ultraluminous X-ray source. It is also the first source where pronounced orbital variability of X-ray polarization has been detected -- notably with only one polarization maximum per orbit. Polarization caused by scattering of the source X-rays can only be orbitally variable if the scattering angles change throughout the orbit. Since this requires an asymmetrically distributed medium around the compact object, the observed variability traces the intrabinary structures. The single-peaked profile further imposes constraints on the possible geometry of the surrounding medium. Therefore, the X-ray polarization of Cygnus X-3 is the first opportunity to study the wind structures of high-mass X-ray binaries in detail. We aim to uncover the underlying geometry through analytical modeling of the polarized variability. Knowledge of these structures could be extended to other sources with similar wind-binary interactions. We study the variability caused by single scattering in the intrabinary bow shock, exploring both the optically thin and optically thick limits. We consider two geometries of the reflecting medium, the axisymmetric parabolic bow shock and the parabolic cylinder shock, and determine the geometry that best matches the X-ray polarimetric data. We find that the peculiar properties of the data can only be replicated with a cylindrical bow shock with asymmetry across the shock centerline and significant optical depth. This geometry is comparable to shocks formed by the jet-wind or outflow-wind interactions. The position angle of the orbital axis is slightly misaligned from the orientation of the radio jet in all our model fits.",

        "abstract": "A well-established result in quantum field theory in four-dimensional de Sitter space is that the vacuum state of a massless scalar field breaks the de Sitter isometry group, leading to time-dependent (secular) growth in correlation functions computed in inflationary coordinates. This behavior is widely believed to extend to more general theories involving light scalar fields with weak non-derivative interactions. In such cases, secular growth is thought to be further amplified by loop corrections, and the stochastic formalism is often regarded as the appropriate framework to resum these infrared effects. In this article we challenge this prevailing view. A crucial distinction must be made between two cases: a massless scalar field protected by a shift symmetry, and a light scalar without such a symmetry. In the former, the shift symmetry enforces derivative interactions, yielding observables in which secular growth plays no physical role. In the latter, although correlation functions develop infrared divergences in the massless limit, they remain fully invariant under the de Sitter isometry group. We analyze the structure of these divergences arising from loop integrals and show that, in the soft-momentum limit, they do not alter the time dependence of tree-level correlators. In fact, using a de Sitter-invariant renormalization scheme based on Wilson's axioms for integration, these divergences can be systematically removed order by order. We therefore conclude that neither massless nor light scalar fields in de Sitter space exhibit genuine secular growth. We further discuss the implications of these findings for the validity and scope of the stochastic approach to inflation.",

        "abstract": "The standard approach to searching for gravitational wave signatures in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has been to compare the theoretical Hellings and Downs (HD) curve with the observed correlations in pulsar timing residuals as a function of angular separation on the sky between pulsar pairs. While this approach has successfully produced evidence for the presence of nanohertz-wavelength gravitational waves, it does not, on its own, produce any directional information. It is also insensitive to the polarization of the gravitational waves. An alternative approach is to construct maps of the gravitational wave distribution on the sky. In this paper, we present a simple quadratic estimator of the gravitational wave power as a function of direction on the sky that is sensitive to the polarization state of the wave. In this way, we describe the full, $S_2 \\times S_2$, state-space of a polarized gravitational wave background across the sky and the Poincar\\'e sphere describing polarization. A natural question arises from this perspective: what is the resolution of a polarized sky-map, i.e. effectively how many independent pixels can a such a map contain? In other words, how many distinct gravitational waves can a PTA, in principle, distinguish? It turns out the answer is finite, and is approximately $N_{\\rm res} = 16 \\times 2 = 32$, where 16 is the number of resolvable sky-positions and 2 is the number of distinct polarization states. This corresponds to an angular resolution of $58^\\circ$, which can be achieved by a PTA with more than $N_{\\rm pulsar} \\gtrsim 20$ pulsars. We demonstrate that the variance of the map is equivalent to the HD significance, while for a single point source, a 3-$\\sigma$ HD signal corresponds to a 5.2-$\\sigma$ map significance.",

        "abstract": "It has remained challenging to reliably identify sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), despite them being expected to be ubiquitous. We propose a new method using multi-band continuum reverberation mapping to identify low-mass-ratio SMBHBs in active galactic nuclei. The basic principle is that, due to the presence of a low-density cavity between the mini-disks and the circumbinary disk, the continuum emissions show a deficit at certain wavelengths, leading to a distinguishing feature in the relation between the inter-band time lag and wavelengths $\\tau(\\lambda)$. Specifically, the relation appears flat at short wavelengths because of the truncated sizes of the mini-disks and transits to a power law $\\lambda^{4/3}$ at long wavelength stemming from the circumbinary disk. This transition feature is distinct from the uniform relation $\\lambda^{4/3}$ of the standard accretion disk around a single black hole. Using the lamp-post scenario and assuming that only the secondary black hole is active in a low-mass-ratio SMBHB, we design a simple continuum reverberation model to calculate the transfer function of the accretion disks and the resulting $\\tau(\\lambda)$ relations for various SMBHB orbital parameters. The transition wavelength typically can lie at UV/optical bands, mainly depending on the total mass and orbital separation of the SMBHB. We apply our SMBHB model to the intensive multiwavelength monitoring data of the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and find that the SMBHB model can reproduce the inter-band time lags. Remarkably, the inferred total mass and orbital period from the SMBHB fitting are consistent with values derived from other independent methods.",

We report the first detection of weak PAH emission at 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 microns in the Spitzer/IRS spectrum from 2005. The inner wall destruction in the 2022 JWST epoch allowed more ultraviolet photons to reach the outer disk, increasing the flux levels of PAH bands and enabling their detection well above the continuum. The 11.2 micron PAH flux increases by a factor of three, yet its profile shape remains remarkably stable. The 6.2/11.2 micron flux ratio has increased, but the charge state of the PAH population remains 75% neutral. The PAH features exhibit a \"class C\" spectral profile, with redshifted peaks and broadened wings consistent with emission from low-mass T Tauri disks. A weak 12.7/11.2 micron ratio points to a lower abundance of duo- and trio-hydrogen modes, implying a predominantly zigzag carbon structure. A faint \"class A\" sub-component in the 6.2 and 7.7 micron bands may indicate additional PAH processing by ultraviolet radiation from accretion hotspots. Placement on PAH charge-size grids locates T Cha in the low-ionisation, small-size regime (NC <= 30), signifying a largely neutral PAH population across multiple epochs spanning 18 years. Through multi-epoch, high-resolution data from JWST and Spitzer, we identify T Cha as a benchmark source for probing disk evolution and PAH processing, emphasizing the potential of temporal monitoring with JWST.",

An active Anticoincidence System (ACS) of BGO scintillators surrounds the GeDs to reduce the background and contribute to the detection of transient events. Accurately modeling the ACS performance requires simulating the intricate scintillation processes within the shields, which significantly increases the computational cost. We have encoded these effects into a correction matrix derived from dedicated Geant4 simulations with the inclusion of the optical physics. For this purpose, we use laboratory measurements for the energy and spatial response of the ACS lateral wall to benchmark the simulation and define instrument parameters, including the BGO absorption length and the electronic noise. We demonstrate that the simulations replicate the experimental energy resolution and light collection uniformity along the BGO crystal, with maximum discrepancies of 20% and 10%, respectively. The validated simulations are then used to develop the correction matrix for the lateral wall, accounting for the light collection efficiency and energy resolution based on the position within the crystal. The gamma-ray quantum detection efficiency is also position-dependent via the inclusion of the optical physics. It is enhanced by $\\sim$8% close to the SiPMs and suppressed by $\\sim$2% in the adjacent corners with respect to the average value. Finally, we explore the energy threshold and resolution of the bottom ACS, considering the impact of its smaller crystals compared with the lateral walls.",

We investigate the effect of the LV parameter $l$ on the fluid density $\\rho(r)$, radial velocity $u(r)$, and accretion rate $\\dot{M}$. Using a Hamiltonian dynamical systems approach, we examine the behavior near critical points and identify the sonic transitions in each scenario. Our results show that the LV parameter influences the location of critical points, the flow structure, and the accretion rate, with $l>0$ ($l<0$) enhancing (suppressing) the latter. For ultra-stiff fluids, no critical points are found, and the flow remains entirely subsonic. For ultra-relativistic and radiation fluids, transonic solutions exist, with the position of the sonic point depending on the sign of $l$. We also analyze polytropic fluids $p=\\mathcal{K} \\rho^{\\Gamma}$ with $\\Gamma=5/3$ and $\\Gamma=4/3$, observing similar qualitative behavior, where the sonic transition is affected by both the equation of state and the LV parameter.

We validate this thesis comparing the smoothed time series of solar wind speed measured by Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and various indices of CH areas constructed from the CH catalog compiled at the Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station for the period 2010-2025. The main result is that we find specific indices of CH areas that give a strong correlation with smoothed solar wind speed variations. As an example, 1-year averaged areas of CHs located within 30 degrees of the solar equator yield a correlation of 0.9 with 1-year averaged solar wind speed. This strong correlation is a feature of the particular CH catalog, and considering an alternative CH catalog obtained using the Spatial Possibilistic Clustering Algorithm (SPoCA) from the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), the same index provides a correlation of only 0.3. Although the fact that the correlation significantly depends on the catalog requires a separate discussion, we conclude that if some of the catalogs can be used to construct a reliable indicator of solar wind speed variations, then this methodology should be maintained further. Additionally, we present time-latitude diagrams of rolling correlation between CHs areas and solar wind speed, which, in our opinion, can be used to reveal source CHs for high-speed solar wind streams.",

Approximately 40 precursor radial velocity measurements with 1 m/s precision are required to adequately constrain orbital parameters before HWO observations. We demonstrate that 6-8 astrometric measurements distributed across the mission timeline, compared to radial velocity constraints alone and to astrometry constraints alone, significantly improve orbital parameter precision, enabling direct determination of orbital inclination with uncertainties of 0.8-3 degrees. For habitable-zone planet characterization, 4-5 epochs provide moderate confidence, while high-confidence (95%) confirmation requires 8+ observations.

The nearby CWB system $\\gamma^2$ Velorum (WR 11), composed of a Wolf-Rayet (WR) and an O-star, has been recently associated with GeV gamma-ray emission observed by Fermi-LAT, including evidence of orbital variability. This offers a valuable opportunity to test models of phase-dependent hadronic emission and absorption in CWBs. We aim to explain both the spectral energy distribution (SED) and orbital variability of gamma-ray emission from $\\gamma^2$ Velorum using a physically motivated phase-dependent hadronic model. We consider the injection of accelerated relativistic protons based on the WR wind's kinetic energy intercepted at the wind collision region (WCR), and calculate the resulting phase-dependent hadronic gamma-ray emission assuming a proton conversion efficiency $\\eta_p$ and accounting for energy-dependent diffusion, advection, conical shock interception and the evolution of the effective acceleration volume, assumed to scale with the WCR, with the orbital phase. Gamma-ray emission from hadronic interactions is attenuated by $\\gamma$ - $\\gamma$ absorption, calculated via full angular integration over both stellar photon fields. Our model successfully reproduces the observed SED and is consistent with the apastron-to-periastron flux ratio, resulting in a dip in emission at periastron passage and an increase during apastron. Our findings support the conclusion that the observed orbital modulation is primarily driven by geometric variations of the WCR. This underscores the significant influence of evolving orbital geometry on the high-energy gamma-ray light curves of $\\gamma^2$ Velorum.",

The approximations are tested with the application to the typical problem of statistical hypothesis testing. It is found that a Laplace distribution of suitable scale parameter can approximate quantiles of the Bessel distribution with better than 10% accuracy, with the computational advantage associated with the use of simple elementary functions instead of special functions.

        "abstract": "Over the last few years, an increasing number of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) have been detected with very high energy (VHE) emission in excess of 100 GeV, with a few cases above 1 TeV. In several instances, synchrotron seed photons do not fully explain the emission observed, suggesting the presence of other seed photon sources to up-scatter. In this work, we consider the kilonova as a source of seed photons for up-scattering in the afterglow. We model the kilonova as a thermal source injecting into the back of a GRB fireball, evolved using a shell model, and with the electron and photon populations updated via a kinetic solver. We find that VHE emission from weaker afterglows, such as those found in short GRBs, can be affected by such seed photons, with the kilonova seed photons mitigating the loss of synchrotron photons on the VHE emission when afterglow parameters are varied. We also find that VHE emission in structured jets, due to weaker synchrotron emission at their wings, can also benefit from this supply of seed photons, especially when viewed off-axis. We apply this model to GRB 170817A, and show that its VHE emission is higher than expected in previous models for the first 100 days, though still below the detection threshold.",

We observed the PPNe CRL 618 and OH231.8+4.2 in 850 $\\mu$m polarized light. In both cases, we observe ordered magnetic fields that appear to arise from dusty circumstellar material that has been swept up by the passage of outflows driven by the central post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) star. CRL 618 shows a magnetic field aligned with one of the most extreme position angles of the outflowing bullets ejected from the central source. We hypothesize that polarized emission in CRL 618 may preferentially arise from material in the walls of the dust cavity opened by the ejected bullets. Conversely, OH231.8+4.2 shows a magnetic field that is aligned approximately perpendicular to the outflow direction, which may preferentially arise from an infrared-bright dense clump embedded near the base of the outflow. Despite CRL 618 being carbon-rich and OH231.8+4.2 being oxygen-rich, there is no significant difference in the polarization fractions of the two sources. This suggests that at linear resolutions $\\sim 10^{4}$ au, the complexity of the magnetic field geometry on scales smaller than the beam, rather than grain composition, sets the measured polarization fraction of these sources.",

        "title": "Evaluation of gamma-ray response of the AstroPix4 HV-CMOS active pixel sensor",
        "abstract": "AstroPix is a novel high-voltage CMOS active pixel sensor being developed for a next generation gamma-ray space telescope, AMEGO-X. To meet AMEGO-X instrument requirements, AstroPix must achieve full depletion of its $500~\\rm{\\mu m}$ thick, $500~\\rm{\\mu m}$-pitch pixels. It must be sensitive to gamma rays in the range of $25-700$ keV, with the energy resolution at 122 keV of $<10$%. Furthermore, given the space-based nature of AMEGO-X, the power consumption of AstroPix needs to be lower than $1.5~\\rm{mW/{cm}^2}$. We report the gamma-ray response of the latest version of AstroPix, AstroPix4. The chip contains $16\\times 13$ array of $500~\\rm{\\mu m}$-pitch pixels. The power consumption is estimated to be about $2~\\rm{mW/{cm}^2}$, which is approximately half the power of the previous AstroPix version. The input capacitance is reduced, allowing for the detection of the 14 keV photopeak from $\\rm{^{57}Co}$ and a moderate energy resolution of 14% at 122 keV. The dynamic range is estimated to be in the range from 14 keV to $\\sim250$ keV. We found that the sensor depletion layer expands as expected and the measured depletion depth is approximately $90~\\rm{\\mu m}$ when biased at $-240$ V.",

        "title": "Sun sensor calibration algorithms: A systematic mapping and survey",
        "abstract": "Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these, sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun sensor modeling and calibration techniques.",

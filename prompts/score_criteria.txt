## Scoring Criteria

> The "Relevance" score measures how closely the paper aligns with the core topics of the prompt.
> The "Novelty" score assesses the originality and impact of the paper.
> They are two **ORTHONORMAL** axes and **SHOULD NOT** be confused with each other.

### Relevance Scoring

- Relevance 9-10 (Completely Relevant)
  - Focus: Fully aligned with core topics with no deviation, score the highest if contains relevant keywords in it.
  - Examples: Papers focused on foundational methods or theoretical research whose topic directly relates to core topics.

- Relevance 7-8 (Relevant)
  - Focus: Retain a solid link to the main research area, though may touch on peripheral elements.
  - Examples: Papers whose topics generally align with the core topics, but may other aspects or applications not directly related to the core topics.

- Relevance 5-6 (Borderline)
  - Focus: Maintains a link to the core topics but also extends into at least one other domain/area beyond the primary focus.
  - Examples: Papers whose results have implications for the core topics but are not directly related to the core topics.

- Relevance 3-4 (Irrelevant)
  - Focus: Largely outside our interests with only very weak association to our topics.
  - Examples: Papers whose results may have limited impact on the core topics and are not directly related to the core topics.

- Relevance 1-2 (Ignore)
  - Focus: Purely unrelated to our topics. Completely a different domain.

### Novelty Scoring

- Novelty 9-10 (Breakthrough)
  - Definition: Groundbreaking methods/theory/application introducing new directions or solving major challenges.
  - Examples: Entirely new paradigm for core topics.

- Novelty 7-8 (Improvements)
  - Definition: Substantial insights/enhancements, though not a full paradigm shift.
  - Examples: Modifications on existing methods yielding significantly better results. Applications to new datasets that directly address the core topics. Re-analysis of old datasets using new methods that directly address the core topics.

- Novelty 5-6 (Borderline)
  - Definition: Incremental contributions with possible long-term benefits, not immediately transformative.

- Novelty 3-4 (Tangential)
  - Definition: Minor or domain-specific improvements with limited broader impact.

- Novelty 1-2 (Low)
  - Definition: Methods/application not applicable to core topics.
